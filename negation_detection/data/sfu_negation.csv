I have read all of Grisham's books and this was by far the most boring one!,0
The story is about a lawyer who gives up his high paying job to help the homeless in an office staffed by 2 other people.,0
There is no mystery to the story.,1
"Grisham's books are normally mysterious, can't wait to finish it, a"" who done it"" style.",1
"This book does not have any surprises, its dull.",1
I expected a book like other books ( f.i.,0
Pelican Brief etc ) he has written.,0
It definitely was not!,1
I would definitely not recommend it to anybody,1
"When I read a John Grisham book, I do not expect literary greatness as one would expect when picking up a Charles Dickens tome.",1
"However, I do expect a mystery thriller to keep me interested for at least a couple of hours.",0
"Well, The Street Lawyer  disappointed me.",0
"The novel evolves around Michael Brock, a workhaholic attorney and rising star at the prestigious law firm of Sweeney and Drake, whose life was forever changed when a homeless man took him and a couple other lawyers hostage at the office.",0
The intruder was shot dead but the incident led Brock to major soul searching after which he decided to leave his promising career to become a public interest attorney.,0
"Along the way, Brock discovered that his firm was involved in the wrongful eviction of the intruder and he vowed to learn the truth.",0
"Unlike many of his other novels, Grisham failed to create any suspense.",0
"There were no twists in the plot to hook a reader - by the middle of the book, the reader already knew what the ending was going to be like and there were no surprises as to how Michael Block got there.",1
The climax of the story involves lawyers meeting in a judge's chamber to discuss a settlement.,0
Exciting?,0
Not really.,1
Part of the problem may have been due to Grishams overeagerness to educate the readers about the plight of the homeless.,0
"While this is no question a noble cause, it was a significant detraction to the development of the story.",1
The subplots about the homeless characters Block encountered ended up overwhelming the main storyline.,0
I also found Block's transformation from a money-hungry associate striving to make partner in a large firm to an idealistic lawyer hoping to change the world a bit forced and somewhat unconvincing.,0
"If you are a Grisham fan, by all means read The Street Lawyer.",0
But prepare to be disappointed.,0
"It is definitely not"" The Firm"".",1
"I always used to be a loyal Grisham fan, but this book changed all that for me, and I fell I have no choice but to pan this book.",1
This book seems to be the turning moment when he simply stopped being able to write a good novel.,0
The best thing that I can say about this is that it is informative...,0
that's it!,0
"It does not even attempt to be captivating in any way like his previous books, which really hook you, or even interesting in the least.",1
You leave this book feeling as if you have just gotten out of a five hour lecture about the homeless problem in the United States.,0
This work has non of Grisham's usual suspense and thrill which have always made his books a pleasure to read.,1
"Skip it and stick to A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker, or The Runaway Jury",0
"I got this book, because it was a Grisham book that I had not read ( the only one besides The Chamber ) so far.",1
"In a nut shell, a homeless bum gets into the conference room of an upper crust law firm in D.C. and holds several lawyers hostage for several hours.",0
"While there, he tries to lay a guilt trip on the lawyers who all took home at least 6 figures last year, yet donated almost nothing to the poor.",0
"Most of them were too afraid for their lives to feel guilty, except for Michael Brock.",0
"When the ordeal is over, Michael's career takes a turn.",0
He become determined to make a difference.,0
"He and his wife are at a difficult time in their marriage, with him spending as much as 18 hrs at the office, she fills her time by going to medical school, and becomes a doctor, now neither has the time for the other--and divorce is inevitable.",0
Michael meets up with Mordecai Green a'Street Lawyer' and this inspires him to become one also.,0
A fighter for the rights of those who society has cast off.,0
"Perhaps it is because I don't agree with most of the political views of the main players of the book, but seemed that there was a bit too much whining about how the rich and the government tend to dismiss the homeless as riff-raff.",1
( this is not the place for me to get on a soap box and share my political views.. so I won't ).,1
"While doing the research for a law suit, he finds that his former firm has been more than loosely involved in illegal activity regarding the homeless.",0
He decides to take on the world ( not unlike in Rudy from the Rainmaker ),1
"Over all, it appears that the deadline to get this year's Grisham book came a bit quick for John, either that, or he was specifically looking for a movie contract for this story, either way, it was not his best work--but it still held my attention through the whole book",1
"Ah, if only good writers could stay at the top of their game forever...unfortunately, this isn't the case and it's always sad to see one of your favorite authors turn out a lackluster book that seemed to be written with a lack of regard for his readers' intelligence as well as hastily written and poorly edited.",1
"This is the case with James Patterson's latest Alex Cross thriller, Violets Are Blue.",0
The Premise,0
Alex Cross is back as a D.C. detective who again pairs up with the FBI to help solve a series of horrific murders that appear to have been committed by vampires.,0
"As he works on the case, he continues to be stalked by his old nemesis The Mastermind.",0
"Along the way, he meets up with yet another pretty detective who he begins to fall for, leaves his family in the lurch again and again, and does pretty much everything he's been doing in the past novels.",0
The Pros,0
The book is written in traditional Patterson style of no frills.,1
"The chapters are only two or three pages apiece, the sentences are short and to the point.",0
Readers will likely breeze through this one in a day or two.,0
"If this weren't the case, I have a feeling that many readers would have given up before the end due to boredom, frustration or the maddening feeling of' What the hell is Patterson thinking when he wrote this?' while they read.",1
The Cons,0
I couldn't help it with this book--I ripped it apart.,1
"I actually kept a piece of paper with me as I read because I found so many flaws, each one nettling me so much that I had to write it down so as not to forget it in my review.",1
This book is not well-written.,1
"Although Patterson got away with his completely plot-driven books before because the plot was so good, this plot stumbles along and leaves you looking at the writing.",0
"In chapters that are written from Cross's point of view, he uses stupid little lines ( that Cross is saying to himself ) like"" Oh, no Kyle!",1
"God no!"" and""Kyle, Kyle have mercy on us"".",1
His descriptions of people are borderline ridiculous.,0
"After describing one character, a supposed vampire's, appearance, he adds the stupid line,"" He was dark and dangerous looking.""",0
"Another is described as,"" The most sinister looking man I had ever seen.""",0
And he has an unnerving habit of hammering into our skulls that pretty women are pretty.,0
"Every time one woman comes into the storyline, he has to mention something about her looks, even though he's already described her as beautiful.",0
"It would be okay if it was well-done, but it's not.",1
"The lines, like"" She looked at me and she had such beautiful eyes"" made me cringe.",0
"This is the writing of a complete amateur, not someone who is at the top of his game, as Patterson should be by now.",1
2. The book is full of inconsistencies or muddy areas.,0
"For example, a character is identified as Arthur, and is then called Brody a few pages later.",0
"This is similar to something I found upsetting in Roses Are Red: there are at least four characters named Betsey, including a major character.",0
"When I first started reading it, I thought that it was a pattern and would be explained.",0
Nope.,1
Apparently he just liked the name Betsey or kept forgetting he'd already used it.,0
This is a product of bad editing.,0
"Come on, James, you're rollin' in the dough!",0
Hire a professional editor!,0
I'd be available for next to nothing!,0
3. He takes a few jabs at his children that made me mad.,0
"Damon and Jannie have never been described as anything but angelic, but in this book he refers to them as'the little creeps' and says Jannie'can be good when she tries'.",1
Huh?,0
"I think anyone would kill to have such well-behaved, sweet children, as Cross always has seemed to think in the past.",0
It doesn't make any sense!,1
"4. The things Cross does, we've seen book after book and it's getting very tiresome and irritating.",0
He always gets matched up with an attractive woman in law enforcement ( how many of these can there be?!,0
I don't think I've ever seen any in real life! ) who he starts falling for.,1
"He's always saying he needs to stay home more often, then runs off for days on end on another case, leaving his family high and dry.",0
"This is especially irritating in this book because The Mastermind is threatening his family throughout, yet he keeps leaving to pursue this case and leaves them alone with their 80-year-old grandmother and no other protection!",1
"When the Mastermind calls and again threatens them, he acts as if he's forgotten they were in danger and calls in his trusty buddy Sampson, who rushes over and watches out for them.",0
"Come on, Cross, your kids' mother was violently murdered, you're all they have left and you're taking off when they're in danger and endangering yourself?",0
"I've always liked Cross's character in the past, but he got on my nerves here.",0
5. The plot.,0
"There is the dual plot of The Mastermind and the vampire killings, the last of which is solved with a'who cares?' near the end of the book to concentrate on The Mastermind.",0
The dual plot isn't interwoven enough to make it work.,1
"Plus, where Patterson usually writes believably about investigations, this one has some very unbelievable leaps of faith.",0
"Cross finds that some magicians are performing in the areas that the murders were committed, and, from that alone, they brand them the killers and are able to get a huge FBI team to follow them.",0
Hmmm...a little more evidence would be good here!,0
I was saving the best ( and by best I mean most maddening ) thing for last.,0
"In the end of Roses Are Red, The Mastermind is revealed for who he is.",0
"In Violets Are Blue, we go throughout the entire book with him still being called The Mastermind as if we'd never been informed of his identity!",1
The author drops clues to his identity which are completely and utterly ridiculous because WE ALREADY KNOW WHO HE IS!! What was he thinking here?,0
Did he forget we knew who it was?,0
"He seems to be insulting our intelligence by bringing him back in as an unknown, thinking we're not smart enough to remember that we already solved this little mystery in the last book!",1
Ugh!,0
"To make matter worse, he's revealed in dramatic fashion like we're supposed to say,"" OH!",0
"My goodness, who would have guessed?""",0
"Of course, we're not surprised and Cross doesn't seem too surprised either.",1
"Considering this is the plot that he runs with in the end, it's very disappointing.",0
"Now that I'm done ranting and raving ( believe me, I could have done more but I restrained myself ), would I recommend this book?",0
"Well, if you're an Alex Cross follower, you might as well read it because you're probably already hooked ( as I am ) and will want to read the next one ( which there almost certainly will be--why not if he can get away with marketing this amateurish crap and still stay on the bestseller list? ).",1
"However, if you can get out now, do it.",0
Patterson seems to be going down the toilet and bringing his faithful fans along with him.,0
Wow. Stephen King trying to write a fantasy.,0
"That's like Britney Spears trying to rap, or Backstreet Boys trying to write a good song.",0
"It's just not going to happen A medicore fantasy would be the best of his ability, but of course there would be bloody killing.",1
Basic fact of life: I don't like the author.,1
"I despise Stephen King, so if you love him, as in you would be offended if anything bad was said about your author, then I suggest stopping here.",0
"I mean, he's not even that good, and he's got all these terrible best selling novels, I'll just say that he struck it rich with the"" thrills and chills"" crowd that likes their children to read R.L. Stine.",1
"Nothing against those folks, but I just don't see the big deal about this guy.",1
Hes no Ray Bradbury.,1
He just cant reach into different genres.,1
Here's the basic rundown:,0
The Characters,0
"King Roland--a king that is basically like"" I'll do whatever the evil wizard tells me to do.""",0
"Typical moron in these types of novels, not very well developed in the time he is in the book, which is not really that much, but still...hes your typical king with a death wish.",1
Peter--The ONLY well-developed character in the book.,0
"I hated his guts, of course ( if he existed, I would.",0
"Unfortunatly, he has no guts to hate, so I guess it was a bad choice of words ).",1
"Naturally, hes the good looking good guy that you know will always win at the end, but you just dont know how.",1
"The first son of King Rolands, hes destined to be the Prince, but of course the exact same evil plot to stop that from happening happens, just as in any copycat novel.",0
Sigh.,0
"Thomas the choo choo train--Okay, just Thomas.",0
I have to say I despised this character also.,0
"The second son of King Roland, hes always overlooked.",0
"Of course, with his birth, the Queen Sasha died, so the first thought is that he is the bad guy.",0
"Thats partially true, actually.",0
"Anyway, his tragic birth was made possible in part by the evil wizard, Flagg, giving Roland an overdose of crack.",0
"( Okay, maybe not crack, but the same kind of stuff.",1
Green vodka.,0
"I dont know, but it s probably illegal in all forty nine states.",1
"California is going to fall off and sink into the ocean, so Ill count them off now ).",0
The evil wizard Flagg--GASP!,0
"Your typical, demon wizard set to take over the world.",0
"Need I say more, because I dont really want to.",1
Dennis the menace--also known as Dennis the Butler.,0
"He finds the dead body of a rat, and that s basically his huge involvement in the book.",0
Unless you would rather me spoil the ending?,1
The Plot,0
"Cough....cough....uh, let's see.",0
"A fat little king named King Roland was not a bad, dictator king, but a good hearted king.",1
"A good heart, we soon learn, does not help you much in life when you are trying to be the oh-so powerful king of this little land.",1
"His main advisor, whispering his every move into his ear, is a black cloaked wizard named Flagg who is sooo unsuspectable when he gives King Roland this green gunk and we later find out his wifes been killed by it.",0
Such a nice guy.,0
What an unpredictable plot.,0
Yippie doo!,0
"Anyway, after deciding Thomas looked sexier than Peter, he decided to frame Peter for killing daddy.",0
"He shows Thomas an eyehole, where you can peek through the eyes of a dead dragons head, through the wall, to spy on dada.",0
"Anyway, after King Roland flashing the dragon while Thomas is looking through the eyehole, Thomas decides to go back (you horny man, you ).",0
"Anyway, he sees Fragg giving Roland an evil drink, and Fragg devises a clever(? ) plot...poison Roland and poison a rat with the same stuff ( it makes smoke come out of your ears and it makes your body suddenly go up in a green fire, maybe you ve heard of it.",0
I heard listening to the Backstreet Boys may cause it ).,0
"Anyway, put the dead rat in Peters room behind a bookshelf, and let Dennis find it.",0
"Typical, typical, typical.",0
I do not like this plot.,1
Do you?,0
Getting bored yet?,0
The Authors Writing Skills,0
Lets just say that if you are looking for a corny piece of writing that would have gotten a C in sixth grade English class...then I highly recommend this book.,0
"I have nothing against King, I just think he should nt be selling these vulnerable pieces of cr@p that wont matter in three months, while these great writers never get their fair share of the pie.",1
Its always like that is nt it?,0
"Even on Epinions, sometimes it s one of the worst reviews ever...and it s on the top of the list because",0
a)People dont care,1
b)( S)he got easy raters,0
"c )he got highly recommended by an advisor, or",0
d )he is an advisor.,0
"Now, Im not giving out names, but I will say that I have read advisor opinions that arent worth cleaning the toilet with.",1
"Thats life, and as much as I hate it, it s got to happen.",0
"How come the game Final Fantasy VIII sold millions of copies when it s the most boring game Ive ever played, and Monster Rancher 2 pretty much barely made it past the price they paid to make it and it s a wonderful game?",0
"How come Mystery Men basically bombed, when the terrible movie Scream 3 was a big hit?",0
"Its just an unfair world out there is nt it, Charlie?",0
Thats how it is with Stephen Kings writing ability.,0
"Hes got nothing, and yet every other book becomes a movie.",0
Its not justice.,1
Overall,0
Just pass on this one.,0
"Im not sure if you liked Pet Cemetary or whatever, but just pass on this shallow plot, and go get The Doomsday Book by Connie Willis for a much better plot and writing talent",0
It won't be any spoiler to the literate masses to say that this classic Gothic horror story revolves around young Doctor Victor Frankenstein and the monster that he brings to life.,1
"This unnamed creature, the culmination of years of painstaking work by Frankenstein, turns murderous after experiencing cruelty and persecution in his every encounter with humankind.",0
Mary Shelley's work was first published anonymously in 1818.,0
"Significant in its day for the distillation of Gothic literary conventions combined with an original and imaginative premise, the book is still widely known today, if not quite so widely read.",1
I was fairly surprised to find that I did not at all enjoy reading this book.,1
"In fact, I found it enormously repetitive and tedious.",0
"Despite the brevity of the story, I still thought the story dragged on, as if the author had padded the story heavily without adding anything of substance.",1
"I was also surprised to find that the story held absolutely no suspense for me, nor could I say that the story struck me in any way as"" creepy.""",1
"Sort of a disappointment for one of the most famous Gothic horror stories of all time, wouldn't you say?",0
"Adding insult to injury were the leaden dialog, a completely unsympathetic main character and the lack of credibility in the actions and thoughts of the characters.",1
Here's an example of what I mean when I say the dialog is leaden.,0
The scene is one in which a household servant of the Frankensteins has wrongfully been accused of a murder committed by the monster.,0
The excerpt is typical of all the dialog in the novel:,0
""" She is innocent, my Elizabeth,"" said I,"" and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.""",1
""" How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.""",0
She wept.,0
""" Dearest niece,"" said my father,""dry your tears.",0
"If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.'",0
#NAME?,0
"But it strains credulity to suggest that intimate family members would really converse with each other in this way, no matter the era.",1
"After endowing his creation with life, Victor Frankenstein flees his laboratory, loses track of the monster and then goes about his miserable life for two years, apparently uninterested in what has become of his life's work.",0
Is this plausible?,0
"His role during this time consists principally of languishing in nervous fever-wracked states, absolving himself of all responsibility, wallowing all the while in self-indulgent, morbid melancholy and revulsion towards the work of his own hands.",0
He waffles and dithers and generally acts like an idiot for chapters on end.,0
None of this behavior endeared him to me.,0
"In fact, the monster possesses qualities, at least at times, that are far more ennobling than any his creator ever displays.",0
"The words""miserable"" and""misery,""""gloom"" and""anguish"" appear on almost every page, sometimes in multiple paragraphs per page.",0
"If Shelley was trying to get the message across about Victor's wretched state, she might have had a little more faith in her readers' ability to absorb that message the first, second, third or fourth times around.",0
"Or barring that, she might have had recourse to a thesaurus to look for other descriptive terms.",0
"The reader is asked to not only endure, but to care about and empathize with the neurotic thoughts and behavior of Victor Frankenstein for far too long.",0
Yet another implausible aspect of the story creeps into the narrative by way of the narrator.,0
Frankenstein is actually a story within a story within a story.,0
"What that means is that Victor Frankenstein is relating his story to the captain of an exploratory vessel in the Arctic, who is in turn taking the tale down in lengthy letters to his sister.",0
"And when Frankenstein recounts the story told to him by the monster, yet another layer is added to this tissue of boredom.",0
But I digress.,0
What I found implausible here is the highly favorable impression that Victor Frankenstein - at this point a dying wreck of a man - makes upon the sea captain.,0
"In his letters, the captain speaks of Frankenstein's nobility of soul and of how he grows to love the good doctor as a brother.",0
Knowing Frankenstein through his own words left me with an altogether different impression of the man and I fail to see how the captain could be so taken with his acquaintance.,0
It has been and can be argued that Frankenstein is largely a moral tale.,0
"To reduce the moral philosophy of the tale to its essence, kind treatment makes people good; cruel treatment, revulsion and rejection makes them wicked.",0
"Yet this idea doesn't even hold up in Shelley's tale, for Victor, though raised by benevolent and loving parents treats his own creation most cruelly.",1
"And the monster, though treated most cruelly by all he encounters, retains an innate moral compass and yearning towards goodness even as he continues his annihilation of Frankenstein's friends and family.",0
Another theme that Shelley raises but does not satisfactorily treat is the idea that man's desire to master nature and to understand the world in which we live is futile without the all-too-rare qualities of self-mastery and understanding of human desires and limitations.,1
Frankenstein's fatal immaturity allowed his hubristic faith in his own abilities to overreach his wisdom and his compassion.,0
"The monster is not inherently monstrous, but becomes so through his creator's rejection of him.",1
"Had the young doctor had the wisdom to predict his own reaction to his creation or the compassion to treat it benevolently, Shelley suggests, the disaster could easily have been averted.",0
Yet this message is merely hinted at and not drawn out to any clear explication or moral.,1
It's clear that Shelley meant to play upon the parallels and contrasts between the creator and the creature in her novel.,0
Each of them is made miserable by the existence of the other.,0
Each of them seeks to master the other.,0
Both feel cut off from the world around them.,0
"And they both say of their sufferings"" I bore a hell within me.""",0
"Yet their differences are great too, for where Victor pursues science and rationality in his studies, his reactions devolve into hysterics and passivity; while the monster, who comes into existence with no learning and no one to instruct him, resorts to empirical analysis of the world and consistently acts vigorously on the basis of his analyses.",1
"In these contrasts and similarities, we can detect Mary Shelley's background as the daughter of a philosopher and the wife of a poet.",0
"Unfortunately, this after-the-fact sort of literary parsing doesn't make up for the anemic and long-winded text that Shelley left us.",1
This is the first time in my memory that I have read a classic piece of literature and found virtually nothing to commend it or repay my time and effort.,1
It surprises me that a book of such a reputation falls so far short in every way by which I am accustomed to judge fiction.,0
"Sadly, I cannot recommend this book to anyone.",1
I suspect that the book continues to be read today largely on the strength of its popularity in the era of its publication,0
I've read most of the books written by Mary Higgins Clark and have enjoyed them.,0
Before I Say Goodbye is her 22nd book and my least favorite of all of them.,0
"That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, I just felt her other novels were much more exciting and interesting.",1
I read the back cover of the book and expected something completely different than the story before me.,0
"The synopsis indicated that Nell MacDermott had lost her husband, Adam, when a bomb blew up his boat.",0
She had so many unanswered questions.,0
"When a woman approached her with psychic powers claiming to have contacted Adam in the after-life, Nell agrees to try to get the answers through this medium.",0
"This wasn't the story line at all - there was a hint at the paranormal and psychic abilities, but only a hint.",1
Maybe Clark's publicist was trying to draw in those interested in the paranormal.,0
The story was more based on Nell trying to clear Adam's name when bid rigging and construction scams are investigated by law enforcement agencies and her husband's name seems to be at the center of it all.,0
Oh and did I mention that Nell's grandfather ( who raised her ) is a retired congressman who wants his granddaughter to follow in his political footsteps?,0
"With the black cloud hanging over her dead husband, Nell's political future is very uncertain.",0
Nell goes on her on sleuthing expedition to try to get answers and ends up getting more than she bargained for and it's a race against the clock to save her.,0
"The characters are not very well described, but only vaguely outlined.",1
That's probably the biggest detriment to the book - there were so many support characters that could have made for some fantastic subplots and the opportunities were wasted.,0
"For example, Nell's Great Aunt Gert could have an entire book devoted to her whimsical character.",0
"She's fun, eclectic and loves to explore the supernatural ( didn't Mary Higgins Clark write an entire book for another support character with the same fun characteristics?",1
"Yep, remember The Lottery Winner? ).",0
"Maybe the future will hold a book on Great Aunt Gert, which should be fun to read.",0
"Before I Say Goodbye is an average book, but definitely not on the top of Mary Higgins Clark's list of great books.",0
"Before I Say Goodbye leaves you wanting more - more character description, more in-depth plot, more subplots, more everything!",0
"I'd suggest it only if you've read all of her other books, but until then, leave it on the library shelf!",0
Dean Koontz is one of my favorite horror/sci fi writers.,0
"In the past, his books have been very easy to read and the stories believable enough to fall in love with the book.",0
I was given The House of Thunder as a gift and eagerly began reading over a rainy weekend.,0
"Even though, the book jacket says that is was written by Dean Koontz, this book seemed to lack Dean's usual flair.",1
The Beginning,0
The story begins with a young woman-Susan-awakening in a hospital bed.,0
"She has been in a coma for so long that she does not remember her name, her job, or what caused her to be in the hospital in the first place.",1
It is up to the dr. to tell her a little about herself; that she was a physicist at a drug company.,0
"With the dr's help, Susan begins remembering bits and pieces about her past.",0
"She does not remember the car accident that has placed her in the hospital, though.",1
"Although Susan can not remember important details like what her job was like, or the sound of her boss's voice, she does remember one important fact that carries through the whole book.",1
Susan remembers the fraternity brothers who were responsible for her fiance's hazing death-and their revengeful plan to get her back.Susan was a key witness in getting one of the brothers sent to prison.,0
The Middle,0
"In the middle section of the book, Susan begins to believe that two of the frat brothers are trying to kill her.",0
She sees two orderlies who look and act like the frat boys.,0
"She tries to convince the Dr., that the orderlies are trying to kill her, after some questioning of the orderlies, it is stated that they are not trying to kill her.",1
"Susan becomes extremely afraid of the orderlies due to thier unique likeness to the frat boys and the malicious pinches, etc that they give her.",0
"At this time, the dr and nurse believe that Susan is having a mental setback because she appears to be schizophrenic in her'unjust' fear of these two orderlies.",0
The Ending,0
"At the end, Susan finds out that she is part of a Communist plot created by the KGB.",0
"The hospital and town where she is at does not exist, it is in fact just a storage facility that has been created to resemble an hospital/town.",1
"The KGB has researched Susan's life, that is how they knew what her fears were, and used these fears against her.",0
"I feel that this book was very unrealistic due to the fact that Susan was a physist, yet she was not a spy and I have no idea why the KGB would be that interested in her.",1
"If Dean had continued with the same storyline that was introduced in the beginning and the middle, the book would have been much easier to read and believe.",0
"Instead, he took a perfectly good story, slapped on a fancy ending-that did not go at all with the storyline and called it a book.",1
"I am glad this book was a gift, because I would have been disappointed if I had purchased it",0
3 dead!,0
56 wounded!,0
Film at 11!,0
"Well actually, you have until Saturday Night so there's time to run around like Sherlock Holmes on speed and solve the mystery just minutes before the news media puts your company out of business.",0
Not exactly Jurassic Park here!,1
This has to be the worst I've ever read from Michael Crichton.,0
There are 2 major problems with this book.,0
The first is Crichton's tendency to be overly technical.,0
I like a story that is based on facts.,0
And learning a little about those facts along the way can be fun.,0
But we didn't need to know the level of details presented here to appreciate the dilemma the heroin was dealing with.,1
Which brings me to the other major problem.,0
"I, for one, didn't really care about the dilemma.",1
I worried about the fate of the human race if those dinosaurs managed to escape from Jurassic park.,0
But I didn't worry that this highly skilled woman was going to lose her job ( Oh the horror of it all )!,1
"Or that a Chinese ( the new"" Evil Empire'? ) would steal an American wing design.",0
Less important but still distracting from the story is Crichton's habit of throwing his own prejudices and political beliefs into his stories.,0
Beside the'Evil Empire' we get a one sided view of the'Evil Media' and a terrifying portrait of the'Evil Union'.,0
I'm not a fan of today's media with it's'sound bites' and'shock value equals ratings' attitude.,1
But I think that the story here implies that every media person has a 100 % disregard for anything but his/her own personnel ego.,0
I find that hard to believe.,0
"I'm also not a fan of unions with mostly short term, selfish goals.",1
"But still, this story would have us believe that the union would take any opportunity to seriously injure or even kill a middle aged single Mom who has nothing to do with their actual grievances, just because she is part of management.",1
No way Mike!,0
I DO like Chrichton.,0
And there were a few riveting moments in the book.,0

The beginning of the novel starts off well.,0
He develops an intriguing character.,0

"Develops somewhat of a plot, I suppose, if you can even call it that.",0

And did I mention that the whole story takes place within the frame of ONE NIGHT!,0
Dean Koontz must be the master...the master of overwriting.,0
"It takes him forever to get through just one scene in the book, as if he's describing every unimportant minute.",0
Only one word for Koontz: BORING!!!,0
That's not the end either.,1
"He writes about 300 pages before about the final 30 or so, where he introduces a new character...a new character who is behind all of this chaos.",0
HELLO DEAN?? Couldn't you find a more suitable ending?,1
"The author did not prepare the readers for this whatsoever, and it's as if he didn't know how to end it, and so he just stuck in whatever.",1

"Kiss the Girls was OK, but there were too many unbelievable points about it that made it a bad story all together.",0
"Jack and Jill though, shows how desparate James Patterson must be to keep churning out cheap thrills in order to make a buck.",0
It also shows how repetitive his ideas are.,0

"Alex Cross is still bemoaning his fate that he is a smart accomplished Black detective in Washington D.C., working around a bunch of stupid white people.",0

"He still mourns the death of his wife Maria ( who was killed in a drive-by-shooting ), yet he falls in love with a female character that he meets ( just like in Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls)-- luckily for him in this novel, the husband of the woman he falls for gets offed.",0
( Read future Alex Cross novels! ),0
"Last, he is torn between his dedication to the job, and his devotion to his children and his"" Nana Mama"" ( his grandmother )",0
"In Jack and Jill, a mysterious murderer is out to kill President Thomas Byrnes; but for no obvious reason except that Byrnes is an outsider to politics and to Washington ( he is a former CEO of Ford or GM or something ); and he's shaking up the town with his brand of politics.",0
"Yet, no good reason exists at all, even at the end of the story, as to why someone was going out of their way to murder him.",1
"On the other hand, in the""black"" part of town, someone is killing little kids near the school where Cross' children attend.",0
No one gives a darn it seems except for Detective Cross and his friend John Sampson.,1
"So in the book Cross also bemoans the fact that he has to protect the President, when in fact he would rather be searching for the killer of the children.... it sounds throughout the novel that He blames the white guys who are his bosses for this.",0
"Now is it just me, or are these two stories completely unrelated?",0
"If you read the book's back cover it says something like,",0
""" Only Detective Alex Cross realizes that the two different murderers wear the same face"".... doesn't this mean that the same person is stalking/VBG|NN the President and then murdering these kids????",0
"That's not the case at all, if you read the book.",1
Turns out that Some Washington insiders wanted the President dead.,0
Ooooh... big conspiracy... it would be nice if James Patterson explain why.,0
And the child murderer is some nerdy kid who stopped taking his anti-depressant.,0
This second storyline seems to have been added just to add extra pages to the weak first storyline.,0
"One last thing that bothered me is that the book was written around 1996-97, during President Clinton's term in office, yet Thomas Byrnes is supposedly President in the novel ( the novel takes place in the present )......",0
".......... While talking about conspiracies involving the Whitehouse, James Patterson mentions the Whitewater Scandal.",0
How can that be if Clinton was never the President in Patterson's story??,1
It is garbage.,0

"Unfortunately, it wasn't, and by the beginning of the third narrator, I did not feel like reader the remaining two parts.",1
Then there is the narrators themselves.,0
"Again, this could have been excellent, save the fact that 2 of the narrartors are so arrogant and full of themselves that it made it hard for me to want to keep reading it.",0
Finally there was all the historical detail.,0
"Mr. Pears obviously spent a lot of time researching to make his book as accurate as possible, including his writing style.",0
"I commend him for that, however the details he gives are so numerous that they begin to over shadow the plot.",0
If you like the history behind what each narrator does ( i.e. the development of science for Da Cola's tale ) then you will enjoy it.,0
If you find any one of the subjects offered ( say cryptography ) then it will hinder your enjoyment immensly.,0
"I did enjoy reading some of this book, namely Da Cola's tale, and the final tale, but the two tales in the middle dragged too much for me to be able to really recommend this book.",0

An author who brings up the topics of atheism and Jesus Christ should not be relegating them to one sentence.,1

What influenced Wilson to become and atheist in the first place?,0
Would Wilson have converted had he not married Jane?,0
"Don't count on Nicholas Sparks, or narrator Wilson Lewis to answer these questions.",1
"FIRST PERSON NARRATION: Thing is, most first-person narrators in all of literature are hardly shy in the end.",0

"A few days ago my husband and I crawled into bed and I decided I would start my new John Grisham book, A Painted House, before falling asleep.",0
"I am a John Grisham fan and I always rush out and buy his books as soon as they come out, it is sort of an indulgence for me to pay the price for a hard bound book but I enjoy his storytelling and since it is usually a once/year indulgence I don't mind.",1
Lying in bed I decided to annoy my husband and I began reading the book aloud.,0
I did this for about 4 minutes with him saying nothing.,0
"I then asked if I was bothering him, and he said"" Nope, just wondering how long you will keep reading to me.""",0
I took that as a challenge to continue and did so for another 5 minutes.,0
"When I stopped reading my husband laughed and said"" That is the most boring book I have ever heard"".",0
I shrugged it off since it was just the beginning.,0
I should have listened to my husband and put the book down.,0
A Painted House is not a typical legal thriller from John Grisham.,1
Instead this is the tale of Luke Chandler and his family.,0
The story takes place in the 50's and does transport you back to that era.,0
Grisham does a fine job of describing the time.,0
"However, in other areas the book just falls flat on its face.",0
"Luke Chandler lives on a cotton farm in Arkansas with his Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Grandpa in an unpainted house.",0
Each year during the cotton picking season the family goes into town and selects its help for the season.,0
"This year the family selects the Spruills, a family from the hills of Arkansas and a group of Mexicans.",0
Things are different this time around and right from the beginning the Chandlers don't seem to care for the Spruills but they need the help so they do whatever they can to keep the peace.,1
The Spruills have a son who is a rather large bully and seems to enjoy that.,0
He causes trouble on the farm as well as in town.,0
I don't want to ruin the story so I will just say that there are some things that happen and Luke seems to bear witness to all of them.,1
"This probably is because the child, he is 7, is somewhat of a voyeur.",0
"Perhaps it is the boring life on the cotton farm, but the boy just seems to enjoy sneaking around into everyone's business.",0
He sees some things that no child should see and is more or less forced to keep a series of secrets from everyone.,1
"The story starts of slowly, and when I say slowly, I mean very slowly.",0
"I don't think there is any action of excitement until around page 70, give or take a few.",1
Grisham really seems to take a lot of time setting the scene and developing the characters.,0
There are authors that neglect to do this but I felt Grisham really took too much time here.,0
I had a hard time getting into the book and at one point found myself thinking things were picking up.,0
I got a little excited that things were looking up only to find out that it really was nothing.,0
When the story does finally pick up a little bit it is only temporary.,0
Up we go and right back down.,0
I told my husband there is about 30 pages of boring and then about 3 pages of excitement.,0
I found it to be rather annoying.,0
I guess that is my major issue with this book.,0
"I knew when I purchased this book that it was not a legal thriller, but I still hoped for a little bit of mystery, there was none!",1
The ending is another thing that falls flat.,0
"There were so many different roads that this ending could have taken and although the ending was a happy one, it was also a little sad and I felt let down.",0
I am not impressed with this particular Grisham novel.,1
I feel that Grisham spent too much time on the character development and not enough time making the story exciting for the reader.,1
"His description of the 50's seems accurate and readers might enjoy the trip back in time, but that trip doesn't make the book worth reading.",1
"John Grisham, of legal thriller fame, has attempted a pastoral memoir with his recent book, A Painted House.",0
"I read the book cover to cover, enjoying it well enough in spots, but wincing in others, where Grisham just did nt seem to have the skills to convincingly carry the story.",1
"I will apologize in advance if I make any errors in this review, as the book was a library loan that I have since returned.",0
It is certainly not a book I need to own for my personal collection.,1
"Narrated by 7 year old Luke, A Painted House, is the tale of one cotton picking season for a family of Arkansas sharecroppers.",0
"Like the young boy in Grishams The Client, Luke seems much older than his years, and speaks quite unlike any 7 year old I have encountered.",0
"While Grisham constructs decent plots, Elmore Leonard need nt worry about his status as dialogue writer supreme.",1
"I was also perplexed by an early description in the book, which was used on the book jacket as well.",0
"The cotton had grown to the fathers waist, AND over Lukes head.",0
I actually took my soon-to-be 5 year old daughter to see where she stood when placed beside me.,0
Nearly to my waist.,0
"So, apparently Luke was pretty short or his dad was pretty tall.",0
"I know this is nit-picky, but if Grisham is going for memorable descriptions, using questionable details is an iffy way to start.",0
"Living with his mother and father on his grandparents  farm, young Luke shares the annual routines related to the cotton harvest.",0
"Luke watches his grandfather Pappy recruit laborers for the harvest, beginning with a family of hill people ( a nice way of saying hillbilly ), the Spruills, and migrant Mexicans.",0
"The Spruills are a ragged bunch, straight out of Steinbeck, and the Mexicans are, well, Mexicans, I guess  according to Grisham, they pick cotton without complaint, enjoy a lively game of baseball, and help paint a house.",1
"A good-natured bunch of gringos, except for the switchblade brandishing one called Cowboy.",0
"Thus begins a summer full of adventure, the likes of which I have yet to see in all of my 38 years.",0
"Luke is required to keep so many secrets, he will undoubtedly be a therapists field day in the future.",0
"The Spruills have brought along a psychotic behemoth named Hank, who murders a young punk in a fight, during a Saturday night outing into town.",0
"Luke witnesses the violence, of course, and must not talk about it for fear that all the Spruills will leave before the cotton is harvested.",1
"Also in the Spruill clan is a hot hillbilly chick, Tally ( does that rhyme with Sally or Paulie? ), who Luke lusts after in a way that seems a bit unlike a 7 year old.",0
"He watches her bathing nude in the creek, and I half-expected him to have his first sexual encounter!",0
"This is all disconcerting to the reader  while a touch of romance might have been nice for the story, Grisham made Luke 7 instead of, say, 15.",0
Fans of John Grisham will no doubt want to read this.,0
A Painted House is supposedly based on some of Grishams childhood experiences.,0
I found the book as entertaining but no better than the average movie shown on cables Lifetime channel.,1
"Here are some better titles for your summer reading list, in my humble opinion.",0
"John Grisham, consciously or unconsciously, borrowed a little flavoring from some of these better works to spice up his cotton tale.",0
"1 ) The Summer of 42, Herman Raucher.",0
My all-time favorite book.,0
"Makes you laugh, cry, and yearn for those bittersweet days of adolescent angst.",0
"2 ) Tobacco Road, Erskine Caldwell.",0
"A grotesque, yet funny, look at Southern poverty.",0
"3 ) Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck.",0
Need I say more?,0
"4 ) Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain.",0
"Magical boyhood adventures, without all the cotton-picking drudgery of Grisham.",1
"5 ) Dandelion Wine, Ray Bradbury.",0
"I read this one a long time ago, but there are scenes of an idyllic but unusual boyhood summer that I still recall.",0
"Publishing a novel is a brilliant thing, and something I dream of doing one day.",0
"But, as with any form of art, when you experience the masters ( the above 5 ), it makes the Grishams of the world seem less spectacular.",0
"I get the feeling from Grisham, Clark, King and others, that quantity has become more important than quality.",0
Ill take one Herman Raucher over ten John Grishams any day.,0
"Mr. John should definitely return to writing about dealings with shyster lawyers, big money, crooked cops, righteous do-gooders, bad folks and such.",0
"I have read all his books and found them fascinating, interesting, engrossing and makes me hate to put the book down.",0
And they made even better movies.,0
"A Painted House would be a good movie to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, when you're snowed in and need some-thing to make you feel warm.",0
"Unfortunately, the book does not do much more.",1
"Mr. Grisham does capture the essence of a hot, sweltering life picking cotton, and the slow easy living in the 50's in a small southern town.",0
It's no Little House on the Prairie!,1
"Luke, the narrator, gives me the feeling he is 7 going on 22.",0
"Of course, that's probably because the diction of these hard working, poorly educated sodbusters is not written so as to be really"" twangy"".",1
"Luke introduces"" Pappy, my grandfather,..."" Instead of something like"" Pappy, my grandpaw.."" and goes on to muse over the fact that the pay for the hired hands""played heavily on his mind as we rode to town.""",0
A child of 7 would think in those terms?,0
"There's Pappy and Gran, my mother, and my father.",0
"Not the more familiar,"" Momma"", when the subject of the moment, and the father is seldom mentioned in depth.",1
"Everything is sort of"" touched upon"".",0
There's no feeling of being real about these people.,1
"Except, of course, for the female interest that show's up in the person of Tally, a seventeen year old beauty ( a member of the Hill people's group ).",0
Now how much can develop between a 7 year old boy and 17 year old girl.,0
"Fortunately, not much.",1
I have struggled to page 187 ( out of 292 ) and may save this book for next winter.,0
Or next summer at the lake when there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do.,0
"Yesterday, I went to the library ( getting smart in my old age!! ) and signed out"" Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire"".",0
I think I'd better check it out before buying it.,0
Now that's another story!! Pardon the pun.,0
To think I paid for three books thru the book club and all three have been less that entertaining.,0
"In fact, I read them just because I had them on the headboard of the bed.",0
Those reviews are next!!!,0
Recently I have been very interested in reading fiction books.,0
"Don't ask me why, sometimes the desire just strikes me to read, so I do it.",1
": ) The first book I read was David Baldacci's"" Wish You Well"" ( a great book by the way ), then John Grisham's"" A Painted House"".",0
The cover of this book has beautiful colors.,0
The sunset in the cotton fields is reflected off of nearly every boll of cotton on the left hand side.,0
"On the right hand side, there is a larger shady area where the sun is not shining.",0
This may be slightly symbolic and revealing about the book's plot ( if you use logical deduction and reasoning ).,0
"To me, the shade in this cotton field represents the many dark secrets held throughout.",0
"Each little boll of cotton could be one secret, with the whole field turning out to be hundreds and hundreds of well-kept secrets.",0
This book is set in the early 1950's on the cottonfields of Arkansas.,0
What else can I say about the plot?,0
"Well, one thing's for sure, it takes a HELL of a lot of time to get to the plot.",0
I had to read about 50 pages before I could find out just exactly what the point was.,0
"Once I got there, I discovered that an innocent boy by the name of Luke Chandler was the main character.",0
"In the early stages of the book, Luke and his father ( or grandfather, I can't remember ) go out and look for workers to pick the cotton.",1
They look for Mexicans in particular since they are more likely to work for lower wages.,0
"In any case, the beginning stages of the book were like walking in waist-high mud.",0
"It was boring, tedious, and dull.",0
"I felt like I had to force myself to enjoy the book at this point, which should NEVER be done while reading.",1
The only one funny point I remember at the beginning of the book were Luke's observances of how his grandfather always drove his truck at EXACTLY 37 miles per hour.,0
"Interesting, and I did chuckle a few times.",0
But chuckling was rare in this book.,0
"Finally, after going through Hades, I get to some interesting points.",0
"Luke meets a woman by the name of"" Tally"" who he is at least a little attracted to.",0
Luke also meets many other people ( mostly people who were hired by his grandfather to work the cottonfields ) who either befriend him or show hostility.,0
I don't wish to reveal much else about the plot because I don't think it is worth mentioning.,1
It's as simple as this.,0
Luke Chandler is a seven year old boy who encounters new people on the cotton farm who either like him or don't like him.,1
"Regardless of whether they like him or not, Luke is forced to keep many secrets the workers have told him or made evident to him.",1
"The rest of the story drags on, there are a few murders here and there, with rarely a laugh, if none at all.",0
"The bottom line is this: If you're used to John Grisham's court justice books, DON'T read this one.",1
It's way off-topic compared to his others.,0
"If you are interested in a story from the 1950's and cottonfields and the hostility between workers, then you may want to pick this up.",0
"I find that the story is just too dull for me, though, and that's why I'm giving it a 2 stars out of 5.",0
"I bought and read"" A Painted House"" as soon as it came out as I do with all John Grisham books.",0
I was interested to read how he treated a story that did not revolve around a legal case.,1
"He did not treat it well, and I will not buy another one of his books unless it is a legal thriller like his others.",1
The setting of the story seemed interesting enough--a rural Arkansas farming town during the Korean War.,0
The story takes place over the length of a cotton-picking season.,0
"It is an observation of the picking season as told by a seven year old son of a sharecropper, Luke.",0
"Luke's character is very well developed, and his is the only character that is.",0
"There are many other characters in the story, but the reader is never given enough information to really care about them.",1
"The weak character definition made for a long and boring read, as I really didn't care what became of most of the characters in the story.",1
The book was a very long read.,0
The one redeeming quality was that it was very descriptive.,0
I had clear visuals of what the characters and the town looked like.,0
"The descriptive nature of the story, however, was not enough to make this an interesting story.",1
I am not even going to talk about the plot because I really don't see a point.,1
"To paraphrase Nike,"" Just Skip It!""",0
I am a long time Grisham fan.,0
"Since the Firm, through Pelican Brief, The Rain Maker, the Chamber ( highly recommend it ), but this is simply not his best work.",1
It is too predictable and political in a way.,0
"Young attorney avoids death in a confrontation with a homeless man and eventually goes to work for"" the people.""",0
It is necessary in the mean time for him to realize the error of his ways for having taken a big bucks career in a law firm when he was needed elsewhere.,0
"Not to preach capitalism to you, but he might have found a way to keep his job, give monetary as well as legal assistance to the poor, and everyone is better off.",0
"No, it is necessary to give up every financial benefit in order to cleanse your soul of the corruption incumbent upon money.",0
Did I mention that this is not my favorite Grisham novel?,0
"If you are into a preachy novel, you might just enjoy it.",0
Happy reading.,0
There are two authors I've looked forward to reading when they have a new book out--Tom Clancy and John Grisham.,0
"After A Time to Kill, The Firm.",0
"The Pelican Brief, The Client, and to a lesser extent The Chamber, I was ready for the next from Grisham.",0
So of course I spent the money for the hardback version of The Street Lawyer as soon as I could find it.,0
"As usual, I read the first few chapters with great anticipation.",0
"But somehow, the interest never developed.",0
It took me some time to figure out what the problem was.,0
Maybe the main character wasn't developed enough?,1
"No, not that.",1
Maybe it was the situation that didn't ring true?,1
"Not that, either.",1
The problem was simple--the plot.,0
There was nothing engaging about it.,1
"It dragged on, and began to take on the character of a reformer's sermon.",0
The whole book may have been Grisham's charity cause.,0
"As it turned out, I only got halfway through the book.",0
"I'm not one who likes to put that much time into a book without a payoff, but in this case I decided to cut my losses.",1
I just don't think it was worth the time to finish.,1
And you know what?,0
I have no desire to find out what happened!,0
And I haven't considered investing money or time in his next book.,1
I read this book and I think if was wonderful.,0
I don't know why you wouldn't read this...,1
It is fantastic.,0
This storie is about a little boy from the mid-evil times.,0
He witnesses his fathers murder.,0
"The way Stephen King writes this book, is just fantastic.",0
It is like you are really there.,0
"I started to read this book, I couldn't put it down.",1
Not unless I had to go to school or to bed.,1
I recommend this book to many people and I think that if you are reading this you should go out and buy it.,0
I was told to read this book by my mother and as soon as I started it I just couldn't stop reading it.,1
If I could read this book again I would read it.,0
I hope you go out and get the book.... it is fantastic.,0
I think I said that but I just thought that you should know that it is fantastic,0
"Murder, Mutants, Abuse, Torture, Doctors, Scientists, Secrets, Gun Shots, Betrayal, Sex, Love.... these are just some of what you'll find in James Patterson's book, When the Wind Blows.",0
General Information,0
When the Wind Blows is written by author James Patterson.,0
"It was published in 1998 by Little, Brown And Company.",0
"The hard cover version that I read had a total of 416 pages and unlike the other two books I've read by Patterson, I could actually find places where I could force myself to stop reading for the night.",0
I've only recently started reading books he's written and confess that I'm already a huge fan.,0
ISBN: 0-316-69332-4,0
The Story,0
"Dr. Frances O'Neill, a well loved vet in Colorado, was working as usual in her place of business - the Inn Patient.",0
"Frannie as she's called by her friends, has had her share of heart break and loss.",0
"Her husband David, a doctor at the local hospital was murdered less than 2 years earlier.",0
Frannie is a real softy which is what many of her clients and their owners loved about her.,0
"So there she was, minding her own business when one day this gorgeous hunk of man walks in and rents her cabin [which is being the Inn Patient].",0
His name is Kit Harrison and while she can't stand him and at the same time she can't help but like him - just a little.,1
It takes quite awhile for Frannie to find out but Kit is not who she thinks he is.,0
"Then, Frannie's good friends husband is killed.",0
"They say it was an accident, that he hit his head in the pool; but it's very hard for those who knew him to believe.",0
"After much crying and several drinks, Frannie drives back home to the Inn Patient where she not only works, but has lived ever since David's death.",1
On her drive home she thinks she sees something.,0
She stops the car.,0
Wait.,0
What is that?,0
Oh my God!,0
It looks like a human girl.,0
A beautiful little human girl - no more than 12 years old.,1
But she has wings... and oh my God!,0
She can fly!,0
Frannie tries to gain her composure and then resumes the drive home.,0
By the time she reaches the Inn Patient she's convinced herself that she couldn't have really seen a girl with wings.,1
It just wasn't possible.,1
It must have been the alcohol...... right?,0
That's all I'll give you for the story.,0
"Sorry, but if I give you more than that I just may ruin the book for you.",0
That's how Patterson writes.,0
And in case you're wondering all of this happens in the first few chapters of the book!,0
About the writing,0
"Like every other book I've read by Patterson, When the Wind Blows was thrilling and very hard to put down - making it very easy to read.",0
Patterson captivates the reader from page one and if you think you'll find a stopping place at the end of a chapter - think again!,0
"Unlike the last book I read by Patterson Cradle and All, I was actually able to put down When the Wind Blows so I could get some sleep.",0
It wasn't easy but I did manage.,1
In the beginning of the book is an Author's Note.,0
"In this note, Patterson states that what he writes in When the Wind Blows is much closer to the truth than even he thought it would be.",0
"While in part, I have a hard time believing that - there's a part of me that knows there must be some truth to the matter.",0
Overall,0
"If you're looking for an exciting book of fiction and science and doctors interest you, I recommend you give When the Wind Blows a try.",0
"There are some graphic parts which made me mad to read, but I don't believe it would be too much for anyone to handle.",1
Thanks for reading ~,0
Melissa,0
The first thing I liked about this book before reading it was the print size.,0
The print is large enough to read without getting eye strain.,1
This book is about children who have been altered through gene combining.The children are raised in a school that is like a military lab controlled compound.,0
All of the children have the unique ability to fly but are discouraged from using this power.,0
But this is just the basis on which the book is written.,0
The real theme of the book is about love and trust.,0
"There is your man meets woman, but the two people who are thrown together in many thrilling situations fight this attraction.",0
Later on they give into their feelings and open up to each other.,0
"They find out they have been betrayed by friends, co-workers and even the government.",0
Tom aka Kit Harrison is a FBI agent who has lost a wife and two little boys in a plane crash.,0
He is sent on a vacation because he is being overly interested in a case and won't go with the conventional ways of investigation.,1
In other words he is an agent who is obsessed with a case and won't give up.,1
But the real reason is that he is getting to close to discovering what the agency wants to keep a secret.,0
This is the gene altered children.,0
Frannie is a veterinarian that rents the cabin to Kit.,0
Frannie is the widow of David.,0
David's death is one of the deaths in the case that Kit is investigating.,0
They get off to a rocky start but soon fall for each other even though they resist the feelings that they have for each other.,0
Fannie sees Max in the woods one night.,0
Max is one of the altered children.,0
She and her brother Matthew escaped the compound by flying over the fence.,0
Max has learned to not trust anyone especially adults who have done nothing but tell her lies all of her eleven years.,1
Kit and Fannie eventually make friends with Max.,0
This where the action starts.,0
Kit and Fannie find out where the children are kept and make a daring rescue and then run into other thrilling adventures.,0
Later on after the rescues and drama the children are united with their birth parents.,0
This book has all that anyone could want.,0
It is action packed with murder and mystery.,0
Love and romance bloom.,0
The ending is as it should be.,0
A closure with tears and good feelings.,0
"People find books every day that they'll invariably describe to friends as"" something I can't put down"".",1
Usually the books that hold my attention in that manner are those that can make me laugh - or truly think.,0
"My mother has a love for both the murder-mystery and Science-fiction genres, and when she handed me a worn copy of The Genesis Code by John Case I read the back of it with mild interest.",0
"Things came up, other books seemed more interesting, and now a year-and-a-half later I've just finished reading it - and it was something I couldn't put down.",1
The story seems simple enough from the beginning - a priest in a small Italian town takes a ghastly confession from a local doctor.,0
"Upon hearing the confession he drops everything, closes up his church and high-tails it for the Vatican to relate this unholy confession to his'superiors'.",0
"Fast forward, and skip across'the pond' to Washington D.C. where Kathy Lassiter and her son Brandon are brutally murdered - then ritually burned.",0
The murderer ( an Italian gentleman ) is burned badly from the fire and is taken into custody.,0
Kathy's brother just happens to own one of the top investigative firms in the world.,0
"Joe Lassiter, is consumed with a feeling of helplessness and a desire for revenge.",0
Mostly he just wants to get to the bottom of who - and why - someone would murder his innocent sister and her little boy.,0
"He puts to use all his contacts ( and an endless pool of monetary resources ) ranging from upper level government officials, local detectives, Swiss bank presidents, etc. to get to the bottom of the mystery.",0
As Joe goes deeper and deeper into the investigation - traveling from place to place in Europe - he finds that other women and their young sons are being brutally murdered in the same exact manner.,0
But why?,0
"And with the killer of Kathy and Brandon still in a hospital, by whom?",0
"The reader is aware that somehow this all ties back into both the Catholic Church, the priest and the doctor from the beginning of the novel.",0
"However, he/she won't figure out all of the intricacies of the mystery until the last couple of pages - when the book comes to an incredible and fiery conclusion.",1
"The author, John Case is one of the freshest voices I've read in quite a while.",0
"At first, even with the horrible events that transpire in his life, you won't be completely sympathetic towards Joe.",1
It's a credit to Case that he can turn his readers' opinions around in such a short time.,0
"Joe had me talking aloud, and scrunching my mouth from side to side whenever he was in danger, or about to make a stupid decision.",0
Case's style is splendid.,0
"Growing up on Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels, I was transported into a world of dry, lifeless facts and numbers.",0
The characters were all stuffy politicians and members of the military.,0
What makes Clancy's voice so mesmerizing is his acute knowledge of the subjects he writes about.,0
Case is able to do this without being dry - at all.,1
Perhaps its because he too knows what he's talking about.,0
"The mini-bio found in the insert tells the reader that"" John Case is the pseudonym of an award-winning investigative reporter and the author of two non-fiction books about the U.S. Intelligence community  he is the proprietor of a company that specializes in international investigations for law firms and labor unions""",0
"Case is descriptive, but in a humanistic manner.",0
Reading The Genesis Code is more like being told a story than it is staring at print in a book.,0
"A representative snippet from the first quarter of the novel is a good example:"" As he waited, listening to the phone ring in Rome, he watched the sun slide into the Mediterranean like a woman entering her bath, gently breaking the surface of the water and, ever so slowly, disappearing beneath it"".",0
"The story is amazing, the ideas and final resolution will make you think for days after you put the book down.",0
It's one of those stories that you will not soon forget.,1
If you're looking for a book that you can immerse yourself in this is the one.,0
"Check out John Case, and I promise you won't be disappointed.",1
Have you ever distractedly picked up a paperback at random at a railway station or an airport with the intention of idling away some hours with reading not even certain that you will finish the book?,1
"Have you ever been brought up short by a story so breathtaking in its subject, scope and pace that you have nt been able to put it down?",1
This was my introduction to John Cases first novel.,0
"The priest's musing was interrupted by a familiar noise from the other side of the partition--the sound of a curtain pushed aside, followed by the grunt of an old man sinking to his knees.",0
Father Azetti composed himself and opened the grille with a brush of his hand.,0
""" Bless me, Father, for I have sinned..",0
"The priest listened, and the word burst from him in a gasp:"" What!?""",0
"Dr. Baresi repeated what he'd said, speaking in a hushed and urgent voice.",0
"And then he began to elaborate, so that there could be no mistake about what was being said.",0
"Listening to the terrible and persuasive details, Father Azetti felt his heart lurch in his chest.",0
"What the man had done--what he'd committed--was the most spectacular sin imaginable, a sin so deep and terminal that heaven itself might never recover from it.",0
Was it even possible?,0
  CHAPTER 1,0
So begins The Genesis Code.,0
"It is a fast paced, edge of the seat thriller.",0
The plot remains well hidden through innumerable twists and turns and comes to a stunning and unexpected climax.,0
I was very close to the final chapters before I realised the full magnitude of the scenario that was being presented to me.,0
There are a few holes  in the plot ( why does nt the baddy just shoot the goody in stead of talking at him and then letting him escape? ) but these seem irrelevant as the roller coaster ride across two continents charges along.,1
"The hero, Joe Lassiter, is the head of an investigative agency.",0
When his sister and nephew die in a house blaze he joins the investigation.,0
"Over the next 437 pages, he becomes increasingly ensnared in a world populated with assassins, medical experimentation, secret societies, arson, the church hierarchy, myth and mysticism, and multiple murder.",0
John Case is the pseudonym for an investigative journalist.,0
Much of the background content has been explored in meticulous detail.,0
"I would not wish to give away anymore of the plot but regardless of your beliefs, convictions and persuasions, this is one book that will challenge them all.",1
"I would agree with the quotes of the cover from Norman Mailer ( [It ] is one of the few science-mysteries I have read that is impeccable in plot, immaculate in story resolution and moves with high skill from locale to locale and from suspense to suspense ) and Stanley Pottinger ( A week after I finished reading it, I still woke up at three in the morning wondering: What If? ).",0
I completed the story six months ago and I too still wonder ,0
This is the best book I have read for many a year.,0
"A Painted House is not so much a novel, or even so much an attempt by John Grisham to write the Great American Novel, as it is a memory picture, a long last look at a childhood in the rural South in the 1950's.",1
"A Painted House is lovingly narrated by young Luke Chandler, age 7, as he looks back across the span of years at the eventful harvest season of 1952 in Black Oak, Arkansas.",0
The initial problem confronted by Luke Chandler and his family is one of economics.,0
"With the good economic times we've had in this decade, we've forgotten that economics is usually described as a""dismal science"", and dismal is one word that describes the fortunes of the Chandler family farm.",0
The situation is so simple that the seven-year-old is easily able to grasp it.,0
Family patriarch Eli Chandler has taken out his annual crop loan to pay for the cost of renting the land and running the farm through the growing season.,0
"Come harvest time, all eighty acres of the cotton crop must be harvested and taken to the cotton gin.",0
The cotton is the lifeblood of the farm.,0
"If it rots in the fields, if floodwaters shoud wash it away, if the cotton brokers up in the sinful city of Memphis conspire to lower prices, the Chandler family faces mounting debts.",0
"Even if there is a bumper crop of cotton, that'll tend to lower prices and yield less income.",0
"And if, somehow, the harvest is a success, it will only mean a few more luxuries, and the chance to do it all over again next spring.",0
"This may make the novel sound grim, which is not the case.",0
"The economic realities of cotton farming primarily serve to highlight the social realities of cotton farming, which the novel addresses from its first sentence.",0
"Even with the best good will in the world, Luke and his parents and grandparents would never be able to pick 80 acres of cotton by themselves.",1
"Work must be hired in order for the harvest to come in successfully, and in northeastern Arkansas, that means""hill people"" and Mexican migrant laborers.",0
"The South has always had a class structure, enough so that one wonders if Karl Marx wasn't really born in South Carolina and wasn't fooling those folks over in Europe.",1
"The Chandlers are somewhere in the middle; as Southern Baptist tenant farmers, they're below the Methodist shopkeepers in town and above their sharecropper neighbors.",0
"( We don't meet any African-Americans until later in the book; Grisham claims that blacks were rare in that part of Arkansas, and I don't have any way to know if he's cheating. )",1
"The Pentecostal hillbillies and the Catholic Mexicans rank towards the bottom of that structure; Luke's mother feels the need to remind people from time to time that the Mexicans are human beings, too.",0
"( In case you're wondering, the people at the very bottom of Southern class structure are Yankees, and people who root for the baseball Yankees aren't much higher on the list. )",1
But it would be wrong to characterize A Painted House as a story of class struggle.,0
The conflict between the hill people and the Mexicans is just one of a mosaic of conflicts that the novel lovingly illustrates.,0
"Grisham shows us the divisions within the Chandler family itself; shows us the endless quiet turf battles between Luke's mother and grandmother over the kitchen and garden, the long twilight struggle of Luke's grandmother against her ornery husband, and the problems left behind by Luke's hellraising Uncle Ricky before he went off to war in Korea.",0
Even the title represents an intergenerational conflict between those who want the Chandler's house to be painted for the first time and those who don't see the need.,1
"On top of those conflicts, Grisham presents the ancient divisions between town and farm, between man and weather, between boys and girls, between innocence and experience, between North and South, between the Cubs and the Cardinals.",0
( It is to Grisham's credit that Stan Musial and Harry Caray are characters as important as any other in the novel. ),0
"The conflicts that Grisham creates are all fairly obvious from the start, all the more so because the characters in the novel are close to being stereotypical.",0
( The Claude Rains Principle applies here; stereotypical characters in a John Grisham novel?,0
"I'm shocked, shocked. )",0
The nice thing about A Painted House is that it presents and resolves these conflicts in such a leisurely manner.,0
"Far from being a thriller, A Painted House moves at a slow, unhurried pace that is entirely appropriate to the subject matter.",0
"In meteorological terms, although Grisham sets off the odd tornado here and there, the real tension builds up like slow-moving floodwaters rising in a valley.",0
"What moves the novel along, surprisingly, is not so much the Grisham talent for storytelling but an evocative, almost lyrical style and a stunning talent for observation and recollection.",0
"Luke Chandler doesn't have much dialogue in the novel -- in fact, most of the story involves him keeping his mouth shut -- but his descriptions of life in rural Arkansas are wonderfully detailed and insightful.",1
"Details such as the acts at the town carnival, the Chandler patriarch's theory on the proper speed to drive a pickup truck, the types of ice cream available at the Baptist church picnic, and a thousand other little gems are one of the reasons that the novel sparkles.",0
"Here's Grisham on a small, but telling subject:",0
My worst chore of the late afternoon was in the garden...,0
"It was on the east side of our home, the quiet side, away from the kitchen door and the barnyard and the chicken coop.",0
Away from Pappy's pickup and the small dirt drive where the rare visitor parked.,0
"It was enclosed in a wire fence four feet tall, built by my father under my mother's direction, and designed to keep out deer and varmints.",0
"Corn was planted around the fence so that once you closed the rickety gate with the leather latch, you stepped into a secret world hidden by the stalks.",0
My job was to take a straw basket and follow my mother around as she gathered whatever she deemed ripe.,0
"She had a basket, too, and slowly filled it with tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, peppers, onions and eggplant.",0
"She talked quietly, not necessarily to me, but to the garden in general.",1
""" Look at the corn, would you?",0
"We'll eat those next week.""",0
""" Yes ma'am....""",0
My mother loved this little plot of soil because it was hers -- no one else really wanted it.,1
She treated it like a sanctuary.,0
"When the house got crowded, I could always find her in the garden, talking to the vegetables.",0
Harsh words were rare in our family.,0
"When it happened, I knew my mother would disappear into her refuge.",0
"I thought very highly of A Painted House, unfortunately, I am unsure that my appreciation of the novel will necessarily be shared by everyone.",0
The biggest attraction that A Painted House had for me was that it allowed me to draw parallels between my own childhood experience and that of the protagonist.,0
"I didn't grow up picking cotton, thank goodness, but I did grow up poor and Southern Baptist in Mansfield, Texas.",1
"I was the son of a preacher man, and we lived on the parsonage of New Hope Baptist Church in 1974, with a big garden where my mother grew okra.",0
My father preached every Sunday and spent the rest of the week working in a scrap metal yard to make ends meet.,0
"We didn't live there very long, and ended up moving into a house trailer on the extreme fringes of Dallas County, where my father pastored another struggling Baptist church before he left the pulpit for a teaching career.",1
"I remember all of that, remember what it was like growing up in a trailer park, and how it felt to move into a real house of our own for the first time.",0
"And I thought about my great-grandfather, the first Curtis Edmonds, who was born in Alabama almost 120 years ago, and who assuredly did pick cotton there, and on a dirt farm near Milford, Texas, and on another farm in Archer County.",0
I thought about what he would think of where I live and what I do for a living.,0
"And I thought about my little nephew, and the advantages that he has, and will have, and how alien and far away the world that Grisham describes will seem to him when he grows up.",0
"I hope that he will read A Painted House, and think about it.",0
"You wont find any lawyers or courtrooms in John Grishams newest novel, A Painted House.",1
"No sireebob, this is a horse (or, house ) of a different color.",1
"It seems the attorney-turned-publishing commodity has reached the point in his career where the annual publication of an automatically-bestselling legal thriller is, perhaps, getting a bit old-hat.",0
"What we need here, folks, is something completely different to revive routine bloodsomething like, oh I dunno, a coming-of-age tale told by the seven-year-old son of an Arkansas cotton farmer; something without legal eagles; something with only sporadic thrills; something to show the world that even though Grisham writes airplane-ride fiction, he secretly pines to be accepted as a serious literary author.",1
Its a risky move.,0
"Most members of the Rocket-Propelled Bestsellers Club ( Tom Clancy, Stephen King, Sue Grafton, et al ) rarely stray far from the well-cropped pastures of their established genres.",0
"Even when King goes legit ( Different Seasons, Hearts in Atlantis ), there remain shades of darkness and monsters.",0
"So, you ve got to admire a fellow like Grisham who tosses the dice with a book like A Painted House.",0
Will he disappoint long-time fans expecting more Southern-fried justice?,0
Will he recruit readers who would nt ordinarily pick up a paperback where the words # 1 Bestseller  dominate half the front cover?,1
Will Clancy decide to jump in the fray by writing a bodice-ripping romance?,0
Only time ( and a blitz of hype from Grishams publisher ) will tell.,0
I should mention that Ive never read any of Mr. Grishams other books ( not even on long airplane trips ).,1
Im only familiar with his works by way of Hollywood ( ranging from the horrid A Time to Kill to the excellent The Rainmaker ).,0
"So, while I cant tell you how A Painted House compares to The Brethren, Im happy to report it s a cotton-pickin good read on its own merits.",1
"It will never reach solid gold classic status like Harper Lees To Kill a Mockingbird, but it does bring to life a time, a place and a set of characters who burn bright in your mindat least until you turn the final page and move on to the next book waiting patiently on your bedside table.",1
"A Painted House is the story of a single harvesting season in the autumn of 1952 when the Cardinals are trailing the Dodgers by five games ( baseball, that easy nostalgia tool of writers, figures prominently ).",0
"The narrator is pint-sized Luke Chandler, the only son of Jesse and Kathleen and grandson to Pappy and Gran.",0
"One other significant family member, Lukes Uncle Ricky, is away on the front lines of the Korean Wara constant fret-and-worry for the whole family.",0
"Theyre a close, patriarchal family who enjoy the rewards of hard work followed by Sunday dinners and listening to Harry Caray announce ball games on nighttime radio.",0
"From the start, I realized A Painted House has the down-home goodness of The Waltons and contains as many of that shows gentle pleasures.",0
It also has a fair share of flat-footed prose and corny sentiment.,0
"The characters have the depth of an RC Cola bottle ( half-drunk, no less ) and they move in ways weve all seen before.",0
"But yet, gosh durn it, I found myself getting caught up in their simple life and its many predicaments.",0
The story opens as Pappy hires migrant workersMexicans and hill peopleto pick the crop on the struggling farm.,0
No single event defines the plot.,1
"Instead, A Painted House has many rooms, a series of life bookmarks  for young Luke.",0
"The episodic nature of the novel is due to the fact it was first serialized in Oxford American, the bi-monthly magazine the author publishes.",0
"In the space of six weeks and 400 pages, Luke witnesses two murders, a childbirth, a tornado, a flood, his first nekkid girl and his first televised baseball game.",0
Land sakes!,0
"At thirty-seven, I realize Ive led a pretty dull life by comparison.",0
"Grisham does cram a lot of coming-of-age-isms  into this young boys life and the tone occasionally adopts a too-sophisticated veneer, but it s all in the name of easy-to-read fiction.",0
"Dont come expecting Great Literature on the order of that other  Oxford, Mississippi scribe, William Faulkner, and you wont be disappointed.",1
"On the other hand, if youre thinking this is going to be just another annual Grisham event, you might be pleasantly surprisedkind of like how you felt that moment you saw your first nekkid girl.",0
""" A Painted House"" is the newest book by my favorite author, John Grisham.",0
"As soon as his books hit the stands, I have to buy them.",0
"Even if I am in the middle of reading another book, that book gets set aside so I can read his newest work of art.",0
"While this book is totally different than any other book he has written to date, it did not disappoint me at all.",1
"I have read some ( few ) reviews that didn't rate this book kindly, but I felt very differently.",1
"While I have loved every one of Grisham's books, sometimes I have felt that they were so detailed and technically mind-boggling with legal mumbo-jumbo.",0
This one is the perfect change of pace from that.,0
"The setting is Arkansas, late summer of 1952.",0
"Luke Chandler is a 7 year old boy who is an only child, living with his parents in his paternal grandparents home on their cotton farm.",0
They are very poor farm folk and every member of the family has to work hard to bring in the precious cotton crop; something they plan for and depend on all year long.,0
"Luke's grandfather ("" Pappy"" to Luke ), is a spirited man who doesn't tolerate nonsense.",1
I get a kick out of the way he insists that his old truck must not be driven over 37 mph.,0
He worries constantly about the weather and how it will affect their crops.,0
"When it's picking time, Pappy goes to town to hire Mexicans who have arrived in a trailer, all scrunched up worse than cattle.",0
He hires 10 of them to work the cotton fields.,0
On the same day he also hires the Spruill family.,0
"Families who live in the Ozarks and are referred to as"" The hill people"" come down to be hired on to the cotton farms for the season.",0
"The story takes us through the short season and all the ups and downs this poor family goes through trying not to get rich from their labors, but just to break even so they can farm another year.",1
"This has some meaning to me because my Dad is a farmer and although times are different now than they were 50-60 years ago, we knew plenty of years where there was barely enough to scrape by and feed 5 kids.",0
It's amazing how resourceful one can be when the situation requires it.,0
"Along with the Spruill family comes their 17 year old daughter, Tally.",0
"Luke at the age of 7 has yet to discover much about women, but is very curious about Tally.",0
He thinks that a 10 year age difference isn't too much.,1
Hank Spruill is the oldest Spruill boy and he is mean.,0
He gets into fights and is even involved in the death of one the boys from another farm.,0
The youngest Spruill member is a young boy named Trot.,0
Trot is not'right' as he has some physical disabilities.,1
( This was before the days of political correctness. ),0
Trot would play a key role in the story as to how the book got it's name.,0
Along with the Mexicans comes a boy named Cowboy.,0
He too is a mean person and he and Hank have their moment late in the book.,0
Luke doesn't like Cowboy much because there is a little too much interest between Cowboy and Tally.,1
"This book has reality, humor, scandal, sorrow and sentiment.",0
It is written through the eyes of a seven year old boy and how he views the world.,0
"While there are parts in the book that are disturbing because there is death or financial tragedy, I found the book to be light hearted and often funny.",0
Grisham had a way of making Luke's character quite interesting; very inquisitive and hugely imaginitive was young Luke.,0
"If I had to choose something that I would have liked to be different about the book, I think, as others have mentioned, that I would have liked to know more at the end of the book, such as what happens to the family.",0
"But then, this book can't go on forever.",1
"All things considered, I think the author chose an appropriate place to end the book.",0
I have been a John Grisham fan since 1989 when his hit A Time To Kill was released.,0
Grisham was a master of courtroom drama.,0
"For some reason, probably due to publisher deadlines, I have nt been as thrilled with Grishams latest works.",1
"This February, A Painted House was set to be released.",0
"Much to my dismay, I hear it is not a legal thriller, but rather a fictionalized childhood memoir.",1
"There will not be one lawyer, one judge, or even a courtroom in Grishams latest novel!!",1
"Of course, hearing it is not a usual Grisham does nt stop me from getting my own copy.",1
I have no problem with Grisham trying to branch out into other genres.,1
"Just because he is a great legal thriller author, does nt mean he cant try to be great at something else.",1
"As soon as I get my copy from the Literary Guild, it is opened and I begin to read.",0
"I have to admit, I was not expecting such a wonderful change of pace from the usual Grisham-style.",1
"A Painted House is about a seven-year-old boy, Luke Chandler, and his family.",0
"Luke is the narrator of the story, so you see everything through a childs eyes.",0
The story is set back in 1952 in Arkansas.,0
There is a cotton crop to be picked and Lukes family hires hill people  and Mexicans to come to their farm and pick the cotton along with the Chandler family.,0
The Spruills ( the hill people  hired by the Chandlers ) and the Mexicans bring excitement and controversy to the Chandler farm for young Luke.,0
"Hank Spruill is a large fellow and with him knowing this, he is able to get himself into some trouble.",0
The local sheriff wants him on a murder charge for killing a local troublemaker in a fight.,0
"However, the sheriff is willing to let him stay on the Chandler farm until the cotton is picked to help the Chandlers out during the pickin season.",0
Luke is terrified of the large Hank Spruill.,0
"On the other hand, Hanks sister, Tally, a seventeen-year-old girl, has Lukes eye.",0
To Luke ten years in age difference is nothing.,1
Tally could love him.,0
Tally gives Luke the thrill of a seven-year-olds life.,0
"Course, I am not going to tell you what it isbut, I have to admit I was laughing during this segment of the book.",1
The Spruills and the Mexicans on the Chandler farm do not get along.,1
"One of the Mexicans, Cowboy, is a rough one too.",0
Cowboy and Hank are rivals and neither one thinks the other can take him on.,1
Luke sees all the problems on the farm among the people.,0
"He is a highly intelligent seven-year-old, in my opinion.",0
"Course, since I know nothing of 1952, maybe kids were smarter then.",0
I dont know any seven-year-olds who know the amount of information Luke Chandler does in this book.,1
Luke Chandler seems to understand just about everything the adults say around him.,0
Nothing seems to get past young Luke.,1
Luke loves baseball and would love to spend his cotton earnings on a new Cardinals jacket from the Sears catalog.,0
"He would be the envy of every kid in the town of Black Oak, even surrounding towns for that matter.",0
"In fact, Lukes dream is to leave the farm ( as his mother wishes ) and play for the St. Louis Cardinals when he gets older.",0
"Overall, the book mainly concentrates on the problems around the farm with the cotton crop.",0
"It seems that everything, and I mean everything, surrounds the picking of the cotton this season.",0
The Chandler men are concerned with the crop.,0
The women just try to get along and make it through and listen the men complain all the time.,0
"Basically, it all borders down to money.",0
I hate to tell anything else about the story because I dont want to reveal too much.,1
"There has to be some mystery to the novel before you start reading it, otherwise what would be the point?",0
"For example, the title of the book itself, I cannot explain to you.",0
It is an important aspect of the story that you need to discover for yourself.,0
My viewpoint on this novel: I feel that overall the book was a wonderful change of pace for Grisham.,0
"Personally, I have been disappointed a little more each time I read his new releases.",0
"My problem is that I compare every one of his novels with his first release, A Time To Kill.",0
"Nothing compares!!! Some have come close to that greatness, but not many.",1
I enjoyed this novel and Grisham even had me laughing at one point in time with Tally and Luke as I mentioned above.,0
The biggest disappointment would have to be the end of the novel.,0
It leaves the reader drawing a blank and wanting to know what else happens to the family.,0
"Personally, I feel that Grisham may have done this for a sequel maybe at some point in time.",0
"He may not have intended to write a sequel, but if enough of his fans love this style, maybe he will write a follow-up novel to the Chandler family.",0
Who knows?,0
This is just my opinion.,0
"If you are looking for a nice change of pace, pick up A Painted House and enjoy.",0
I personally feel this is one of Grishams best in a very long time.,0
I must start out by saying I have never read a John Grisham novel until now...gasp.,1
"I've watched the movies, but never read any of the books.",1
"A novel without all the lawyer intrigue appealed to me, so I gave Grisham a shot.",1
"He truly does know how to tell a story, but this one needed something more.",0
The novel takes place in the rural cotton farming country of Arkansas in the 1950's.,0
Little Luke Chandler and his family struggle through another tough picking season with their hired hands.,0
"The rest of the Chandler family includes Luke's mother and father ( who secretly want more from life than farming ), Luke's pappy and grandmother ( who could never think of doing anything but farming ) and Luke's uncle Ricky ( who is off fighting the war in Korea instead of starting trouble in his hometown ).",0
Luke is a bright 7 year old boy that dreams of escaping his life on the farm to become a baseball player for the St. Louis Cardinals.,0
"He is devastated when the new hired hill people, the Spruill's, set up camp very rudely on his baseball diamond.",0
Luke's baseball diamond is not the only thing the family ends up ruining.,1
"A group of hard-working Mexican migrant works also moved to the farm, where one bad apple spoils their bunch.",0
"I don't want to give anything away, but a dangerous man in each of these two groups start alot of trouble on the farm and in town.",1
Trouble that ends in death and destruction.,0
The other big point of intrigue in town revolves around a very poor share-cropping family called the Lathchers that live nearby the Chandlers.,0
"The Latchers have a full house of shoeless hungry children that Luke's kind mother takes food to on a regular basis since it is the"" Christian thing to do.""",0
"When the eldest Lathcher daughter, Libby, is rumored to be pregnant, the ladies in the Baptist church society put Luke's mother up to the task of finding out if the rumor is true and who the father is.",0
"After many trips to the Latcher shack, Luke's mother and grandmother are asked to help deliver Libby's baby.",0
The birth not only rocks the lives of the Lathcher's but the Chandler's as well.,1
The two families are forced to come together when a shocking secret is revealed.,0
"As for the title of the book, it revolves around a rather small portion of the story and is hard to quite understand the significance of it all.",0
"The youngest Spruill child, Trot, who is handicapped in some way takes a liking to Luke's family and begins painting their unpainted home ( this is not a give away, it is made very clear in the book and is no mystery ).",0
"The symbolism of this act is rather hard to get to the bottom of, but makes for a cute side story and helps end the novel...if you want to call it an ending.",0
The ending truly leaves you hanging and it's not in a good way.,1
"I wasn't left wanting more, I just felt cheated by how it all ended.",1
"I was made to care about a few of the characters in the novel, but was not allowed to know what happened to them.",1
"At times there is much repetition in this novel, especially when it comes to the cotton picking scenes.",0
"I just wanted to tell Grisham that I get it already, they're picking cotton, it's hot and it's hard work.",0
For several chapters he uses the same wording to describe different days in the field where the same things happen.,0
It just felt like dead space.,0
"The intrigue that involves murder, illegitament children and strange house painting is intersting, but I never felt on the edge of my seat.",1
My major complaint about these aspects of the novel is that there was never any real mystery involved.,1
The answers were handed to me instead of me searching for them.,0
"Instead of giving choices of who killed who or who the baby's daddy was, they were made obvious.",0
"I don't like when writers hold back important information, but I felt like it didn't need to be all laid out so plainly.",1
Especially with reading a Grisham novel I expected more mystery and intrigue.,0
I also felt at times that he wrote Luke a little too intelligent and resourceful for his age.,0
"I just don't believe that a 7 year old boy in rural Arkansas circa 1952 could really have some of the thoughts, feelings and actions that he did.",1
Yet the novel was still an enjoyable read and took me to a time and place I had never really thought about before.,1
"The characters are well plotted out and the dialouge is written well, there are just some unbelievable moments.",0
"It's worth a read, though, so give it a try.",0
I could not put this book down.,1
"I bought this book before heading out on a 2 day bus trip back to one of the states I grew up part of my life in, grand Montana!",0
It took 2 days to get there and I really dislike Greyhound and if it were not for the cheap ticket price I would never take it anywhere.,1
I knew the trip would be scenic but there would be times that I wanted to get away from it all and settle into a good novel.,0
"Well, this one did more than let me settle... I took me by the""tie"" and jerked me under!",0
"I just could not stop reading it, the plot of all his books are the best of almost any writer out there.",1
He and Michael Chrichton are among the best I have ever read.,0
This book was about a lawyer who worked in a firm as a litigator and was around the most defiant and high up men there were in the city.,0
"He had it all, money, car, a beautiful wife, till one day a homeless man came and crashed it all in front of his eyes.",0
It goes from his high life to one of the lower society where he becomes a street lawyer after being fired from his job at the large firm.,0
And goes from there into a suspensful plot and great writing techniques conjure up all kinds of a perfectly attuned story.,0
"This writer knows his business, he can take you from fear, to trust and back again in the blink of an eye.",0
"I have never been able to stay in a book so long since the Hardy Boys, haha!",1
"If you're up for a good read that will have you constantly wanting more and getting it sooner or later, than heres your author and heres your book.",0
Go grab one from the local newstand now...you will not be un-satisfied!,1
"Tell em the most avid John Grisham reader in the USA told you to come, and they will know what to get you:",0
"First of all let me say that I am a die hard Grisham fan and I am a Mississippian, but I have to tell you that I was very disappointed in this book to begin with.",0
It is very far removed from most of JG's work and I was not prepared for it!,1
"The story - seeming almost autobiographical - focuses on a seven year old boy"" Luke"" and his family the"" Chandlers.""",0
Luke was born and raised in the cotton fields and at seven years old he picks almost a hundred pounds of cotton a day.,0
Farming the Delta is not an easy thing and we learn through this tale that even a good harvest can be doomed!,1
The passages were very descriptive and interesting for the most part.,0
"In the story, Luke is witness to racial tension, the birth of his illegitimate cousin, the murder of a local bully ( out behind the cotton gin ) and the murder of a field hand.",0
"There are no court room scenes as he never tells anyone but his grandfather what he has witnessed and Grandpappy deems it"" their little secret.""",1
Life in the Delta was tough and the passages are nostalgic in the descriptions of sitting on the porch in the evening heat listening to the ball games and dreaming of being a Cardinal Baseball player one day.,0
Lukes mother dreams of a better life for her and her family and I hope that they got it - and I would have appreciated finding out - but the ending is rather open and leaves many questions...like what happened to Uncle Ricky - did he make it back from the war?,0
Did he give his child his name?,0
"Did Luke and his family find the"" good life"" after they moved north and did he ever get that Cardinals jacket????",0
"It is an interesting book if you can look at it with out expecting the Grisham""law and order"" style.",0
"But given the content, this is one I would have gotten at the library instead of spending the money for the hard back for my Grisham collection.",0
"I am a slow reader, but compared to my husband, I'm a veritable Speedy Gonazalez.",0
"He starts a book and, if he's really interested, he finishes it three weeks later.",0
"So when he finished reading The Da Vinci code in three days, I was impressed.",0
""" I couldn't help it!""",0
my husband said.,0
""" It just sucks you in.",0
"I started and before I knew it, I was halfway done.",0
"You should read it!""",0
I was surprised.,0
"While my husband is fully supportive of my book habit, he rarely goes down the""you should read it"" path when it comes to his books that he likes.",0
His attempt to get me to appreciate Tom Clancy ended in loud snores on my part.,0
The covers of his many sci fi books all seem pretty much the same to me.,0
"And I am rarely tempted to snatch one of the books off his"" to read"" pile and sneak it into my own.",0
"In fact, with the exception of some classics from Tolkein and C. S. Lewis and a few others, we very rarely swap books.",0
I know him and his tastes ( and he mine ) well enough to know that he wouldn't insist that I read the book unless he really believed I would like it.,0
Got to hand it to the man.,0
Thirteen years of marriage haven't been lost on him.,1
He was right!,0
The Da Vinci Code starts off with a bang.,0
"Jacques Sauniere, curator of the Louvre Museum, is trying desperately to escape his attacker.",0
"Grabbing a painting off the wall, Sauniere trips the security gates, which close behind him.",0
"Still, his attacker catches him anyway and shoots him through the gaps in the gate.",0
"Sauniere knows that he is dying, and he knows that he alone holds an important secret that has been passed down through generations.",0
"So in what he knows are his last minutes of life, he finds a way to leave clues to the secret for the one person that he knows can be trusted with it.",0
"The chief suspect in Sauniere's murder is American symbologist Robert Langdon, who is in Paris to give some lectures at the American University in Paris and who was scheduled to meet Sauniere that evening.",0
"Agent Sophie Nevue, a cryptologist for the Paris police, is unconvinced of his guilt.",0
"Together, they flee from the police interrogation and start to decipher the clues to discover why Sauniere was killed and to figure out Sauniere's secret.",0
"They are pursued by an overzealous police captain, the albino monk, a scheming bishop, and a mysterious man known only as"" the Teacher"".",0
"As my husband pointed out, the story moves along at a fast pace.",0
The chapters are short ( sometimes less than a page ).,0
Author Dan Brown rarely deviates from the mystery.,0
"There is no flowery dialog, and time isn't wasted trying to establish a hot relationship between the two lead characters.",1
"Since the storyline covers a period of less than 24 hours, there really isn't much time for that romantic schlock.",1
But that's OK.,0
It's far more believable without it!,1
"The Da Vinci Code is what my husband calls"" a geek book"" or, to be more exact,"" a geek mystery.""",0
"Rather than relying on conventional clues ( like footprints in the flowerbed, lipstick on the collar, and fingerprints on the wine glass ), the mystery follows a trail of riddles and symbols.",0
Many of these riddles are based in history and are encrypted using a variety of techniques.,0
Mathematicians are sure to love this book!,0
I enjoyed it because many of the clues involved two of my favorite subjects: art history and theology.,0
"According to a one-page intro, The Da Vinci Code involves actual groups and historical events.",0
"The Catholic Church, which has enough public embarrassments to make it a viable topic for any mystery novel, and Opus Dei, which received much attention due to FBI spy Robert Hanssen, figure prominently into the plot.",0
"Toss in lots of talk about the Priory of Sion and Leonardo da Vinci's use of symbolism in his art, and you have a conspiracy theorist's wet dream.",0
This leads to my one caution about this book.,0
The Da Vinci Code presents some alternative interpretations of religious history and involves paganism.,0
Ultra-conservative Christians ( or those who aren't secure in what they believe ) may want to steer clear of this one.,1
"Since I finished The Da Vinci Code, I've discovered that this isn't the first Dan Brown novel in which Robert Langdon has appeared, nor will it be the last.",1
"Langdon first appeared in Angels and Demons ( 2001 ), and Brown plans to write more books with Langdon in them.",0
Lucky for us geeks!,0
The Da Vinci Code really is a terrific book.,0
"While I figured out some of the clues before the characters in the book did, I was still surprised and fascinated throughout the book.",0
Take my advice.,0
"Heck, take my husband's!",0
Read it!.,0
"Airport books  those novels purchased in desperation by bored, cranky travelers seeking distraction from delayed planes  get a bad rap.",0
"Oh, sure, there are plenty of trashy romances and Chicken-Soupy self-help guides on offer in airport bookstores, but on the whole, the selection is nt bad.",1
"When I have time to kill between flights, I like to wander through and browse (usually leaving a trail of knocked-over displays in the wake of my rolling suitcase ).",0
"One of the books Id see over and over again was The Da Vinci Code, and each time I saw it, it piqued my curiosity a bit more; but invariably, by the time I got home, Id forgotten all about it.",0
"Finally, a friend loaned it to me, and although Id intended it as an in-flight read for an upcoming trip, I could nt resist starting early.",1
"Robert Langdon, an expert in religious symbology lecturing in Paris, does nt exactly live a life of danger; he works the lecture circuit, writes scholarly books, and keeps his nose buried in ancient tomes.",1
So it s something of a surprise when the police come banging down his hotel-room door.,0
"Jacques Sauniere, a curator at the Louvre, has been shot to death in one of the museum galleries; in his last moments, he used his own blood and a marking pen to arrange his body in a bizarre tableau, complete with a coded message.",0
Langdon has ostensibly been called upon in a professional capacity to help solve the mystery.,0
"But Agent Sophie Neveu, a police cryptanalyst, reveals the truth: Saunieres dying message included Langdons name, and the police are about to wrongfully arrest him as the killer.",0
"Neveu believes in Langdons innocence, and she has a special reason for wanting to find the real murderer: Sauniere was Neveus estranged grandfather.",0
"On the run from the police, Neveu and Langdon follow a trail of puzzles and clues to find the truth behind Saunieres murder, and the knowledge he died to protect  information that reaches back through the centuries to a secret society, an artistic genius, and a priceless historical artifact.",0
"Ive always liked books that invite the reader to solve puzzles along with the characters, and Code has them in spades: anagrams, numerical cyphers, riddles, and secret scripts ( at one point, a character offhandedly comments that at least 62 other words can be made using the letters of the word PLANETS, and I had to stop reading and try it out for myself ).",0
The puzzles range in difficulty from Instantly Obvious to Unsolvable Without Being Fluent In Greek.,0
"Theres also plenty of historical information, which is integrated smoothly into the prose; remarkably, even when inserted into dialogue, the explanatory asides dont interrupt the flow.",1
"Brown ensures that readers who are unfamiliar with religious iconography and cyphers have all the necessary information to fully enjoy the story, without leaving advanced readers feeling bored or patronized.",1
"Even if you know all this stuff already, the authors concise recaps are interesting and, as far as I can tell, well-researched and factually accurate.",0
"Brown s writing is clean, precise, and detached, conveying information efficiently and minimizing its narrative presence in the story.",0
"The plot is appropriately full of twists and turns, with plenty of cliff-hanging action and a highly satisfying resolution, although some of the inventions seem a bit much ( not only must there be a self-mutilating monk/assassin, but he must be an albino self-mutilating monk/assassin to boot ).",1
"The character development is pretty much what youd expect from an action-packed thriller  which is to say, minimal, unless it provides an excuse for more ass-kicking adventure.",0
"The focus is upon the ingenious puzzles-within-puzzles that Brown has devised, rather than the characters who try to solve them; for this type of story, that s not a problem, although it does limit the book to entertainment rather than literature.",1
"A fast-paced, suspenseful, and surprisingly intelligent thriller, The Da Vinci Code deserves its good reputation.",0
"Its fascinating, action-packed, and itll do more to stimulate your mind than an overpriced mocha at the Terminal B coffee cart.",0
"If youre ready to let your powers of deduction take flight, give this first-class airport book a try.",0
"Although I purchased The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown almost two months ago, I just got around to reading it last week.",0
"I would have liked to have read it sooner, but unfortunately I had""prior commitments"" ranging from work-related projects to Harry Potter.",0
I became interested in the book after reading the book flap which made the plot seem like it was about the exploits of this secret club made up of the intellectual heavyweights from the last five hundred years.,0
"While my initial assessment was not totally off, I was both surprised and pleased to find out what the book was actually about.",1
"The book contained so many plot twists and spoilers, but I will try my best not to ruin anything.",1
"The plot centers around Robert Langdon, a professor of symbology at Harvard who is in Paris to deliver a lecture.",0
"As the story begins, Langdon is summoned to the Louvre during the dead of night to see a rather peculiar sight.",0
"One of the curators, Jacques Saunire, has been found murdered; not only has he been found dead, but the manner in which he was found is also peculiar.",1
"Immediately, Langdon must evaluate his role in the murder because it quickly becomes apparent that Saunire left behind clues to help Langdon.",0
"Langdon is aided in his quest by Sophie Neveu, a young cryptologist who has an interesting connection to the case.",0
"You might be wondering what this""quest"" entails and you might be surprised to find that Langdon and Neveu are not out to find",1
Saunire's murderer.,0
"As it turns out, that is the least of their problems.",0
"Instead, Langdon and Neveu must follow the clues that Saunire left before he died and embark on what can be best described as a scavenger hunt.",0
"Their work is complicated by the fact that they have the police chasing them and they are racing against Saunire's murderer, an albino monk named Silas, a member of Opus Dei ( which is a prelature of the Catholic Church ) who has been sent to recover the same thing that Saunire was trying to protect.",0
It seems that Saunire was a member of the Priory of Sion and it is up to Langdon and Neveu to find whatever it is the Priory is hiding before Silas does.,0
They will have to use their skills to follow the clues that have been left for them and look for help from the few they can trust in a crazy race against a mad monk.,0
"If the plot sounds complicated, I can assure you that it is.",0
"However, one must keep in mind that I just summarized a 450 page book in one paragraph.",0
"The reader starts out not knowing anything and slowly, over the course of the book, more and more is revealed.",0
"As the story progresses, it forks off into three distinct storylines.",0
"The first follows the perspective Langdon and Neveu on their quest, the second follows Silas the albino monk and the third follows Bishop Aringarosa, an Opus Dei bishop who is traveling to the Vatican and seems to be giving Silas his orders.",0
"I found it a little frustrating to have these three storylines - every time something good was about to happen with one storyline, the chapter would end and the perspective would switch.",0
This didn't make me like the story any less nor did I find it hard to follow - the frustration I felt stemmed from wanting to know what came next!,1
"Although it seems that nothing makes sense, things slowly begin to come together.",0
"In addition to providing a first-rate action-adventure/mystery, Brown also introduces a series of fascinating theories about everything from art to history to religion and how all three are related.",0
"While I must point out that very few ( if any ) of these theories are original, their appearance in the book serves as really great plot twists and Brown has woven a fascinating story.",0
"Because many of these theories are treated as plot twists, I don't want to give too much away.",1
"I know that I personally was shocked and fascinated by many of these theories and if I had known about them in advance, I don't think they would have had the same effect.",1
"Of course, I would also like to pique your interest, so here goes: before the patriarchic religions appeared, goddess worship played a large role in religion but this dissipated over the years.",0
Or did it?,0
What if the Priory of Sion was devoted to goddess worship and had control over the secret of the most powerful relic in the history of Christianityand that's just the beginning.,0
"Frankly, the book flap doesn't do the book justice.",1
This is much more than just a book; it is an experience.,0
"If you are a fan of art history or history or conspiracy theories or fictional mysteries, then Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is for you.",0
This book is very hard to put down but it is well worth reading.,0
You will not be disappointed.,1
I have recently discovered that Brown has written another book that features Robert Langdon.,0
You can bet your bottom dollar that that book is at the top of my reading pile.,0
I highly recommend The Da Vinci Code.,0
"The curator of the Louvre is murdered in his museum and leaves a cryptic message that appears to point to Robert Langdon, a symbologist from Harvard, as the culprit.",0
The police question Langdon pretending to need his expertise but really hoping to catch him in a lie.,0
"In jumps Sophie Neveu, a police code breaker who warns Langdon of his danger and forces him into an escape from the museum.",0
"Turns out, Sophie is the murdered curators granddaughter.",0
She knows Langdon is innocent and needs his help to crack the messages left to her by her grandfather.,0
"What follows is a bizarre romp through Paris and England as the unlikely pair elude the police, a vicious albino monk, and the true puppet-master who orchestrated it all.",0
The Da Vinci Code is a classic thriller with an intellectual bent.,0
Fact and fiction are woven into such a tight pattern of conspiracy that it becomes difficult to see where one ends and the other begins.,0
"It had me running to my art books with some astonishment, and the history generally rang true.",0
The first chapter is immediately engrossing and hooks the reader from the very first sentence.,0
The rest of the story fails somewhat to live up to the potential offered in that first chapter.,0
"The plot follows a rather traditional pattern in the modern thriller, and though it has been done again and again ( if you are around writers for any length of time you will discover that there are no original plots ), the perspective offered in the tale is fresh enough to be thoroughly enjoyable.",0
There are good reasons this novel is on the bestseller list.,0
There are a few things that detracted from this story.,0
The first was Brown s over-reliance on two constructs of the fiction writer.,0
"When he needed to get across a lot of background information ( and there is an enormous amount of it ), he did one of two things.",0
He either had Langdon flashback to a lecture he gave in a class somewhere (yawn ) or he had two or more characters discuss the issue to death.,0
Fiction writers often refer to this as maid and butler talk  because it s like the maid and the butler discussing the going s on of the family when they both know the going s on.,0
It is about as thrilling as watching paint dry.,0
The other thing that was a disappointment was when the author withheld information from the reader.,0
I presume this was to create tension; all it managed to do was create aggravation.,0
"For instance, why keep the secret ritual in the basement that had Sophie so upset from the reader?",0
He kept that from us until near the end.,0
The characters also needed some help.,0
"With the exception of the albino monk and the police chief, the characters were too good for their own good, and failed to react in a believable manner to the situation.",0
"No one had a nervous breakdown, no tempers flared.",0
"If it was me being interrogated by the police and someone barged in, took the bug the police planted in my jacket and tossed it into a moving truck thereby making it look like I was running, a fugitive, and therefore guilty, I think I might be just a little peeved.",0
"However, the layout of the story, the imminent danger they kept finding themselves in, and the amusing aspect of the puzzles carried the book.",0
I am looking forward to more from Dan Brown.,0
Enjoy.,0
I saw The Da Vinci Code advertised on my local television station and I had to give it a try.,0
"It is, without a doubt, the best book I have read in at least two years, and DEFINITELY the best book out right now.",1
"The novel focuses on Langdon, a Harvard Symbology professor, who has traveled to France in order to receive an award or attend a conference or something ( I honestly don't remember what brought him to France ).",1
He called on by the French police in order to give his opinion on a recent murder.,0
"The murdered also happens to be a curator for the Louvre Museum in Paris, and he also happens to be a man that Langdon was scheduled to meet with.",0
The reason behind this scheduled meeting is one of the many mysteries to be revealed as you read through the book.,0
"I don't want to give much of it away, because the book is written in several""phases.""",1
"Although the entirety of the story takes place within just over 48 hours, each phase reveals more information, and slowly the story unfolds hour by hour ( and I mean that quite literally ).",0
"The murdered man leaves behind a puzzling code, and as the reader you really find yourself pondering the code.",0
"The first code leads to a second code, and so on and so forth...and as the book progresses you find yourself trying to solve the codes, it really keeps you hooked.",0
"Once you figure out one code, suddenly you're thrown into another phase of the book, still puzzled with the mysterious happenings that you are reading about.",0
This book is wonderfully written and is so obviously well researched that I found myself amazed at the small details.,0
"They say to write what you know, and Dan Brown's knowledge of the early church, art and history really shines through in this tale.",0
"It sparks a lot of thought, and is such a good conversation piece...especially for those of us who have a lot of interest in the history of the Church and its controversies.",0
"Although the book was engaging and an overall fast read, there were a few minor"" complaints"" on my part.",0
"Many of you will feel as if the writer is underestimating his audience, in that some clues are so very obvious to the reader, you can't help but want to smack the main characters aside the head to give them a clue.",1
"Many times I found myself thinking something, and then putting it aside because it seemed bit too obvious, or even far fetched at times, then a character will pipe up with the same idea and suddenly it all clicks into place.",0
"Also, I don't recommend this book if you are looking for a novel with a lot of character development, the bulk of this book is spent on explaining events in history, theories, and describing controversial opinions on many areas...there isn't a lot of character development.",1
"In fact, I think the best developed character was the English man, a"" supporting role"" if you will.",0
"In that sense, you don't feel as if you""know"" Robert Langdon by the end of the novel.",1
"I also felt there was sort of a minor problem with an underdeveloped sub-plot ( I won't give it away, but we know what sub-plots usually involve ).",1
"Other than that, the book is definitely a must read, and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a problem reading about the controversial issues regarding the truth of the Church.",1
"If you haven't read about non-traditional Church history already, the book may actually be a slap in the face.",1
"John Grisham is one of my favorite bestselling authors, and I have read almost all his books.",0
"This one was certainly different from the rest of them in my opinion, in both good and bad ways.",0
"On the negative side, it was not as suspenseful and fast-paced as, say The Pelican Brief or The Firm or his other courtroom dramas - when I read them I could scarcely put the book down for fear that something was going to happen between the pages in my absense.",1
"However on the positive side, this book contained a much deeper message than those other books did.",0
( Which probably explains why it wasn't all about write-an-awesome-story-to-sell excitement. ),1
The story begins when a bum walks into a rich firm and holds ten attorneys - including some of the best and richest in the firm - hostage in a little room.,0
He has dynamo strapped to his body and is holding a gun.,0
He asks one lawyer to give him the facts straight of the IRS reports: how much money have each of these big-time lawyers donated to charity?,0
"By charity he doesn't mean the local symphony or the high-up charities they give money to in order to get their name mentioned, but money given directly to the poor homeless people on the street or the soup kitchens, free clinics, homes, etc. that help them out?",1
Of course the lawyer can't give a very big figure.,0
"Although no harm results from this short hostage-holding-session ( except to the bum, who is shot by a sniper outside and whose brains explode all over the lawyer who was assisting him with the figures ) and it seems like the bum was just trying to make a point instead of really hurt anyone, and although the rest of the attorneys go back to their strenous trying-to-get-on-top schedule, the laywer who was asked to tell the bum the statistics is deeply touched by this episode and wants to find out more.",0
"The lawyer's name is Michael Brock, and he becomes the main character of the story.",0
"Although he is a rising star at Drake and Sweeney, the law firm, he gives up some of his billing hours to investigate this incident.",0
This decision leads him to helping at a free clinic and donating his time at a homeless shelter.,0
"When he finds out what connection the firm has with the bum, he leaves it, and takes along with him a stolen file.",0
"From then on, he is a crook, and a street lawyer.",0
"This book wasn't only another good John Grisham tale, but a touching story of a man who realized his life had been shallow and he wanted to make a difference.",1
I recommend it with this reason.,0
"If you want a fast-paced court-room drama, read another of his books first.",0
"But if you are tired of that sort of thing but what something different and deeper, read The Street Lawyer.",0
"Janet Evanovichs series of books starring Stephanie Plum, an inept bounty hunter, was one of the most enjoyable books Ive read in a while.",0
"Things get moving right away, with everything happening to poor Stephanie.",0
"But, I found myself laughing out loud many times while reading this book.",0
Stephanie has some problems that have cropped up over and over in all the books in this series:,0
"She has too many hormones  and they make her lust after two men: Joe Morelli, the cop who shes known since childhood, and Ranger, the super sexy, dangerous and mysterious bounty hunter.",0
"Both men seem interested in her, and shes not too sure what to do about it.",1
"In this book, however, she does nt seem to get much chance to do anything, even if she wanted to.",1
Something keeps happening to her cars.,0
"The only car Stephanie can seem to keep undamaged is Big Blue, the big old boat of a car that her grandmother lets her drive when she is out of a vehicle.",0
Stephanie became a bounty hunter when she lost her job.,0
"She is absolutely not qualified, but the boss is her cousin.",1
"Usually, she gets the easy jobs.",0
"But this time, her boss wants her to go after Ranger.",0
"No dummy, Stephanie absolutely refuses, even though that means her archenemy Joyce will get the job instead.",1
Stephanie has a whole new set of problems now.,0
"First, Joyce is convinced that by following Stephanie, she will find Ranger.",0
"Some other people also think Stephanie will lead them to Ranger, and if not, she can be used as a hostage.",1
"Everywhere she goes, these men are following her.",0
She comes up with some interesting methods of ditching her followers.,0
One of the skips she is sent to bring in keeps trying to kill her.,0
"( By the way way, that s the naked guy with the plastic bag on his foot.",0
She finally had to shoot him. ),0
She has more problems with the all of her skips.,0
Stephanie also winds up with two unwanted and uninvited roommates: Grandma Mazur and a dog named Bob.,0
Grandma is one of my favorite characters.,0
She is a little old lady who just wants to have fun.,0
She has her own gun and wants to be involved in Stephanies cases.,0
Shes also on the lookout for a new boyfriend.,0
"The dog ends up in her life accidentally, when she promises to dog sit to help out a friend, and gets stuck with the dog.",0
"She cant get a good nights sleep, because either Grandma is snoring or somebody is breaking into her house and waking her up.",1
"And, of course, she just has to find at least one dead person, and be attacked at least a few times to keep things moving.",0
This book brings in two new characters who are sure to become as popular as Grandma Mazur.,0
Mooner is a bond skipper who she was sent to pick up.,0
"He keeps popping in and out of her life, and is a total stoner, dude.",0
"He shows up in the middle of the night to drop something off, having picked the lock so he would nt disturb her.",0
Dougie the Dealer is another new friend she inherits through Mooner.,0
"No, Dougie does not deal drugs ( except Metamucil ), but he does deal in everything else.",1
"He helps Stephanie a bit in this book, and even sells her grandma a red Corvette.",0
"If it s not one thing, it s another for poor Stephanie.",1
She just cant get a break.,1
"If you like a good laugh with your mysteries, this is the book for you.",0
"I suggest reading these books in order, but if you start out with this one, youll be able to follow whats going on without knowing the background of the other books.",1
"I was nt sure what to expect with Hot Six,  the first of Janet Evanovichs Stephanie Plum novels that Ive read  although it is not the first book in the series.",1
Im still not sure what the significance of the title is but I do know that all the Stephanie Plum novels have titles with numbers in them; the next book after Hot Six  is Seven Up. ,0
"In any event, Hot Six  is a delightful laugh-out-loud story of bumbling bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, who plies her trade among the common crooks in Trenton, N.J.",0
"Even as she finds and attempts to apprehend bail jumpers, she deals with a variety of personal problems that include a spunky grandmother, a policeman/boyfriend, a mysterious man who pushes all the right buttons on Stephanie, and a large zit on her chin.",0
She also has very bad luck with cars.,0
"Ms. Plum is around 30 years old and does nt give much of a description of her looks, but she must be among the better lookers to justify the attention she gets.",1
"The book starts with Stephanie talking an old female acquaintance down from jumping off a bridge, telling the would-be jumper that her body just wont look good in a dress when it s found  wearing slacks is the right way to dress for this particular form of suicide.",1
"Her first bounty-hunter case is to track down the Mooner,  a drugged-out modern-day hippie who manages to avoid work even as he takes lifes ups and downs in stride.",0
Mooner simply forgot to show up for his court appointment  as if he could ever remember  and peacefully goes to the police station with Stephanie.,0
"While there, he manages to torch Stephanies car but cheerfully offers to find her another car.",0
"The next case is Morris Munson, who failed to appear on homicide charges.",0
"He proves easy enough to find but much more difficult to snag, and there is much comedy as Stephanie and friend try to corner Munson.",0
"But the most intriguing case is that of Carlos Ranger  Manoso, who taught Stephanie her trade as a bounty hunter and who is now wanted for questioning in regard to the murder of a local mobsters son.",0
"There is something going on that does nt smell right with this, and both Stephanie and Ranger work to gather information on the case.",1
"Meanwhile, Grandmother Mazur moves in with Stephanie, turning Stephs sex life upside down and banishing her to the couch.",0
"Various people, from Ranger to Munson, break into Stephanies apartment as she attempts to sleep on the couch, keeping her tired and grumpy through the day.",0
"Grandma Mazur wakes up only at the end of the activities, complaining that Stephanie is running a nuthouse with all these late-night visitors.",0
"Then there is her boyfriend, Joe Morelli, a vice cop with the Trenton Police Department.",0
"Even as he gets increasingly frustrated that there is never a quiet moment to spend with Stephanie, she becomes an important conduit for information between the police and Ranger.",1
"Stephanie is feeling the frustration too, but youre never quite sure if it s Morelli or Ranger she lusts after.",1
"I had the feeling that either would make Steph happy, if only Grandma Mazur would nt stick her nose into the wrong place at the wrong time.",0
"Finally  as if she did nt have enough going on  Stephanie is saddled with a large omnivorous dog named Bob, who becomes the um, butt of many of the books jokes.",1
"And this book has LOTS of jokes, many of which are laugh-out-loud funny.",0
"There is a fine  and mostly unexpected twist  at the end and the book came to a satisfying conclusion, leaving many smiles in its wake.",0
This is a very fun story that should be enjoyed by any fans of Sue Grafton or Sarah Paretsky novels.,0
"In fact, Hot Six  is considerably wittier than those other fine novels and Stephanie Plum is a more sexually straightforward character than V. I. Warshawsky or Kinsey Milhone.",0
"Stephanie is never far  in spirit, anyway  from a tumble with one of her chosen guys and she gets more eager as the possibility keeps eluding her.",1
"And a tumble with Stephanie sounds terrific to this red-blooded guy, as she is smart, funny, human and sexy.",0
"Since my wife and I listened to Hot Six  as an unabridged book on tape, I looked at my wife from time to time and saw that she was enjoying the story every bit as much as I was, proving to me that Stephanie Plums humanity and wit transcends the sexes and appeals to any lover of action/detective novels.",0
"There is a lot of talk of sex in this book and there is a fair amount of rough language between the various characters, many of whom are criminals who probably seldom consult a dictionary.",0
And there is a grope or two but no actual sex.,0
"This book would be appropriate for anyone from a mature 16-year-old on up, although many of Stephanies problems are rooted in human nature with which a teen has little experience.",0
I probably should have started this series of books with an earlier title but I felt that I have nt missed anything by starting in the middle.,1
"As it is, there are lots of memorable scenes in Hot Six  that I still recall with a smile, including Bob ( the dog )  er, unloading in a car with two hitmen and Stephanie tackling a naked Morris Munson after she flushes him out of the shower.",0
"Hot Six  is a very fun book that will have you smiling at the antics of Stephanie Plum, one of the most smartly written and human characters that Ive seen in casual fiction.",0
"If the other books in this series are as good as this, Im in for a fun ride.",0
"Im giving this book 4.5 stars, rounded off to four in this case.",0
"After all, it takes a truly exceptional book to make it to five stars.",0
"Since I listened to this book as a book on tape, please forgive me if I misspell a name.",0
"The story was exceptionally well read by C.J. Critt, and her dramatic reading brought another dimension of enjoyment to this novel.",0
This is the sixth book in the Stephanie Plum series.,0
If you have never had the fun of reading a book in this series do not start with this one.,1
Go to the library and start with One For The Money and work your way up to Hot Six.,0
"Each book has the same characters, but there are fringe characters that are in some of the books and not in others.",1
"To begin with, Stephanie is a bounty hunter.",0
She was down on her luck and needed a job and went to work for a relative than owns this agency.,0
Is she qualified for this job?,0
"No, of course not.",1
That's part of the fun.,0
Stephanie has two love interests that she is having a problem choosing between.,0
"One of them is a Trenton vice cop, Joe Morelli.",0
She has known him since childhood.,0
"The second is Ranger( not his real name ), who is also a bounty hunter but is a man of mystery.",1
He has saved Stephanie on more than one occasion.,0
What's a girl to do?,0
"In Hot Six, Ranger becomes the hunted.",0
The son of an international black-market arms dealer has been murdered and Ranger was caught on tape leaving the scene.,0
He is wanted for questioning and Stephanie refuses the case.,0
This does not mean that she won't become very involved.,1
One of my favorite characters in this book is Stephanie's maternal grandmother.,0
She is not your typical grandmother.,1
Her favorite hobby is checking the obituaries and visiting the deceased in a particular funeral home.,0
She also carries a gun that she picked up at a garage sale.,0
Does she know how to use it?,0
Of course not.,1
In Hot Six she decides to leave Stephanie's mother and father's home and move in with Stephanie.,0
"As if that isn't enough, Stephanie is asked to take care of a huge dog that eats everything in sight.",1
Stephanie's sex life is ruined.,0
I chose to read Hot Six on the deck in my swing on a glorious day.,0
As usual my German shepard was with me.,0
All of a sudden he was so excited and trying to get on the swing with me.,0
I wondered what got him started when I realized I was laughing out loud.,0
"There is humor, some of it wicked on every page.",0
This is a fast paced story that you'll not want to put down.,1
If you are offended easily by off color language or humor this book is not for you.,0
Move over Sue Grafton and make way for Janet Evanovich.,0
I can't wait for book # /# 7. Enjoy!,0
"My first epinion since the passing of Epinions great... Hard_to_Please aka Mark, and since the terrorist attacks on September 11th.",0
"I was gone, just needed some time away.",0
Ready???,0
"Thanksgiving dinner, my older sister Colleen tells me the new James Patterson book featuring my beloved Dr. Detective Alex Cross came out Tuesday.",0
I had no idea!!!,1
"The next day, BLACK FRIDAY!!!, I, being the brave, adventurous, and loopy chick that I am, ran to the mall!!!!!!!!",0
"I bought a few gifts, and one for myself, which kinda seems selfish, it being the season of GIVING!.",0
"However, I rationalized!",0
"Yes, I sooo wanted to read"" Violets are Blue, but it's really NOT just for me, both of my sisters want to read it too!",1
"Therefore, it's not selfish, because it wasn't JUST for me...but the three of us: )",1
...and on to the review....,0
"Violets are Blue, the James Patterson novel is like many of his others starring the infamous Alex Cross.",0
Many previous characters from prior books show up again.,0
"Patterson, does not expect you to know who they are, so he gives background on each, so you aren't lost, if this is the first book of his that you happen to pick up.",1
"---woohooo Flyers just scored---- oops, sorry, I'm watching tv.--",0
"Alex Cross whom is a Washington D.C. homicide detective and psychologist, and is also a liaison with the FBI, is being called in again, by High ranking FBI guy, and friend, Kyle Craig.",0
"This time around, the dead are hung upside down, drained of most of their blood, bitten, and bitten, and bitten again.",0
"People are dying, all over from these killers.",0
"The case takes Alex to California where he meets San Fransisco Inspector Jamilla Hughs, where he learns of the Vampire theory, where he researches, and talks to so called REAL Vampires.",0
"Alex is of course skeptical, I mean, come on, VAMPIRES???? Patterson doesn't expect you to believe in Vampires, but you will believe in those that want to be vampires, and live their lives impersonating the dark, fanged, murderous creatures.",1
"As if trying to find the killers of these brutal blood draining attacks weren't enough, Alex is being stalked, via cell phone by a man that calls himself the MASTERMIND.",1
"The Mastermind threatens Alex, and his family ( his grandmother""nana-mamma"", his three children, Damon, Jannie, and lil Alex ), and everyone he loves.",0
"The Mastermind taunts him, and he is always One Step Ahead.",0
"He knows where Alex is at every moment, and He wants Alex dead!",0
"When you first open the book, reading the Prologue, it grips you, right then, right there, so early on, you have no choice but to read, quickly, with anticipation, knowing in your heart that Alex has to be triumphant!, doesn't he?",1
"I was trying to find clues, in the text I was reading, the scenes I created in my head from the words Patterson wrote, I too was a detective, a profiler, a psychologist, a puzzle solver of sorts.",0
Who is the Mastermind?,0
"Where are the bloodsucking killers, how do I stop them.",0
"As with Patterson's previous books, there isn't any graphic sex, or much foul language.",1
It may not even be something the normal person would even pick up.,1
"Patterson's gift to the public,his fans, us readers, is his consistent, mind boggling, adrenaline pumping, realistic novels of the chase of a madman, or madmen, blood, murders, cases to be solved.",0
"-Note- If you have never read a Patterson book featuring Doctor Detective Alex Cross, but have seen one or both of the movies,"" Kiss the Girls"", and/or"" Along Came a Spider"".",1
"Please, dismiss them.",0
"READ the books, read this book.",0
Because as you and I know 99 % of the time the movies are never as good as the books that they are adapted from.,1
"READ IT, READ IT, READ IT, READ IT, READ IT, READ IT...(annoying, aren't I? ): )",0
PEACE,0
"Im a huge Stephen King fan, so when he came out with Eyes of The Dragon, I was ecstatic with happiness.",0
"Eyes of the Dragon, first off, is not a horror book like SK is known for, it s a fairy tale/science fiction/fantasy book that is more into wizards and heroes than monsters and blood.",1
"In Eyes of the Dragon, SK proves again ( as he does in all of his books ) that he is at the top of his game still at his old age.",0
"Even though, he has retired, his memory still lives on through his wonderful stories.",0
"Eyes of the Dragon shows, yet again, that he can jump from genre to genre as hes always done.",0
"For example, he jumped from horror ( Carrie ) to romance/drama ( Dolores Claiborne ) to fantasy ( The Dark Tower ) and did it well without controversy.",1
THE STORY,0
"When King Roland dies, his kingdom is in turmoil because one of his sons, Peter, is framed for murdering him while his other son, Thomas, takes the throne knowing that his brother is innocent and that the wizard, Flagg, killed his father, but he does nt care because his father did nt love him anyway so his father deserved his death.",1
Will Peter become King like he rightfully should?,0
Will Flagg get his deserved punishment?,0
Will Thomas apologize to his fathers grave and to his imprisoned brother?,0
FIND OUT AND BUY THE BOOK,0
The book itself moves rather fast without leaving the reader in the dust about the character s past.,1
"Usually in Kings books, he writes slowly and boringly so that all it does is get me NOT interested in one of his books ( for example, IT was sort of like that and so was Insomnia FOR ME), but in a couple books, he writes them really well and makes me interested his characters ( for example, Bag of Bones, Misery, Salems Lot, and Pet Sematary ).",1
The only real thing that I did nt AT ALL like about this book is that the ending was horribly rushed.,1
It spent about 20 pages setting up the ending and then it took about three pages to pull it off and it was awfully unfinished and fast.,0
It sucked because you dedicated 380 pages to all of the characters and then the ending just sucks.,0
MAN!,0
One of the coolest parts about this book is the artwork every couple of chapters.,0
"The chapters arent really long like most of Kings  books ( which is a good thing for readers on the go ), but the artwork is amazing.",1
"I only artist I really like is H.R. Giger, but Im really giving David Palladini, because his sense of textures and shading is pretty amazing and his art catches the visual side of the reader and is really enthralling.",0
"Overall, his character development is good, but I did nt really get to know Flagg as much as I wanted to, so it sort of sucks because I sort of wanted to know his past, what his childhood was like.",1
"It was sort of disappointing to get to the end of the book and not know all of the characters as much as you wanted, but it s no biggie.",1
"If you are a big Stephen King fan and love his work, but want a sort of break from his horror/sexual stories, then you should definitely check out Eyes of the Dragon because it is appropriate ( he wrote it for his daughter and I DONT THINK that there is that many cuss words or any sexual tension at all ) and the story is sensational and unfolds at a fast, smooth pace.",1
"Buy it, you owe it to yourself and thanks for reading.",0
JiggyJay,0
Talk about a change of pace.,0
I've always loved King for his horror.,0
And my other love is fantasy.,0
This is the best of two worlds.,0
"When a friend of mine told me that King had writen a fantasy, I was intrigued.",0
And the book lived up to my expectations.,0
The story tastes sharply of a fairy tale.,0
"The good prince, the bad prince, the evil bad guy.",0
The younger prince is jealous of the older brother who will be king.,0
"The evil magician works his spells through the weaker, younger brother.",0
The characters are realistic and endearing.,0
The tale keeps you on the edge of your seat.,0
I found it to be a real page turner.,0
"I would highly recommend this book to any fantasy lover, it fits the bill, surprising from someone who does horror so well.",0
But it is great.,0
"Once upon a time, Stephen King wrote a fairy tale.",0
The eyes of the Dragon is a truly mesmorizing and fascinating story.,0
"A fairy tale for adults, but I think this could be for older children also.",0
"It doesn't have the customary violence and language that most Stephen King novels have, and it isn't so intense that it will frighten you.",1
""" Why then would I want to read it?""",0
You may be asking yourself.,0
Well you want to read it because it is a great novel.,0
The story is set in an ancient kingdom called Delain.,0
"The story centers around two young boys, princes, the son of the King.",0
The two brothers are Peter and Thomas.,0
"Peter, the oldest, is in line to be the next king.",0
Peter is the perfect child.,0
"Everyone loves Peter, he is handsome, intelligent, and caring.",0
"Thomas, on the other hand is none of these.",0
"He is a lonely little boy disliked and ignored by all, even his father.",0
"Thomas is ignored by all, that is, except for one person: the kings magician Flagg.",0
Flagg has been in the kingdom for years; as long as anyone can remember.,0
"Before Peter can become King, his father is murdered and he is framed for it.",0
"Since Peter is royalty, he can't be killed, so he is sent up into a tower to live out the rest of his life.",1
The only people he sees are his guards.,0
"The only thing Peter has to pass his time is his dollhouse that he played with when he was little, the only other convience he was allowed was a napkin to eat with, these he specially asked for.",0
Thomas is now the King.,0
"However, Thomas is young and needs someone to help rule the kingdom.",0
Who would that be?,0
Why Flagg of course.,0
Thomas knows a secret that could destroy him and is slowly driving him mad.,0
"This secret could not only destroy him, it would definitely destroy Flagg.",0
What is this secret?,0
Read the story: find out.,0
"Will Peter ever get out, or will he die in the tower?",0
Once again read the story find out.,0
I love Stephen King.,0
The scarier the story the better.,0
"However, this is just about my favorite Stephen King story.",0
"It isn't scary, but it is enthralling.",1
"For the more avid King readers out there; check out the reference to this story in the Dark Tower series, Roland mentions some of the characters in this story that passed through his town when he was young.",0
"For anyone out there who just wants to read a good story, check out this book.",0
"It isn't violent ( well there are a few parts, but not usual King violence ).",1
It isn't vulgar or sexual.,1
It is just a great read.,0
I recommend this to anyone and everyone.,0
One of Newton's laws of motion states ( paraphrased ) that a body in motion tends to remain in motion.,0
The principle under discussion is commonly known as inertia.,0
"Inertia, we all know, is not merely a physical phenomenon, it's also a phenomenon that exerts influence over such varied arenas as the stock market and personal relationships -- how many couples do you know, for instance, that stay together far too long because the act of breaking up takes too much energy?",1
"Inertia occurs in the marketplace, of that we can be certain.",0
One of the most telling forms of inertia is a consumer's attachment to a brand or to a model.,0
"Such devotion asserts itself in an"" It done me right the last time, so I'll stick by it the next time"" attitude; a sort of Tammy Wynette* model for consumption.",0
"We often sense inertia here at Epinions, especially in the Automotive category, where hardly a day goes by that I don't read a review stating that"" I have always bought {insert car maker } cars..."" In fact, automobiles may be the only consumer product in which inertia is an inherited force: hardly a day goes by in which I don't read a review that says,""my family has always bought insert car maker cars...""",0
"Perhaps I grew up in an unusual family: my parents drove Pontiacs, Fords, Chevvies, Dodges, Chryslers, Oldsmobiles, Studebakers, Ramblers... you name it, they drove it some time in the fifties, sixties, or seventies.",0
"And so I never developed that somewhat slavish brand loyalty -- and, I venture, the condition best described by the observation that""love is blind.""",1
But I know that there are a lot of blind consumers out there.,0
America's Most Popular Car?!?,0
Advertisements tell us that the Ford Taurus is America's most popular car.,0
"Note, however, that you can always tell when an advertising man is lying because his lips are moving... What is true is that the Taurus is one of the most popular cars ever sold in this country; and ( if you lump Mercury Sable in with the Taurus ) there are as many of them on the road as there are of any other vehicle.",0
"More importantly, the Taurus -- an ugly, melted-looking critter at its birth -- marked Ford's re-emergence as a power in the mid-sized car market after more than a decade of shoddy quality, ill-advised experimentation, and simple ignorance of consumer trends.",0
"Finally, America was making a car that was competitive against Japanese imports, so much so that it actually began making inroads into that import market.",0
Hooray for American ingenuity and engineering!,0
"As such, the Taurus developed a near-cult following; giving a new generation a vehicle on which to lavish the family's Ford addiction.",0
"Suddenly if you ached to drive a stylish, dependable car, you didn't have to hide the Toyota from Dad or watch Uncle Stan sneer at the Honda.",1
"And so the Taurus ( and its""name-plate twin"" the Mercury Sable ) became Ford's"" comeback kid.""",0
"Three cheers for Henry, Edsel, and the rest of the Fords!",0
Fast Forward to 2002,0
"Over the years, I've driven lots of Tauruses ( Tauri? ); always as a rental.",0
"I've driven them through snow, in the baking desert sun, at the beach, and on winding mountain roads.",0
"While I've never been tempted to buy a Taurus ( frankly, it's larger than I need ), I've never been unimpressed by the car, either.",1
"This is a vehicle that's always seemed to be a solid, dependable -- if somewhat boring -- performer; but then I'd never reviewed one for Epinions, either.",1
"So here's my chance, after having looked at a 2002 Taurus with a critical eye:",0
The Car,0
"My ever-faithful suppliers at Enterprise rented me a 2002 Taurus SE model, a four-door, with the stock V6 Vulcan engine and a four-speed automatic transmission.",0
"This particular model has a"" convertible"" front seat, which is a bench seat with a center panel that unfolds into a console and/or armrest to create the illusion of bucket seats.",0
"The vehicle came equipped with dual airbags, power doors/windows/mirrors, cloth seats, AM/FM/Cassette, tilt wheel, cruise control, intermittent wipers, styled aluminum wheels, and AC.",0
I picked it up with about 5500 miles on the clock; I turned it back in with just over 6000 - five days and 500+ miles.,0
"About 400 miles were highway driving, the rest on city streets and freeways in the Austin and Houston areas.",0
"Weather was mostly dry, though my return to Austin encountered some moderate showers.",0
Styling Notes,0
"For those interested in such things, the vehicle was a metallic charcoal gray with a multi-shade gray interior.",0
"That particular combination is apparently quite popular; one night in my hotel parking garage I had to choose among the Taurus, a Mustang, and a Contour all in that color combination.",0
I stayed with the Taurus'cause I didn't have keys for the Mustang.,1
This model was restyled by Ford with the 2000 model year.,0
"Speaking from memory, earlier models were far more dependent upon the oval motif, and still retained some of the original version's melted external contours.",0
"The restyling possesses slightly more angularity than the old version, with sharper slope breaks at the base of the rear window and on the trunk line.",0
"The interior has much of the"" chunky"" look adopted by many automakers in the latest'90s and early 2000s.",0
"Blocks of foam-filled""naugahyde"" tend to fight for supremacy with contoured plastic panels in the dash and on the doors.",0
"The seating arrangements do not appear to have changed from earlier models; and the instrument panel and dashboard layouts are little changed, if at all.",1
Driver-Car Interface,0
The Taurus handles moderately well for a mid-sized family sedan; cornering is responsive with neither crispness nor poor control.,1
"The driver has a good connection to the road when compared to larger vehicles such as the Lincoln Continental, but is more isolated than when driving most Japanese sedans ( Mitsubishi Galant, Toyota Camry ).",0
Braking tends to feel a bit mushy at highway speeds.,0
"The stock 155-hp Vulcan V6 possesses adequate reserve power at highway speeds, but is noticeably weak on acceleration from a standing start ( this is the least powerful of three available V6 engines ).",0
I averaged about 21.5 MPG with this engine ( note: mostly highway driving ).,0
The four-speed overdrive transmission shifts smoothly and responsively for the most part.,0
"In this model, the shifter is mounted to the steering column.",0
"The cockpit is laid out comfortably, with most controls easily accessible and few ( if any ) surprises.",0
The intermittent wipers and headlight dimmer switch are located on the turn signal stalk.,0
The cruise control buttons are on the face of the steering wheel; on-off on the left and accelerate/coast/resume on the right.,0
Driving Environment,0
"The driver's seat in this configuration has a seat-back tilt adjustment and forward/backward adjustment, both manual.",0
There is no lumbar adjustment.,1
"Driver seating is relatively comfortable, though the lack of lumbar support is somewhat bothersome.",0
"Rear-seat entry in the four-door models is a piece of cake, and rear-seat room is average or above for vehicles of this class.",0
There are sturdy anchor-points for two child car seats on the car's rear deck.,0
"There is a single small, rather strangely-shaped glove compartment and the ubiquitous door-side map pockets.",0
Ford provides a single cubby in the dashboard for front-seat passengers.,0
Rear-seat passengers have pockets on the seatbacks suitable for stowing a magazine and little else.,0
"There are two power ports, both in front ( one doubles as a cigarette lighter ).",0
The rearseat passengers have two flip-out cupholders; front seat passengers have two cupholders molded into the underside of the fold-up seatbottom.,0
This latter surface also has minimal storage for cassettes and a few coins; it dumps its contents when inverted ( no surprise there ) to form a seat cushion.,1
The only locking space in the cabin is the glove compartment.,0
"Note, that when the seat is in""bench"" configuration, there are no cup holders and little storage ( probably moot, anyway, since the room would be rather limited ).",1
"The trunk is a capacious 17 cubic feet, although the sill is quite high, making loading cumbersome for shorter drivers and passengers.",0
"The circumference is notched for a cargo net, though there was none in the rental vehicle ( it may be standard and have""disappeared"" ).",1
The lid opens with a key or a dash-mounted remote; and there is also an emergency latch for opening from the inside.,0
"The rear seats do not fold down, nor is there any sort of""pass-through"" for carrying long cargo; a disappointing lack of a feature available in other trim lines and on competing models.",1
"Engine noise is somewhat intrusive, partially because this particular engine seems to be rather""grumbly.""",0
"Road noise is minimal unless the road surface is coarse, but wind noise is also rather pronounced.",0

On Quality,0
One of the reasons many US buyers deserted American carmakers in the seventies and early eighties was the perception of poor quality in US cars.,0
"If all American cars are as poorly made as this particular Taurus, the exodus should begin anew.",0
"In only four day's exposure, I noted the following defects:",0
"- The ignition key was hard to turn and more than once failed to release from the""START"" position -- this left the starter motor engaged until I manually released the key.",0
#NAME?,0
#NAME?,0
#NAME?,1
- The fuel gage would not rise above 7/8 even when filled.,1
Overall,0
"Ford appears to have decided to rest on its laurels with this vehicle, and has not done what is necessary to keep it competitive with the Camry, Accord, Galant, Impala, and the like.",1
I suspect they're counting on brand loyalty -- inertia -- to keep the Taurus selling while they expend all their energy on their SUVs.,0
"Not a good idea, Ford!",1
"Not recommended, for unimaginative exterior styling, some truly stupid interior styling, poor quality, and average drivability.",1
There are better cars on the road; let's buy them instead.,0
"Tammy Wynette: country-Western artist, perhaps most widely known for her counter-feminist anthem"" Stand By Your Man""",0
Maybe it's just me...,0
"But, my husband's white 2002 Ford Taurus SE is bland, chintzy, and nothing to be proud of.",0
The most redeeming quality of the vehicle is that it's his company car and we aren't forced to shell out our hard earned cash for the not-quite-mediocre piece of crap.,1
"With that said, I have nothing against Ford or the Taurus for that matter.",0
"But, the fact remains that the auto giant made very few ( if any ) improvements over the 1999 SE model.",0
"I, in fact, have a sneaking suspicion that the company has gotten a bit too comfortable in the market and in the buying public.",0
They have a built-in audience that will buy a Ford Taurus regardless of higher quality and similarly priced competition ( like my own lovely 2002 Chevrolet Impala LS ).,0
THE EXTERIOR,0
"From the outside, the 2002 Taurus SE looks pretty good.",0
The style is a definite improvement over the late 1990's'spaceship look.',0
It in fact is a combination of the more popular earlier and boxier Taurus lines and the style popularized a few years back by creative Japanese auto manufacturers.,0
"The side panels are relatively blah, while the back and front are slightly attractive.",0
"Ford designers should nt be proud of their work on the car, redesigned initially for the 2000 model year.",0
"As with the 1999 model, the vehicle has some issues with aerodynamics.",0
The car should have been tested further in the wind tunnel.,0
Why?,0
"Well, if you drive one and haven't yet noticed rode grime and mud collects in strategic locations toward the back bumper.",1
Its not a major issue when you're driving but goes to show that the body isn't perfectly designed.,1
THE INTERIOR,0
"Upon sitting down in the bland medium-gray interior, the first thing that struck me was that it looks and feels cheaply made.",0
"Considering the fact that the car retails for over $ 20K, this is nt a good thing.",1
"There are strange metallic decorations, a badly contoured dash, and not in the least bit attractive console.",1
"Fortunately for Ford, the console is nicely arranged and can be accessed easily by the driver.",0
"It's roomy enough for a mid size vehicle, though the seats aren't nearly as comfortable as some other similar vehicles.",1
The already uncomfortable seats have no features to speak of.,1
You can tilt the back and push the seat forward or backward.,0
"Aside from that, the 2002 Taurus SE lacks lumbar support and any of the other perks that are sometimes available.",0
The passenger seat is similar while the back bench is a bit cramped and not particularly comfortable for riders.,1
"It would be good for small children, but by the time kids become teens the seat might be a bit too small.",0
"With an adequate 17 square foot trunk, there is plenty of room in the Taurus.",0
"The trunk is rather thick, though is lacking when it comes to deepness ( extending toward the rear seats ).",0
The rear seats are fixed and cannot be folded down in any way to allow for added capacity.,1
This is a major flaw in the design.,0
The SE model we have came with a CD player with average speakers and no real bonuses.,1
"There isn't anything special to speak of about the temperature controls aside from saying,""yes, there is in fact air conditioning.""",0
One minor complaint I have is that the visors are cheaply made and the back-side mirrors lack lights.,1
"If memory serves, I do believe that the 1999 Taurus SE at least featured that luxury.",0
"Other standard features include power windows, mirrors, and brakes and keyless entry.",0
Just don't expect any good surprises.,1
This is a pretty stripped down car.,0
THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE,0
I will admit that I'm jaded because of the 2002 Chevy Impala LS.,0
"That car has a lot of energy, pick up, and is easy to drive.",0
The 2002 Taurus SE on the other hand feels like a dog.,0
The usually adequate V6 Vulcan with 155 horsepower engine is slow to accelerate.,0
The automatic shifting at times has problems between 1st and 2nd gears adding to the already problematic driving experience.,0
"Once you get up to speed, the car functions decently, though not perfectly.",1
Passing is a laborious process.,0
What I can say is at least the brakes work well on both highways and city roads.,0
The steering wheel-mounted cruise control is easy to use and functions pretty well.,0
Just a tiny tap of the brakes and the cruise immediately shuts off.,0
"So far as gas mileage, expect to get an average of just over 20 miles per gallon ( despite Fords claims of higher ).",0
As compared to my Impala ( with a much larger engine ) that's not too good.,1
That larger vehicle gets about 25 miles to the gallon on average.,0
The Taurus' smallish engine should in reality be more efficient.,0
"So, basically, you get a low energy car with iffy gas mileage.",0
Is this car sounding good to you yet?,0
I hope not.,1
FINAL ASSESSMENT,0
"When compared to the earlier style model, the 2002 Taurus SE looks nicer from the outside though it took a big step back with the interior.",0
"At well over $ 20,000 for this car, it s not a good buy.",1
"I would recommend buyers look elsewhere to the aforementioned Chevy Impala, the Honda Accord, the Toyota Camry, and even the Chevy Malibu before settling on the Taurus.",0
It really is a disappointing vehicle.,0
I was given this car as a company vehicle when I first arrived in the US 2 months ago.,0
"My first thought on seeing it was""what an ugly heap!"".",0
I was more impressed by the luggage space as it fairly easily swallowed all of the stuff a family of 4 carry when travelling to a new land.,0
Driving from the airport to the hotel I was immediately struck by how soft the seats were.,0
Almost sofa like in comfort if you only travel for a few miles.,0
Problem is that for longer journeys they are completely lacking in support and I was in agony after only 50 miles or so.,0
"Next nuisance item was the multifunction stalk for controlling lights, wipers etc. Really, these functions should be seperated but the use of a column gear change prevents that.",0
"These column mounted gear stalks are very quaint, but personally if I never see one again it will be too soon.",1
"Performance was, well how could I put this without cussing, absolutely useless.",1
That thing couldn't pull the skin off a rice pudding.,0
It is flatter than roadkill and only slightly more attractive.,0
I don't know its top speed as I never felt sufficiently in control to test it.,1
It felt like it would have trouble outrunning a moped but I never had the courage to try it.,1
Brakes are adequate without being startling.,1
I did find that parking brake to be hopeless.,0
Anybody living in a hilly area is going to become rapidly hacked off with not having a normal handbrake rather than the stupid foot operated system.,1
It is impossible to gradually release a foot system so making fully controllable getaways a distant dream.,0
Handling.,0
Handling?,0
"Nope, not on this thing!",1
This is the sort of softly suspended barge on wheels American cars used to be like.,0
"This might have been acceptable in 1975, but things have moved on a long way since then.",0
My last 3 cars were 2 SAABs and an Audi A4 so perhaps criticising the handling is a little unfair.,0
Problem is that Ford's offering in this category in Europe is the Mondeo and it kicks bottom!,0
"Now that is a car they should be offering to the American public, rather than the shoddy heap of garbage that is the Taurus.",0
You'd never see me buy one of those but I drove enough in a rental car to make myself a good opinion.,1
Quite silent at highway speed except for tire noise.,0
"Handling is not too bad and healthy, body roll is contained, brakes are strong enough in spite of the absence of rear discs.",1
"Seats have absolutely no lateral support, which makes driving on twisty roads a real pain.",1
"Auto gearbox 4th gear is way too long, engine lacks torque to hold it unless road is flat.",0
Steering mounted gear lever is clumsy although it saves space for stuff between the seats.,0
"Upshifts are okay although not without hesitations at low speeds, but downshifts are slow.",1
"Build quality is really average to low, I had the steering lock mechanism coming out inadvertently.",0
"Plastics quality and assy leaves to be desired, we are far, far away from Audi-league.",0
Well lets get right to the point I was a big owner of Taurus.,0
I have own practicly all models except this one.,0
Taurus has always been on the cutting edge for technology and power over most manufactures cars that are comparable to the taurus.,0
One of the main reasons why Taurus made it into the nascar races because Taurus was building a name for themselves of making powerfull cars. in 1995 Taurus came out with their ultimate car which was the 3.8liter v6 SHO taurus folks let me tell you if you ever get a chance to ride in a 3.8 liter v6 SHO taurus do so because the minute that person lays his foot on the pedal your jaw will be in the back seat.,0
Why am i bringing this up because this is all important do to the fact how ford taurus has progressed into a awesome car.,0
That i kept buying because each year they kept getting better and better.,0
Then all sudden the ovals came out and a smaller taurus.,0
Then next was the smaller engine.,0
when i ask the manufacture if they have more engine packages he said no 3.0 is it.,1
Come on.,0
So i forgave them and look into the interior i wasn't impress it wasnt up to par with the typical norm of ford taurus in the pass.,0
It was cheap material.,0
The hole dash board layout is totaly illogical.,0
It came with a cassete deck has default and no cd player.,1
I'm sorry but cassete deck built into the dash.,0
Cassete deck shouldnt even exist anymore in the car.,0
I praticlly laughed my head off when i saw this.,0
ford most still be living in the 1980's.,0
Most foreign cars if not all come standard deafualt with a cd player built into the dash.,1
cassete then becomes optional and thats how it should be.,0
Air climate control totally sucks should be digital and temperature driven by degress.,0
They moved the unlock and lock on the up part of the door and not down where the fingers would normally be.,1
who in the world came up with that idea they must have been smokin somethin.,0
The spedometer totally sucks also you cant tell what the heck speed your doing.,0
theirs more lines and dashes then their are actuall speed listings so you have to study the damn dash to figure out what speed you are doing.,0
The console cup holders arent big enough.,0
The sterring on the car seems like it has a huge understeer to it.,0
It almost seems like you have to turn the wheel around 5 times just to get it to do a square corner.,0
On the passanger side their is abosultey no place for you to lay you feet down flat.,1
When you sit down your feet are always propt up on something.,0
And of course i could go on with the list.,0
The only good thing it has going for itself is the fact that it has a smooth ride.,0
and thats it.,0
o and the trunk size is decent.,0
thats it.,0
O just though of another bad the sound system in the car is terriable its really tinney sounding and the radio stations sound really far away when their not.,1
Ford has ruined the Taurus and this model i will not buy.,1
It breaks me heart to say this but i will probably not by another taurus until i see improvement.,1
I will be heading over to the toyota series of cars now.,0
Because it seems like the foreigns have more innovation and techonolgy in their cars now.,0
Ford is still living in the 1980's.,0
And i do beleive when they came up with the ideas for this new series of ford taurus that they must have been smoken something for sure.,0
"The Mitsubishi Lancer is all new for the 2002 model year, replacing the cute, yet infamous Mitsubishi Mirage.",0
"While the Mirage was a cheap car made with cheap materials, its successor boasts only slight quality improvements at a much higher price.",0
"While the commercials may have young trendy adults singing to' Barenaked Ladies' and seeming to have a great time with this car, I have come to the conclusion that singing along to trendy rock tunes with the Lancer's 100 watt stereo system may be one of this car's only fun attributes.",0
"For 2002 the Mitsubishi Lancer comes in 3 trim lines, the ES ( my tester ), LS, and OZ.",0
"All trim lines come with a 2.0 SOHC 4-cylinder engine that pumps out a lackluster 120 horsepower at 5,500 RPM, and 130 lb-ft of torque at 4,250 RPM.",0
"Power is distributed to the front wheels via a standard 5-speed manual transmission, or a 4-speed fully automatic transmission ( as was in my tester ).",0
Note: If you plan on buying the sport model'OZ' Edition don't plan on getting any better performance than with the base models.,1
The OZ has the same 120 horsepower 2.0 4-banger mated with the same transmissions.,0
"According to the November 02 issue of Motor Trend Magazine, a version of the high performance Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VII will be available sometime next year.",0
Driving impressions:,0
"With a hefty curb weight of 2,700 Lbs, 120 horses, and peak torque reached a relatively high RPM, off-the-line acceleration mated with the 4-speed fully automatic transmission came, at first with slight hesitation, and then with needed patience.",0
"The engine and exhaust noise is slightly isolated from the driver, but no better or worse than say a 1997 SOHC base modeled Ford Escort.",1
"Compared to its predecessor; the Mirage, the 2002 Lancer ES does seem a bit zippy, but this out-right performance is far from blowing my skirt up.",0
"Although the 4-speed automatic transmission is somewhat smooth, it is probably not the best pick for this SOHC 2.0 set-up.",1
I'd recommend going with the 5-speed if you must choose this car.,0
"While not exactly'super fun', handling in the 2002 Lancer ES is well balanced and surprisingly sporty.",1
"Despite the heavy curb weight, and the small wheels and tires, I never felt that I was going to lose control on the twistys, nor was I conscious of this car's relatively hefty curb weight while driving.",1
"Body roll is minimal, and the steering is excellent.",0
Cruising in this small sedan is also good.,0
"The suspension, while being sporty, also allows for a comfortable ride while cruising at high speeds.",0
"Bumps and rattles can be present on certain road surfaces, but this usually is not too annoying.",1
"Wind, engine, and road noise do play a factor at high speeds as with most economy cars, but this should only aggravate the most picky of drivers.",0
Hills are taken fairly well.,0
"The 4-speed automatic will shift down into 3rd gear on almost any incline, but the ride remains calm, and the engine doesn't get as loud or as fussy as with some car's engines in this class while accomplishing these sorts of tasks.",1
Braking is average.,0
The Lancer ES comes standard with front wheel disc/rear drum brakes without ABS.,1
"Despite this cost effective, health hazard set-up, the Lancer stopped with little effort and felt more like a 4-wheel disc set-up than the dinosaur set-up which it was equipped with.",0
Fuel economy is a little disappointing.,0
The EPA rates this car with an automatic at only 31 MPG during freeway driving.,0
This EPA is almost 10 MPG less than the EPA ratings for the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla.,0
"Engine Gripes: If Mitsubishi is going to charge this much cash for their cars, they are going to need to pay much more detail to their powertrains.",0
"SOHC engines in expensive cars, or even sport oriented cars are not at all desired.",1
"More technology, DOHC designs, including VVT would be welcomed.",0
"Mitsubishi needs to stop spending so much money on their fancy commercials and start investing this money on making some good cars like they once did, i.e the Mitsubishi 3000GT.",0
Interior Accommodation:,0
"I have read a few reviews on this car over at www.cars.com,",0
"and despite many reviewers saying this car has the interior set-up of the 1980s Chrysler K cars, it is nowhere near that bad, but the interior does leave a lot to be desired.",0
"The interior, while very dated does have a functional design and easy ergonomics.",0
"The drivers position is also very good which offers great vision in all directions, and easy access to the instrumentation.",0
"With the convenience package, and even without it, amenities are plentiful for a car in this category.",1
"Dual Air bags, AC, intermittent windshield wipers, tachometer, and a 100 watt, 4-speaker Mitsubishi sound system is standard.",0
"This sound system is clear, but no Bose by any means.",1
"The convenience package adds some items such as cruise control, and 60/40 split bench rear seats.",0
www.mitsubishi.com,0
has more info on all standard and optional equipment that can be had for the ES and other Lancer trim lines.,0
"The front bucket seats are a major complaint, I found them hard to the'butt touch', and offered little back support.",0
"The Lancer ES's cargo and storage is adequate at most, the trunk is small, but there are plenty of pockets in the cabin for small items, like broken knobs etc.",0
Exterior Innovation:,0
"The exterior of the 2002 Lancer is really nothing to write home about, but it's no ugly duckling either.",1
Mitsubishi played it pretty safe with the styling of this small sedan.,0
"I do like the front fascia, as it offers a chrome grille, and an'open mouthed' front bumper which adds a little more sexy modern appeal to this otherwise blase'get lost in traffic' car.",0
The headlights are with see-through effects which also help this car keep with the'times'.,0
"Price, Reliability, and Warranty:",0
"For 2002 the Lancer ES with a manual transmission starts at around $ 14,000, however, with options, such as an automatic transmission the price quickly rises to near $ 17,000 as was my tester's sticker price.",0
"Mitsubishi has never been known for their reliability, however it has been improving, if anything does go wrong with your 2002 Lancer, Mitsubishi offers an'average' 3 year, 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty, and a 5 year, 60,000 mile powertrain warranty.",1

"However, the back seat was an entirely different story.",0
"Rigid and firm with little leg room for my 8 and 9 year old, they constantly complained.",0
"During the first year, the car performed well.",0
"Electronics worked well, engine was strong, etc.",0
"However, after the 1 year mark hit, little things started happening all at once: Driver window would not slide back up without an initial KER-KLUNK, bulbs began blowing out, the lighter quit working ( not the fuse ), and the engine, in spite of professional maintenance, began to sound ill.",1

"Instead, the current top-end Eclipses are basically family sedans with a body kit.",0
Platform cars can be good - witness the top-end Golf-platform Audi TTs.,0
"The Eclipse however makes too many practicality sacrifices for appearance, and too few for performance.",0

"Better straight-line performance and cornering thrills can be obtained from a cooking Mazda MP3  saving the driver $ 7,000, and gaining in rear seat room.",0
"While arguably resisting understeer better than some older Eclipse front-drivers, the inherent lack of grip of the FWD drivetrain simply doesn't work when married to an overweight platform, and soft springing that exacerbates weight transfer away from the drive wheels.",0
"In short, at anything other than a straight line, in the dry, wheelspin dramatically limits any attempt to make progress.",0

"Cornering in the dry on stock rubber similarly brings out the lack of corner-exit drive, and a sinking feeling as applying power has the nose of the car heading for hedges and low-flying pedestrians.",0
"And while queasy, low-speed four-wheel drift feels fun in a Subaru Impreza, two-wheel drive wheelspin impresses no-one.",0
"So as a performance vehicle, the Eclipse is a lousy effort.",0
"FWD performance cars have to be light to get around their weight-and-power distribution handling disadvantages, get that power to the road, and avoid dangerous and irritating torque steer.",0
For example: the Civic Type R; the Renault Clio 172.,0
"American drivers seem not to have noticed, which is why Nissan wows them with the likes of the current VQ-equipped 3.5 Altima.",1
"Apparently, to some, high-performance means a barge that pinballs violently between the Armco if the driver is foolish enough to unleash its 250 horsepower.",0
So whats good about it?,0
The handling setup has its good points.,0
"Despite low-profile 215/40 VR-17s, the car works quite well in straight line cruising.",0
"The car wont tramline noticeably, and its soft, reasonably damped suspension is effective at insulating the driver from poor road surfaces.",0
"While the nose of the car will push horribly wide and is difficult to place accurately ( even absent throttle-understeer ) in sub-50 mph cornering, the steering setup gives a strong on-center feel with considerable stability, and the vehicle will track straight with a bare touch  or none - on the wheel.",1
"In faster corners, the car is pleasant and predictable, like a good mid-size family sedan, though the V6 needs attention to stay in the upper reaches of the rev-range if meaningful drive is to be made.",0
"Brakes feel powerful, if slightly over-servod at low speeds ( like most cars ), but above 70mph are less good.",0
"Worse, the soft springs encourage the back to pass the front if hard braking is attempted from high speeds, especially on mild uphill inclines.",0
"Though some reviewers complain about the engine note, people who like the sound of a V6 will find it pleasant around town.",0
The exhaust system has obviously been tuned to give it its mellow burble  much quieter and less Harley-like than a Ford pushrod V6  just off idle.,0
"This turns into a pleasingly smooth, turbine like, big-multi roar as you approach redline.",0
"The manual transmissions slight notchiness is hidden by a solid, heavily-weighted throw that gives it a quality  feel, though not one conducive to the fastest upshifts.",1
"Combine the substantial feel of the shifts with the excellent engine note, solid, meaty steering and reasonably powerful brakes, and, the overall impression is one of distinctly non-agricultural engineering.",0
"The interior, as long as the options packages are taken ( and if youre spending over $ 20k, why not! ), is very good for a low-end  coupe.",1
"Surfaces are substantially less""plasticy"" than the new Celicas, with interesting shapes and flowing, well coordinated lines, while being more adventurous than the likes of the new Impreza.",0
"Touching surfaces, such as wheels and interior handles feel pleasantly solid, and flimsy paneling is saved for the bits you dont normally see or touch.",1
"Leather, though not exactly top-quality or extensively used, is infinitely preferable to the cheap n nasty Mitsubishi cloth.",1
"The Japanese should really leave velour to Saab, who know how to make it work.",0
"Interior room, though limited in the back, is decent.",0
"As with many such 3-doors, it s always better for the front-seaters, and bad elsewhere There is a distinct lack of headroom for any drivers over 6 feet tall ( strange, given the target market ), but windscreen rake is less aggressive than the atrocious Mustang, or even the Volvo V70.",0
However the lack of headroom and the large blind spot and rear pillars simply worsen the inherently poor all-around visibility.,0
"Reverse parking is quite tough unless seat belts are released, and the head is stuck right out of the window.",0
"Visibility down the nose is average or sub-average for tall drivers, who will have to keep their seat pretty close to the floor.",0
"And if you want to avoid side-swiping people, headrests must be kept firmly in their stowed position at all times.",0
Perhaps a pattern can be seen emerging?,0
"This is nt much of a sports car, but as long as you pay for the options, it s a good GT in the classic mould.",0
"Its a heavy car, with handsome looks, an engaging ( if not over-powerful ) big-hearted engine, a good ( factory option ) premium sound system, a solid feel at the controls, and good long-distance comfort and decent luggage space for 2.",1
"As such, it s best for munching miles in comfort, rather than attacking racetracks, backroads and highway on-ramps.",0
"But if you want to spend the money on that, why not stretch a bit further, and get a 325ci  a machine that delivers quality, luxury, handling, highway manners and looks to beat the Eclipse, for a small amount more.",1
"And if you like performance, youll more likely prefer either the raw uncontrollability of a true modern muscle-car, or the precision and ability of modern compacts like the RSX or Impreza.",0
"Now that the Xterra has been for sale a few years, Nissan has decided to freshen up the appearance to more closely mimic the stand-out styling of the Frontier pickup.",0
"The Xterra has always boasted rugged, chunky exterior styling, but the front end treatment lacked the edgy quality of the rest of the car.",0
"Now a more aggressive looking front fascia adorns the Xterra complete with round, almost oval shaped headlights, and a honeycomb type grille.",0
The 2002 Xterra is much more in keeping with how one might expect an off-road capable SUV to look.,0
"The interior has a sportier look as well; separate round, backlit gauges and a slightly more stylish center dash give the Xterras interior a youthful look.",0
The Xterra is now available with a supercharged V6 making 210 hp.,0
This a welcome addition as the normally aspirated V6 in the Xterra and Frontier makes a barely adequate 170 hp.,0
The supercharged engine in the Xterra is a first in its class.,0
The main advantage the Xterra has over its competition is size.,0
"Nissan calls the Xterra a compact SUV and it is the least expensive SUV offered by Nissan with prices starting at $ 18,000 for a 4-cylinder 4x2.",0
"However similar in price, the Xterras interior and exterior dimensions literally dwarf the Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4, Land Rover Freelander, and Subaru Forester.",0
Only the Hyundai Santa Fe comes close in terms of interior volume and overall size.,0
"Physically, the Xterra is more similar to mid-size SUVs like the Toyota Highlander or 4 Runner than any compact SUV.",0
"Cargo room in the Xterra is plentiful, fold the split rear seats down and there is even more room.",0
"Rear seats fold down easily, but do not fold all the way flat, a feature most other vehicles in this class have.",1
"If you still cant fit all your gear inside, the Xterras sizable roof rack can accommodate almost anything.",1
"The Xterra seems purpose built for exterior mounted, aftermarket travel containers.",0
"With the rear seats folded up, there is more than adequate room for adult passengers.",0
"Although there is plenty of leg room, there seems to be precious little foot space.",0
Nissan uses a type of theatre seating  wherein the rear passengers sit slightly higher than the front seat occupants.,0
"Its a great idea, but an unintended consequence is that rear seat passengers cannot get their feet to slide under the front seats.",1
Therefore the back seat feels more cramped than it really is.,0
"Front and rear seats are average in comfort  many Nissan cars and truck have comfortable and pleasant seating positions, this is true of the Xterra as well.",0
"Rear seats do not recline, but seem to be in a permanent partial reclining position.",1
"Some passengers like this, others thought it felt odd.",0
The Xterra also has the competition beat when it comes to towing capacity.,0
"An SUV based on a truck rather than a car may not offer a smooth ride, but boy can it tow.",1
"With a towing capacity of 3500 lbs., the SE S/C Xterra can out-tow virtually every vehicle in its class with the exception of the Jeep Liberty.",0
In many cases the Xterra is able to handle from 1500 to 2800 lbs more than other SUVs like the Ford Escape and Hyundai Santa Fe.,0
"If you must have 3500 lbs towing capacity AND the ability to traverse rugged terrain, the Nissan Xterra has you covered.",0
"But if you want a decent handling, drivable family vehicle with a civilized ride, then scratch the Xterra off your shopping list.",0
"The Xterra is a body-on-frame vehicle  in short, it is a truck.",0
"Most body-on-frame vehicles are not known for their refined highway manners, but the Xterra is probably the worst of the worst.",1
Chevrolets Tahoe and Suburban utilize body-on-frame construction and the ride on those vehicles is actually quite pleasant.,0
Even the smallest of pot-hole or uneven pavement upset the Xterras ride.,0
This truck squirms and shakes and shimmies like nobodys business.,0
This is true at both low speeds and higher speeds.,0
A 15mph trip down an alley ( in less than average condition ) resulted in so much teeth clattering shake I almost returned home to get another car.,0
"I drive every test vehicle down this same alley, and never have I experienced so much discomfort.",1
Everytime I drove this truck I could nt help but think of the old 60s song Like I do. ,0
Nobody can do the Shake; Like I do.,0
Nobody can do the Shimmy; Like I do.,0
"Nobody can do the boogaloo; Like I do   And that is exactly what Xterra is capable of, it can shake and shimmy and bump and jostle like no other car I know.",1
Even the lowly Suzuki Vitara feels a tad bit more stable.,0
All this shaking and bouncing revealed several interior squeaks and rattles.,0
"When unoccupied,the passenger seat-back vibrates back and forth terribly.",0
Rough roads are cause for concern as the Xterra often felt like it was dog-tracking  or driving slightly sideways whenever uneven pavement or large dips were encountered.,0
"Its difficult to keep in just one lane, and the steering is vague and incommunicative.",0
I often felt like I was in danger due to the fact that the Xterra would rarely respond the way I expected.,0
"On straight, smooth roads the Xterra has a tendency to wander.",0
Constant input to the steering wheel is needed to keep this truck on the straight and narrow.,0
"The only plus in the handling department is the Xterras relatively small turning radius, this proved helpful in tight parking lots and garages.",0
"Although the 210 hp is a welcome addition to the Xterra, the vehicle does nt seem to be able to effectively handle that much power.",1
"During hard acceleration, the Xterra would lift and twist and end up pointed in some direction I never intended.",1
"Even thought he Xterra is a rear-wheel drive vehicle, it felt like it was suffering from front-wheel drive torque-steer  as this is with the 4-wheel drive disengaged.",0
"Acceleration is better than average, but lacks the brute force expected from a 3.3L, supercharged V6.",0
"The 6 does take a few seconds to catch its breath, but once the supercharger is really pumping, there is a noticeable surge forward that only seems to grow stronger as the revs climb higher.",0
Maximum output is at 4800 RPM.,0
"There is bit of whine from the supercharger once it gets wound up, it s hardly intrusive, but still noticeable.",0
"Even with the 210 hp, the S/C Xterra could still use a few more ponies, even the normally aspirated Altima 3.5 makes 30 more hp than the supercharged Xterra.",0
"Still, the supercharged Xterra offers more power than vehicles such as the Mazda Tribute V6, Hyundai Santa Fe V6, and Toyota RAV which is only available as a 4-cylinder.",0
The much pricier Toyota Highlander with a V6 makes only 10 more hp but can cost thousands more when ordered with a few basic options.,0
"Bringing the Xterra to stop is drama-free in most cases, but in panic stop situations, the Xterra nose-dives terribly.",0
"In heavy traffic, low speed short-stops are common.",0
"In this situation, the Xterras brakes feel touchy and the vehicle rocks back and forth once it comes to a full stop.",0
Rear brakes are drum type  are they kidding with this thing?,0
Who wants to pay as much as $ 27K for an SUV with drum brakes.,0
"I can understand it on the $ 18,000 4-cylinder version, but not on the supercharged 4x4.",1
"Other problems with the Xterra included: outside window molding with excessive gaps, disconcerting rattle from under the vehicle when driving ( even at low speeds ) on rough pavement, excessive play in the steering, no vanity mirror on either passenger or driver side sunvisors, and a passenger's seat that squeaked constantly whenever it was unoccupied.",1
"Finally, due to the Xterras weight ( 4229 lbs. ) and its thirsty supercharged engine, fuel mileage is a miserable 15 mpg city / 18 mpg highway.",0
This puts the S/C Xterra in league with a bigger V8 powered SUV like the Chevy Tahoe which makes 75 more horsepower.,0
"If you value fuel economy, opt for the Xterra XE with the 2.4L engine.",0
I used a half tank of gas in just three days of normal commute driving.,0
"Yes the freeways in Los Angeles are crowded, but my office is 8 miles away from my home.",0
Add a few side trips to the store or lunch and that still does not equal a half tank of fuel gone.,1
"Overall, the 2002 Nissan Xterra XE S/C is a mixed bag, but the bottom line is that I simply can not recommend this car.",1
"Granted, it is a stellar off-road performer and can tow more weight than almost all others in its class, plus holds a bunch of cargo inside and on the hefty roof rack.",0
But the shortcomings are just too much to overcome.,0
"A vehicle like the Land Rover Freelander has a lot of negative aspects to it as well, but at the end of the day, it is a car that most people could live with and enjoy.",0
"A rugged, good looking truck, the Xterra is just that, a truck  and a sloppy one to boot.",0
"Car based SUVs offer superior comfort and drivability, but lack the Xterras truck like qualities  both good and bad.",0
"Expect retail pricing on the Xterra to start at $ 18,000 and run all the way up to $ 27,000 for a 4x4 SE supercharged V6.",0
"Anyone looking to spend $ 27,000 or more on an SUV should seriously consider the Nissan Pathfinder, Mazda Tribute, Toyota Highlander, or Chevy Tahoe.",0
"Unless youre running the Paris  Dakar rally, skip the Xterra.",0
"Review of my 2002 Nissan Altima SE 3.5, black on black.",0
"I brought this car new Feb 28, 2002 with 256 miles on it.",0
I had originally wanted a Maxima to replace my 1998 SE model which was going off of lease and had to be replaced.,0
"But as it was near the end of the month, there wasn't anyone among 4 different dealers who could find a 2002 Maxima SE with the right combination of options and color that I wanted in California or Nevada.",0
That's the problem with option packages.,0
"Unless you want to special order and wait, you are going to settle for what the dealer has or can get.",0
"So although""option"" may imply choice, you really don't have much choice at all.",0
"OTOH, when you buy a Honda or Acura, there are no options except color.",1
"Everything is standard and all the cars have the same""options"".",0
So I settled on an Altima.,0
I had tested this car back in October on an invite from Nissan and was impressed with the power and looks.,0
The car has every option offered except for the xenon headlights.,0

"Superficially, the car is fast and handles reasonably well.",0
It's very easy to hit 90 mph [grin].,0
Car lines look good.,0
Outward view is OK but the roof pillars do get in the way during certain maneuvers and during angle parking.,0
"I could focus on the good points of the car like so many others but that side of the story has been covered ad infinitum by the car magazines, newspaper supplements and professional car reviewers, so I will focus on the shortcomings and design flaws.",0
Why?,0
Because the bottom line is that it is the weaknesses that will bother you most when living with a car over a period of time.,0
"Like the Chinese water torture, a few small things, over a period of time can drive you crazy.",0
And there are a lot of small things that taken together make for an annoying experience.,0
"IMO, Nissan has cut a LOT of corners on the 2002 Altima.",0
"This might be acceptable to meet financial constraints in a 15-20k car, but is inexcusable in an approximately 30k ( list ) car.",0
Perhaps the mistake that Nissan has made is to try to bring the car upscale too fast by offering the expensive 6 cylinder model.,0
"In the 4 cylinder econo-car class, the Altima would probably be a very acceptable package priced at say 19-22k max.",0
"Were I in Nissan management, I would not have offered the 6-cylinder model leaving that to the Maxima line.",1
"So remember, my comments below are directed strictly at the top of the line SE 3.5 model.",0
"After living with this car for one month, I've discovered a LOT of design deficiencies, poor design choices and extensive corner cutting in materials.",0
"You can call me anal for the list below, but I contend that the designers SHOULD have been even more so.",0
"In this day of computer design and with so many fine examples to copy from, is it unreasonable to expect that a 30k car would be designed with considerable thought and ergonomic considerations?",0
Many of the complaints below could have easily been rectified at little ( or even no ) additional cost given proper forethought.,1
"Instead, it seems like they put the"" B"" design team on the Altima project with [hopefully ] the"" A"" guys sent to work on the new"" Z"" car.",0
"-Interior design and material quality is equivalent to a cheaper car, say one costing maybe 15k.",0
The interior is unrelenting stark.,0

"Instead of a nice smooth finish, look closely and you can see the undulations and uneveness of the paint job.",0

-Heated seats switches are on the console behind the driver's hands and out of sight.,0
You have to look down and back to see them buried by the center console box.,0

"To get to the window controls, you have to slide your arm backward and take your eyes off the road or feel around for them.",0

-Car has the Bose stereo with 6 CD slot-type radio.,0
"But there is no way to lock the eject button to protect from a parking attendant, mechanic, etc. stealing one or more of the CD's.",1
"Of course, you probably wouldn't notice one CD was missing until sometime after you left the lot.",0
-I don't like these slot type 6 CD changers.,0
It's annoying to sit there and load or unload all 6 CD's.,0
"Obviously, Bose hasn't given any thought to how best to do this task.",1
"As it stands now, you have to select the CD's you want in your house.",0
You can either load them into a carrier to bring them to the car or carry them to the car in their jewel cases.,0
"Then you have to remove them from the jewel cases or the carrier and insert them into the CD player, one by one.",0
Then you can put the jewel cases in the glove box or center console.,0
"You can't put the carrier in the console box because it won't fit, so it has to go in the glove box.",0
"Hopefully, you don't have any gloves or other stuff in there.",0
Seems to me that it would make more sense to have a CD cartridge like I've had with the trunk mounted units previously.,0
You can load one or two of these up in the house so as not to have to mess around with individual CD's while sitting in the car.,1
"Better yet, the cartridge should fit into a slot in the dashboard on in the radio ( rather than the trunk ).",0
"Then when you leave your car with someone else ( that you didn't trust ), you could just pop the cartridge out of the dash and take it with you, addressing the possible issue with CD theft.",0
#NAME?,0

"At an indicated 80 mph I'm at about 2800 rpm, though this is difficult to pinpoint exactly given the poor granularity on the speedo.",0
"And since the speedometer may be high by 8-12 mph, this could actually be the RPM at 70 mph.",0

There should be removable dividers so you can segregate the storage for holding a variety of items.,0
-Main console box should be another 1/2 to 1 inch deep.,0
"This is where you store your CD cases and if you don't fit them in nearly perfectly, the console top won't close.",1
"This is, of course, difficult with all the other stuff we carry around in there ( welcome to the real world... ).",0
"If you load the CD's into a carrying case, it won't fit in the box either, even if it is clean of other things.",0
-There should be a lock on the console box since you may have CD's or a phone in there.,0

But it really isn't.,0
"One, extending the top forward interferes with any water bottles in the cup holes in front.",0
"Two, when the top is extended, it is too high to rest your arm on AND work the automatic shifter comfortably.",0
"-With the Maxima, when you get the leather upgrade BOTH the driver and passenger seats are 8 way power.",0
Here the passenger seat is totally manual.,0
-Headrests don't tilt.,0
-Hood doesn't have a hydraulic support.,0

"After all, this is a 30k car...",0
"---April 3, 2002 update---",0
Using a GPS unit I have verified that the speedo is off by between ~3.5 to 5 mph toward the plus side.,0
"For instance, an indicated 70 mph is about actual 67.2 mph +-.5 mph.",0
"An indicated 85 mph is actual 80.5 mph This is about a 4-6 % error which I assume is within spec for a non-calibrated, mass produced mechanical device.",0
I now have 1475 miles on the car and the last gas fill-up covering 308 mostly highway miles shows an average mpg of 18.94 ( spreadsheet calculation ).,0
"The car computer is showing 21.2 mpg, an 11 % error.",0
"Since the computer calculation for mpg is wrong, the associated calculation for tank time to empty is also wrong.",0
I noted that the empty light came on the tank with ~3.5 gallons left in the tank.,0
"---August 10, 2002 update---",0
I now have about 6500 miles on the car.,0
"On the positive side, I have to say that I really like the looks and people still look at it as I pass them by.",0
"Having the sunroof windshield ( fairly useless ), rear spoiler and alloy wheels really makes for a nice profile.",0
"Parked next to a 2.5, the 3.5 looked a lot better.",0
"Other than the airbag sensor replacement, I haven't had any major problems.",0
"Unlike the Edmund test car and others, I haven't had any problems with speaker rattling or the stereo unit getting too hot.",0
There aren't any squeaks or rattles yet.,0
There is a vibration that feels like the tires out of balance when the car is cold and I am on the highway.,0
But this clears up when the car warms up.,0
Weird.,0
I did a comprehensive test on the cars speedometer accuracy vs. a GPS unit in 5 mph increments.,0
I had the car all the way up to 115 mph on 280 in CA [g].,0
"On average the speedometer is 2-4 mph over actual speed, which is acceptable.",0
"As an aside, with GPS technology being so cheap, it would seem only a matter of time until car manufacturers start including on-the-road GPS speedometer calibration as a feature.",0
Expect to see this first on the high-end Mercedes and BMW's.,0
Gas mileage for 80 % highway ( aggressive driving ) on the last tankfull is 19.78 mpg.,0
"The computer is indicating 21.4 mpg, a 7.58 % difference.",0
Mileage over the life of ownership is 19.33 mpg.,0
I switched to Red Line synthetic motor oil ( should last 15-20k between changes ) and put in a KandN air filter to replace the factory unit.,0

Not so on the Altima.,1
"When I turn this on, it spews hot air.",0
"The dealer measured the temperature and found it to be 90 degrees F when outside air temperature was about 60 degrees F. Initially, they thought it was defective but then contacted Nissan, who told them that it was working properly!",0
Apparently pushing this button is the equivalent of a fresh air vent ( what makes it different than just using the fan then? ) and does not engage the air conditioner.,1
"However, in the Altima design, the dealer tells me that air is drawn from vents on the firewall of the car, which means that you are drawing in hot air.",0
This would explain the high temperature output.,0
I think Nissan screwed up royally on this but is too stubborn to admit it.,0
"So it becomes a""feature"".",0
Must be reading the Microsoft playbook...,0
"---March 15, 20032 update---",0
I now have just over 14k on the car.,0
#NAME?,0
This is likely due to wear on the tires and seals.,0
#NAME?,0
They are going to pull the whole seat next week and see if they can secure or buffer the plastic better.,0
#NAME?,0
#NAME?,0
Anything over the first speed is very noticeable.,0
#NAME?,0
I guess that means that it was designed to work poorly.,0
- I'm noticing more auto transmission lag (2-3 seconds ) now when I stomp on the accelerator.,0
Dealer says normal.,0
"Given the deteriorating roads in the SF Bay Area ( due to the states 35 BILLION dollar budget shortfall ), the car is running OK and holding together reasonably well",0
"For 2002, Acura gives the Type-S treatment to its formerly bland TL sedan.",0
"Now you dont have to buy a coupe to get the 260 horsepower engine, 17 wheels, and sportier interior that have made the CL Type-S so popular.",0
"With a price of $ 31,700, the TL Type-S continues Acuras more stuff for less money  strategy.",0
The TL Type-S offers more power and more room for much less money than a BMW 330i or Lexus IS300.,0
Does this make it a genuine bargain among sports sedans?,0
"Since this is the category I am personally most interested in, I took an extended test drive to find out.",0
Styling and Accommodations,0
Ive never been a huge fan of the TLs exterior styling.,1
But maybe it was just the fussy wheels that came with the basic TL its first few years.,0
"The Type-Ss larger, thick-spoked wheels bring out the slightly aggressive quality previously hidden in the TLs angular lines.",0
"While the car is still short of striking, in this incarnation I could easily live with it.",0
The TLs interior has always been a great place to sit.,0
"The driving position is excellent, with the very low dash typical of Hondas.",0
I have never liked the much taller instrument panel found in BMWs and Audis.,1
"The front seats are very supportive, with excellent lateral support.",0
The rear seats are just roomy enough for my 59 frame.,0
A bump on the leading edge of the cushion provides better than average but still not ideal thigh support.,1
"The interior details added by the Type-Schampagne instrument faces, perforations in the leather, and, with the ebony interior, smoke-colored simulated woodlend a sporty look to the excellent interior of the standard TL.",0
I personally prefer lighter-colored interiors.,0
One problem with this in the Type-S is that the parchment interior has the standard simulated wood.,0
Its shade is far too orange for my taste.,0
And there is a ton of it.,0
The trunk is at best average in size on paper but appears fairly large and usefully shaped.,0
"Unfortunately, the rear seats do not fold down.",1
Only a pass through is provided.,0
"I have used the fold down rear seats many times in my own car, and would greatly miss this feature.",0
On the Road,0
"First, the good part.",0
The engine is magnificent.,0
It feels powerful and sounds great throughout its range.,0
"If anything the tuning of the throttle and torque converter are too aggressive, as I chirped the tires at only part throttle a few times.",0
"The manual feature of the standard automatic transmission is easy to use, and reacts as quickly as most of these.",0
I used it to hold second or third while aggressively driving the curvy roads in an industrial park.,0
"Still, Id really, really rather have a manual transmission, which would provide a much more direct connection to the engine.",0
"Alas, one is not offered, a shock given the fact that Honda once sold most of its cars with manuals.",1
"Update: It seems Acura is going to make a real manual available later in the year in the CL-S, and maybe later in the TL-S.",0
I'll be sure to test it once it's available.,0
To this point Im very pleased with the car.,0
"Unfortunately, in the areas of ride and handling it has a number of major flaws.",0
Torque steer often rears its ugly head.,0
"When accelerating, the front end feels light and the steering gets squirrelly.",0
There are some good aspects of the handling.,0
"The tires stick well, and when not accelerating the steering provides good feedback.",1
"The stability control does not cut in too early, unlike most such systems.",1
But the TL Type-S remains less than eager to turn in.,0
"It lacks the tossable feel present in a BMW 3-Series, or even in my lowly Ford Contour.",0
"Strangely enough, Ive noticed the same problems in the Oldsmobile Aurora and Cadillac Deville.",0
It is possible that channeling a ton or power through the front wheels has its trade-offs.,0
The 2002 Maxima and I30 will be similarly powerful.,0
Im now eager to see if they will have the same problems.,0
All of this is nothing compared to the ride.,0
"Its just plain awful, worse than anything Ive driven in recent memory.",0
The Type-S reacted sharply to just about every imperfection it encountered in the road.,0
"I thought my Contour SE, with a very stiff suspension, rode poorly, but driving home from the dealer I suddenly realized that the ride just sounds bad; you hear more than you actually feel while hitting bumps and potholes.",0
In the Acura these were both heard and felt.,0
"If anything, the ride resembled that of a 1980s GM sedan with the performance suspension option.",0
"Back then, GM thought that a performance suspension had to ride like hell, and those in its sedans did.",0
"Given the degree of jittering I sensed, I suspect that the TLs structure is also more flexible than most in this class, further degrading the ride.",0
"Overall, the Type-Ss ride felt inappropriate for this class of car, and perhaps for anything short of an all-out sports car.",0
"If this translated to phenomenal handling, it might almost be forgivable, but it does nt, so it is nt.",1
"All of the competition rides better, and most of it handles better as well.",0
Update: Xorg in his own excellent review says that the hard ride I experienced might be caused by overinflated tires.,0
They ship at 40 psi ( as is standard practice for all cars--reduces bouncing on the rail car and truck ) and sometimes the dealers forget to deflate them to 32 psi.,0
"I wouldn't expect this to make that large of a difference, but it would certainly make some difference.",0
You'd think that when I complained about the ride the salespeople would have checked this.,0
But that's assuming they have brains...,0
Only a test drive with a tire gauge would really solve this.,0
"At any rate, when you test drive this car be sure to have the tire pressure checked.",0
It might significantly affect your evaluation of the car.,0
"Update 2: I still have not driven a second TL-S, but based on comments from owners in Autoweek and a review in Consumer Reports ( Feburary 2002 issue ) I suspect that my evaluation was not based on overinflated tires.",1
"CR is meticulous about setting tire pressure accurately, yet complained about a"" jittery"" ride, even on smooth surfaces.",0
They also felt the car did not handle all that well.,1
"People see the horsepower and price tag of this car and, consciously or unconsciously, they reject any evidence that this car might have some weaknesses.",0
Sorry to burst your bubble.,0
Last Words,0
"A 260 horsepower engine and 17 performance tires do not a BMW killer make, even if the price appears to be amazingly low.",1
"The basic car, derived from the Accord, is simply not up to this mission.",1
"Given the pattern of the cars faults, Im beginning to wonder if Honda hired all of those engineers that took early retirement from GM in the early 90s.",0
"Flinty ride, torque steer, overly fake wood, flimsy structure, an attempt to cover all of this up with great statstheyre all here.",0
"Its a shame, because the world really needs a great high performance sedan for around $ 30,000.",0
Is anyone listening?,0
"Till then looks like the best bet is a used 3 or, for less money but also less refinement ( sometimes chassis imperfections are fun ), a Nissan Maxima",0
"My neighbor bought one of these, the sport model.",0
"I'd seen them before out on the road and I always thought they looked cheap, almost plastic like... First off the colors they offer....blech....to make a cheap product look nice they should offer something nicer than maroon.",0
"NOt to hurt my neighbors feelings even when they thought they had bought a top of the line product I just kind of shrugged and said it was""nice"".",1
"My first thought was, morons, should've bought an Odyssey or a Windstar or even a Quest.",0
I think that most people that buy the Villager really want a Quest but just can't afford one.,0
So my neighbor took me for a spin in her new van.,0
The door handle felt just like I suspected...cheap like I could just twist it right off the van...,0
The seat felt like I was sitting on a tower with the windshield against my face.,0
I swear I could see my breath's on the windsheild while she drove.,0
"There was no center console, a big drawback in my opinion and something that should be standard on a more than basic model.",1
"The controls were all handy but again, cheap looking.",0
The interior was very drab and the seat covers covered up that mistake well.,0
The ride was very stiff and loud and the acceleration seemed sluggish.,0
I did not feel safe at all in this van.,1
I'd say the back seating was sufficient except for the very back seat.,0
There did not seem to be much leg room.,1
What did I like?,0
The trunk and back window.,0
YOu can open the trunk completely or just the window.,0
There is a handy shelf system but it's made of plastic and I feel this will probably break after a while somehow.,0
I also like the length of the vehicle.,0
It would probably be easy to move from a sedan to this vehicle and wouldn't take long to get used to it.,0
I've seen a lot of these Villager's out on the road and I've noticed they don't hold their shiney integrity once they're a year old or so.,0
"They start to look, cheap, the paint dulls right up and the two tone models just exagerate this even more in my opinion.",0
"They show scuffs and scratches very easily, maybe it is the quality of paint they use?",0
I'd say pass this vehicle up.,0
"It did not do well at all on crash tests and for what my neighbor paid ( $ 28,000 ) they could have gotten an a lot nicer minivan.",1
"In my opinion, steer clear of this van.",0
You'll be dissatisfied in the long run.,0
"And never pay more than $ 22,000 if you have to have one.",1
"As the saying goes, you get what you pay for!",0
"You know youre in trouble when, after driving a certain car for just three days, you find yourself desperately looking for something to like about that car.",0
Gear shifter looks cool the reasoning begins.,0
"But alas, it just is not mean to be  the Mercury Cougar is simply not a great car.",1
"The trouble with the Cougar is that it is a perfectly fine car when judged on its own merits  adequate power, distinct styling, plenty of options etc., but it falls short when one considers the vehicles that the Cougar is competing against  VW Turbo Beetle, VW GTI, Dodge Stratus Coupe.",0
"Frankly there is little reason to choose the Cougar when shopping for a sporty coupe in the $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 range.",0
"Cougars of past have been big, luxury cars, or high powered muscle cars.",0
This Cougar is neither.,1
It is front-wheel drive and a V8 engine is nowhere to be found.,0
"Without the badges, youd be hard pressed to figure out that this is a Cougar.",1
"Not so with many other Ford products; Mustang, Thunderbird, F-150.",1
They all look like what they are.,0
"Even if you dont know the first thing about cars, a Mustang still looks like a Mustang.",1
"The Cougar XR (essentially an appearance package on the Sport ) offers many standard features: V6, 6-disc, in-dash CD changer, leather seating, traction control, split folding rear seat, air-conditioning etc.",0
"The outside is jazzed up with a hood scoop, rear spoiler, 16 inch alloys, and fog lights.",0
There is actually quite a lot of stuff packed into this little car considering the price.,0
XR Cougars come with special logos on the door pillars and floor mats.,0
"Coming soon; a 35th anniversary edition  you guessed it, just another appearance package.",0
"The Cougar is not without its strong points, mainly, stand-out exterior styling and an interior to match.",1
The Mercury Cougar is a good looking sporty coupe.,0
Its edgy styling gets noticed in a crowd.,0
"Certainly styling is subjective, and the Cougar is proof  many feel the Cougar is nothing less than the very definition of ugly.",0
"Whatever your perspective, youd have to admit it is different looking.",0
"Note to Ford: The Cougar is not a half-bad looking car, loose the fake hood scoop FAST!",0
"So many modern cars lure us with their rakish good looks on the outside, only to fall short once were inside the car.",0
"Not so with the Cougar, the edgy styling theme continues inside the Cougar with metallic looking surfaces and racy gauges.",1
"Aftermarket style pedals, chrome accent door sills, sport seats with body color inserts, bucket rear seats, and an elegant but simple door panel design continue the style-fest inside.",0
"Other features worth mention inside Cougar XR include: split folding rear seat, rear seat cup holder, 6-disc in-dash CD changer, power drivers seat with height adjustment, and high quality leather seating.",0
And that is where the praise ends  a simple summation of all the Cougars strong points could easily be stated as such; looks cool inside and out.,0
"Although the interior is great looking, it is essential useless for carrying more than two people.",0
"Rear seats are for kids only, and even the front seats can seem cramped times.",0
A cup holder for the back seat is thoughtful feature.,0
"Storage space up front is limited, and what storage containers there are feel cheap and plasticky.",0
The glove box alone seems as if the hard plastic it is made of may break with just one overly assertive slam.,0
"Switchgear feels durable, but lacks the ergonomic correctness of many Japanese cars.",0
On the road the Cougar handles well.,0
"In fact, at times, the Cougar can be downright fun.",0
"The P215/50R16 tires provide more than adequate grip when carving up back roads, and traction control is a welcome addition on a budget priced car.",0
"On paper, the Cougar seems to have it all, but in the real world just ok  comes to mind.",0
Road noise is unacceptably high on all but the smoothest streets.,0
"Certainly no one would expect a $ 20,000 sporty coupe to feel like a Lexus, but the harshness of the Cougars ride is enough to make an owner want to avoid long trips.",1
Compare this to a car like the VW GTI where road trips are a welcome excuse for some extended seat time.,0
Even the Dodge Stratus has more pleasant road manners on the open highway.,0
Engine noise is pronounced as well.,0
"Yes, it is great that the Cougar is available with a V6, but that 170 hp V6 is noisy and unrefined, running through the gears would be so much more rewarding if the noise level was kept down.",0
"Power is adequate, but no more.",1
An imprecise shift linkage saps some of the driving fun.,0
Further sapping any fun one might wish for with the Cougar is balky and jolting experience which results from driving the 5-speed with the A/C on.,0
"The compressor switching on and off so taxes the engine that a jolt, or slight buck results  not fun!",1
"Again, a car like the Dodge Stratus boasts a more refined engine and transmission.",0
Even the 4-cylidner version of the Stratus is less abrasive than the V6 version of the Cougar.,0
"The Cougar is available with a 4-cylinder engine as well, but given the barely adequate performance of the V6, one cant help but feel skeptical about viability of the 4-cylinder version in everyday driving situations.",0
A bright spot in the Cougars power train is fuel economy.,0
The 2002 Cougars 2.5L DOHC V6 has an estimated 30 mpg highway and 21 city  not bad for a little V6.,1
"When all is said and done, the Mercury Cougar is a car with a few bright spots, but is generally quite lack-luster overall.",0
"The Cougar is an attractive looking sporty coupe, with many features at a reasonable price.",0
"The main drawbacks are: lack of refinement in the engine and transmission, a noisy cabin, and a rather small interior.",0
"While no one can argue with the fun of a V6 hooked up to a 5-speed manual, there are plenty of other cars that offer twice the fun, and twice the refinement at about the same price.",0
"If one is shopping for a new car and the Cougar is the first car they drive, it will most likely impress.",0
"But, as soon as that same shopper drives a VW GTI, the Cougar will be but a distant memory.",0
"Fitting, because the Cougar will soon be a distant memory for us all  Mercury will no longer make the current Cougar after the 2002 model year.",1
"And frankly, it s easy to see why.",0
"Two weeks ago, I spent several days behind the wheel of a 2002 Ford Taurus SE (you can see a review based on my week in a Taurus at http://www.epinions.com/content_47170162308",0
")./SYM Lo and behold, when I picked up a rental car the next week, the kind folks at my neighborhood Enterprise handed me the keys to a Mercury Sable.",0
"Over the next five days, I put slightly under 500 miles on the vehicle; the bulk of which was highway driving.",0
The Car,0
"Enterprise rented me a 2002 Sable GS model, a four-door, with Lincoln-Mercury's stock V6 Vulcan engine and four-speed automatic overdrive transmission.",0
"The vehicle came equipped with dual airbags, power doors/windows/mirrors, cloth seats, AM/FM/Cassette, tilt wheel, cruise control, intermittent wipers, and AC.",0
This model (unlike last week's Taurus ) also included remote keyless entry.,0
Styling Notes,0
"This particular Sable was supplied in a metallic champagne color with a three-color interior package in kahki and gold, with a deep olive shade for the dashboard and steering wheel.",0
"The trunk, however, is carpeted in the same gray as the Taurus.",0
Much of the difference ( what little there is ) between a Taurus and a Sable is in the styling.,0
"Given that Ford positions Lincoln-Mercury as their luxury line, the carmaker feels compelled to give the Sable a more luxurious look and feel than the proletarian Taurus.",0
"Since frame and body components of the two vehicles are identical, any additional""luxury"" must be imparted by changes in pieces and parts that are inserted, attached, or otherwise appended to the core of the automobile.",0
"That, for the most part, means additional chrome: the Sable's grille has a chrome surround ( reminiscent of the Jaguar grille ) and the body trim molding boasts a chrome insert instead of the plain color-matched molding on the Taurus.",0
Head - and tail-lights are subtly different; the Sable's lighting modules have a more traditional appearance lacking the elongate teardrop motif of the Taurus.,0
The most striking body difference is in the trunkline.,0
"The Sable's trunk bears the slightest suggestion of a bulge at the rear, with the addition of a chrome emblem on the rear-facing surface to suggest the classic Lincoln Continental.",0
"Interior styling for the Sable has likewise been dialed up a notch, with the addition of a snazzy two-tone dashboard.",0
"A luxury note is added by the faux walnut surround on the central panel, viewing which makes me wonder: is there but one supplier for fake burled walnut in the world, or does everybody make that same color and pattern of ugly plastic?",0
"The instrument cluster remains unchanged, as does the central panel containing the climate control and entertainment centers.",0
The radio controls feature the same tired black rocker switches used in the Taurus; the climate control is the stock three-knob system used by Ford for decades ( an automatic temperature-control system is optional ).,0
Driver-Car Interface,0
"The Sable's ride differs marginally from the Taurus, perhaps as a result of slightly different tuning in the suspension to impart the more""luxurious"" ride.",0
"Cornering and braking, as in the Taurus, are acceptable but unremarkable.",0
"The overall ride is comfortable on smooth roads, with a slight sway on bumpy or uneven surfaces.",0
The stock 155-hp Vulcan V6 is the same engine used in the SE model Taurus; it suffers the same acceptable high-end torque and deficient low-end acceleration I noted in the Sable's twin.,0
"As in the Taurus SE, the engine was coupled to a four-speed automatic overdrive transmission ( steering column-mounted ).",0
"My mileage on this trip came in at 22 MPG, much the same as my experience in the Taurus.",0
"The cockpit, too, is identical to that of the Taurus, with controls and switches arrayed within comfortable reach of the averaged-sized driver ( me ).",0
"An available pedal placement control option, which raises and lowers the accelerator/brake pedal complex, might prove useful to shorter drivers.",0
"The Sable, like the Taurus, provides illumination in the door and window controls so that they can be found in the dark.",0
Driving Environment,0
Seating in this trim level of the Sable is identical to that of the Taurus SE; with comfortable but unremarkable cloth seats.,0
"The GS, like the Taurus SE, lacks motor-driven seat adjustment and also has minimal lumbar support.",0
"Rear-seat room is sufficient for three average-sized passengers, though all three would find the configuration uncomfortable for more than an hour or so of riding.",0
The glove compartment is of a reasonable size and lacks the somewhat strange shape of that found in the Taurus.,0
"There are map pockets in the door ( no surprise ) and a small cubbyhole for change, or other small items below the climate controls.",1
"Like the Taurus SE, the Sable GS provides two frnt""bucket-like"" seats plus that same idiotic convertible console/armrest that can be folded up to form a middle front seat.",0
"It may be""luxurious,"" but it's still stupid -- the cupholders and console storage disappear instantly when it's folded, and folding or unfolding the lower half requires removing whatever's plugged into either power port.",0
"The trunk capacity is, like that of the Taurus, about 17 cubic feet and has an moderately high sill.",0
"Unlike the Taurus, there is no cargo net, but there are two small plastic wells molded into the floor at the sides of the space.",1
"At the GS trim level, the back seats do not fold nor is there any form of pass-through; long cargo must either hang over the trunk lip or be relegated to the roof.",1
"Wind noise is very pronounced at highway speeds, even moreso than in the Taurus.",0
"Engine noise is somewhat intrusive, although road noise is minimal unless the road surface is especially coarse ( fresh chip-and-seal surfaces, for instance ).",0
Highs and Lows,0
"These are my personal observations about this Sable model, with additional explanation where necessary:",0
Positives: the Accelerator Pedal,0
+/SYM good rear-seat room,0
+/SYM large trunk capacity,0
+/SYM clear dash and instrument-panel layout,0

On Quality,0
"This particular Sable was not as poorly constructed as the Taurus I drove last week ( ergo the 3-star rating as opposed to the Taurus's 2-star ), but there is still room for improvement.",1
Quality problems I noted in a cursory inspection included:,0
- The fuel gage does not read above 7/8 even when full ( same as I observed in the Taurus -- a supplier problem? ),1
- The two-tone dashboard is actually one piece; and the boundary between the two color areas was irregular,0
#NAME?,0
Rant,0
"One area in which the Taurus and the Sable ( and other Ford products, if I remember correctly ) are deficient -- in my humble opinion -- is in the climate control engineering.",0
"There are three knobs for this system: fan speed, temperature, and a""position"" selector.",0
"Other manufacturers give you the option for recirculate vs external circulation in any position ( face, floor, defrost ) and with the AC on or off; in a Ford it's only available in AC.",0
When on AC ( or Max AC ) you have to play with the vents to balance air in the face or on the floor.,0
Other manufacturers give us control over whether the AC unit is running in any vent position and also over the circulation in any vent position.,0
Why won't Ford's engineers do the same?,0
Overall,0
"There's not a dime's worth of difference between the Sable GS and the Taurus GE in the realm of engineering, handling, and comfort.",1
"The minor differences in styling are insignificant to the intrinsic value of the car, but are there only to add a taste of""luxury,"" so they're worth it, I guess.",0
"If you don't mind paying an extra $ 200 or so ( base price Taurus SE vs base price Sable GS ) for the chrome trim and that fake walnut on the dashboard, feel free to pony it up.",1
"Or if your Lincoln-Mercury dealer is much more convenient than your Ford dealer, it's a no-brainer.",0
"Otherwise, shop'em both and see who'll give you the best deal.",0
"Or you could buy a Camry, instead -- and get a dish of Japanese-flavored plain vanilla instead of US-flavored plain vanilla.",0
"I rented a PT Cruiser for a weekend trip from Vancouver, BC to Sooke on Vancouver Island, so my review is not based on long-term ownership.",1
"However, approximately 300 miles of city and highway driving did give me a good feel for the Cruiser's strengths and weaknesses.",0
"On the plus side, the exterior styling is certainly distinctive.",0
Overall I think it works well and is evidence of a strong commitment to design at Chrysler.,0
"Inside, the driving position is almost perfect, and although the driver's seat in the model I drove did not adjust for height, it was extremely easy to get comfortable.",1
"The Cruiser's ride is smooth, soaking up the potholes and uneven surfaces of Vancouver Island's roads with ease.",0
"Luggage space, too, is a strong point, with lots of room underneath the rear hatchback, and useful storage trays.",0
"Negatives, unfortunately, outweigh the positives, at least on the model I drove.",0
"I say unfortunately because I wanted to like this car enough to recommend it, and I'm always glad to see North American manufacturers make a genuine attempt to produce innovative designs.",0
"The biggest issue may be resolved by going for the five speed manual, but the automatic model I drove was seriously hampered by a transmission that always seemed to be in the wrong gear, took ages to downshift, and left the car struggling on steep inclines.",0
"Fifteen years ago, an autobox this poor may have been the norm, but in 2002 it's unacceptable.",0
"Many manufacturers, including Honda, Toyota and VW, offer far superior automatic transmissions, even on their low end models.",0
"That said, if I get the chance to drive a five speed model any time soon, I'll update my review accordingly.",0
"Handling is only average, with some significant body roll and steering that is all but absent of feel or accuracy.",0
"Perhaps handling quality has been sacrificed at the expense of the smooth ride, but many other manufacturers seem able to balance these qualities far more effectively.",0
"Forward visibility is excellent, thanks in part to the upright driving position and large, steeply-angled windshield.",0
"However, shoulder-checking to change lanes or pass reveals a significant blind spot caused by the thick rear pillars.",0
"The large exterior mirrors help to a certain extent, but they also seem to generate a lot of wind noise at high speeds.",0
"While the interior does have some nice touches, such as the chrome-rimmed, white-faced dials and body-colored accents, it is dominated by expanses of cheap plastic.",0
"Switchgear doesn't have quite the same brittle, low rent feel as most GM products, but it isn't in the same league as the Japanese competition, let alone VW.",0
"Overall, I can't recommend the PT Cruiser.",0
"Competitors such as the VW Golf and New Beetle, the upcoming MINI and Toyota's Matrix still seem to be a long way ahead of Chrysler in combining style AND a great driving experience.",0
PT Cruisers are cute looking little cars.,0
"Our experience with the car, and the large Phoenix area Chrysler dealership that we bought it from is that it is a horrible vehicle to own.",0
"In 40 years of car ownership, with at least 12 new cars and numerous used cars purchased, this was our first genuine""lemon.""",0
"Aside from being a gas hog, and not comfortable enough for anything other than short trips around town, the car has proven to be unreliable for use as basic transportation.",1
"Shortly after the installation of a 4th battery in 25 months in our 2002, ( 13,300 total miles driven ) PT Cruiser, ( Normal, according to the dealer's service department! ) we elected to trade that pile of junk in for a Honda.",0
"In two years of ownership, the PT Cruiser had warranty or recall work on the electrical system, suspension system, windows, tires, and fuel system.",0
My wife had a high-speed unexplained blow-out/tread failure in heavy urban traffic that nearly resulted in an accident.,0
"Granted, this may ( or may not ) have been the PT's fault, BUT when she called for the""roadside service,"" a feature touted as part of the 3 year bumper-to-bumper warranty, ( towing, tire changes, lock-outs, gas, etc. ) the Chrysler warranty folks refused to honor the request to come to her aid to change the blown out tire.",1
"They told us that according to THEIR records,"" we weren't the actual owners of the car!""",0
The VIN was ( in their records ) registered to someone we never heard of.,1
"This was a shock, since we ordered it and waited exactly one year for delivery...then paid cash ( the full sticker price ) at the dealer's only eighteen months ( and 8,000 miles ) prior to the mishap.",0
"Three different times, the wife had to call me to"" jump start"" the car and drive it to the dealer because of sudden, totally failed batteries.",0
"Upon installation of the car's 4th battery, the dealership STILL maintained there was nothing""wrong"" with the electrical system.",0
"At 6000 miles, the OEM tires mysteriously"" slipped"" on the chrome wheels, creating a bad out of balance situation.",0
"( Again...""normal,"" according to the dealership. )",0
"After a year, the left rear brake drum began to rust ( light rust is normal on a brake drum exterior ), but in this case, the rust was so severe that the drum began to slough off layers and slivers of iron, and bleed oxidation out onto the chrome wheel.",0
"When I asked the dealer's service department to evaluate it, ( while they changed out another dead battery ) our"" service manager"" glanced at it and said:"" Normal!",0
"They all do that!""",0
"Since"" they all do that,"" I asked him to show me another car on his huge lot that had a brake drum that was defoliating layers of iron anywhere nearly like ours.",0
"He got defensive and walked away, snapping that they would"" check it out.""",0
"They dismissed the situation as""normal"" again.",0
"There was a strong, sour ( as in sour milk ) odor each time the air conditioning was turned on after the car sat for a few hours in hot weather.",0
It usually took about 10 minutes to abate.,0
"In total, the PT Cruiser was easily THE SINGLE WORST new car I have ever had the misfortune to own.",0
"Unfortunately, a poor service department at our dealership, Earnhardt's Chrysler/Jeep made the experience even worse.",0
We're very happy to be rid of it.,0
"Now, to bring up a few important points about large SUVs to consider before purchasing.",0
"As you know, large SUVs have been stirring up a lot of controversy lately that buyers should know about before purchasing.",0
"I recently purchased a new car, but considered an SUV first and did a lot of research into them and promptly changed my mind.",0
"First of all, there are lots off hidden costs on large SUVs, like the Navigator.",0
"Of course, unless you have $ 40,000+ to spend on one, you are going to have a high car payment.",0
"Which is obvious, most consumers expect this.",0
But did you budget the high fuel cost as well?,0
"A Lincoln Navigator weights between 5,424 to 5,774 pounds.",0
"Because of this, it has a V8 engine.",0
Which means it gets 12.5 miles per gallon or less average.,0
Meaning that a Navigator driver is paying on average 3 to 4 times more for gas that a car driver.,0
This will add somewhere between $ 100 to $ 250 a month to your car payment.,0
"Okay, gas is cheap now..but for how long?",0
"When it goes back up, typically the resale value on the Navigator and other large SUVs goes down considerably, no one wants something that is going to use that much gas when the cost is unsteady.",1
Thats a lot of money to lose.,0
Then theres insurance.,0
"Because the Navigator is big and heavy, if the driver gets into an accident, it will cause a lot of property damage and injuries that your insurance company will have to pay for.",0
"On top of that, there is a big risk that the drivers or drivers family of the smaller cars will sue you.",0
Which means you and/or your insurance company could be out a lot of money.,0
They plan for this by charging a lot higher premium on SUVs than normal size cars.,0
This can vary with no-fault states.,0
You should get a quote from your insurance company first.,0
"Now, on average, the Navigator puts out over 3 times the carbon dioxide of a normal sized car.",0
This really angers people who care about the environment and causes them to do things to protest against this.,0
One of the popular things is SUV tagging.,0
Where theyll put bumper stickers on your SUV say things like your changing the climate and you dont care about the air.,1
Please check out the sites I have listed below for more information on this.,0

This is a new trend and who knows where it will go.,0
But do you want to constantly worry about your expensive Navigator being vandalized and then pay for the repairs?,0
Thats just more costs to worry about.,0
Like keeping your vehicle in your garage?,0
"Not the Navigator and most large SUVs, they wont fit unless you have a custom oversized garageanother expense.",1
"But, if you leave is outside, it s always dirty and that s a lot of SUV to wash or have washed.",0
One more popular misconception about large SUVs is that they are safer for families.,0
"For the most part, they are not.",1
"Especially the Navigator, it s based of the Ford F-150 chassis which has terrible ratings because it is still a truck body with out properly designed crumple zones or a firewall keeping the engine out of your lap.",0
Please check http://www.iihs.org,0
first!,0
The new VW Beetle gets better crash test ratings that most Ford/Lincoln SUVs and trucks.,0
Do your research first on any SUV.,0
"I recommend outlining why you need an SUV, maybe a minivan would be better because you can save $ 10,000 to $ 15,000, have a safer, more versatile vehicle and get better gas mileage.",0
Or maybe something that large is not needed at all.,1
Why would anyone want to buy this car?,0
The extra $ 6-7K buys you a car that has worse handling characteristics than an Accord.,0
"And except for memory /heated seats, xenon headlamps and 4 pieces of plastic""wood"" everything else is offered in the less expensive Accord.",0
"Well, everything but the engine....",0
This is an ultra responsive engine.,0
"In enhancing this engine, Acura liberally borrowed a host of technologies from the NSX and Honda Racing design pool.",0
And it shows... the acceleration is strong and linear.,0
It will beat out an Audi S4 Tiptronic or at the least hang with it.,0
"However once it has provided the""orgasmic"" acceleration and reaches cruising it shifts into 5th and is very hesitant to move out.",0
Its performance becomes more like a lofty cruiser.,0
"No problem here, thank god for the sportshift mode that allows you to do your own thing!",0
"Now, although the engine is truly superb the body is terrible.",0
What a shame!,0
The 260 HP powerhouse is not suited for this chassis and is a big mismatch.,1
Driving it in its present form makes the chassis beg for mercy.,0
I would rather drive the 200 HP Accord V6 than this.,0
The immense amount of power mated with the front wheel drive creates lots of torque steer ( which Acura'claims' it has eliminated but that is just press hype ).,0
The tires/wheels are also poorly selected for this kind of power.,0
It makes the vehicle very difficult to steer on rough pavement and at higher speeds.,0
The VSA system does not work well as I tested this out several times at the racetrack and the car exhibited some about of skidding out.,1
"And the car that I was driving, with exactly 3700 miles, was rattling like an old clunker.",0
Many people will think that just because it has 260HP makes it a sports car.,0
Hell no!,0
The handling characteristics of a car are of prime importance and this car will NOT qualify for the sports car/sedan moniker.,0
Sorry!,0
The build quality is very substandard with large gaps all over the body...especially near the doors.,0
"I do not know if this is by design but whatever, it looks terrible!",0
Ergonomics are average but not excellent.,1
I was not able to fit two drinks in there...the handrest and the shifter gets in the way.,1
Poorly designed.,0
"Also, the sunroof switches are hidden on the dash instead of by the sunroof!",0
At another time when I wanted to get a plant into the trunk I could not because the rear seatback is bolted on and does not fold down.,1
"Also, although it is longer than an Accord, interior room is less because of some wierd design cues.",0
This car has no redeeming qualities at all and is a complete waste of money.,1
I would just buy the Accord V6 and save the extra bucks.,0
If you want a real fun to drive sports sedan spend the extra $ $ $ and buy a BMW 3 series.,0
You can get a fully loaded pre-owned 3 series with very low miles for within this price range.,0
The 3 series is expensive for a reason.,0
"All good things cost money: ) It has the best safety in its class, handles like its on rails and has drop dead gorgeous styling.",0
"An alternative, although expensive, is the Audi S4.",0
Go test drive the S4 and you would not want to touch this TL with a 10 foot barge pole!,1
The S4 is truly exhillarating but it is currently selling above sticker ( obviously! ),0
The bottom line (update ):,0
"If Acura were to offer a higher priced pure performance-oriented version of this model for driving enthusiasts - with AWD, 245/45R18 tires, more comfortable seats to compensate for the stiff suspension, improved braking, real wood trim, 6-speed manual, reduce length to 186-188"" while maintaining interior room and improve the sedate styling, this would attract a lot of attention and seriously compete with bonafide sports cars like the Audi S4.",0
"After reading the positive reviews posted on epinion, I thought I would share my negative experience with consumers.",0
"It seems the Ford focus is a hit or miss model; the cars built right run fine, but those that miss the mark are unreliable and a hazard on the road.",0
We bought a new Ford Focus three months ago ( June 2002 )in Las Vegas.,0
"The research ( albeit a limited internet search ) told of a car which was inexpensive, safe, well built and sporty.",0
"One week after we bought the focus, the car died on a busy freeway.",0
It was repaired and returned in two days.,0
"Trusting the reliability of a new car, we drove from Nevada to Tucson, where it died again on a stretch of road called properly termed"" Dead Man's Highway"" in the middle of summer.",0
"Anyway, this type of incident occurred twice more since we've owned the focus.",0
And considering the car has been in the shop for almost half that time doesn't bode well for Ford reliabilty.,0
"Fuel pump problems seem to be our burden, but other focus owners have different, but equally disappointing problems with their vehicles.",0
Something common to all focuses though are brake problems.,0
"Car rental companies with focuses on their lot are told to replace brake pads at 15,000-20,000 miles because pads fail like clockwork.",0
"Car owners, unfortunately, are only given a warranty on brakes for 3 years or 12,000 miles, so replacement pads are an out-of-pocket expense.",0
A repeated problem continually found on focus complaint records are brakes that squeal and grind.,0
"The problem cannot be fixed, and Ford denies there are any design flaws.",1
"A website dedicated to filing a class-action lawsuit against Ford, www.fordfocusbreakproblems.com, might be of further help.",0
"Also, read the negative reviews found on carsmart.com.",0
"I believe my idea of a""hit or miss"" car will be clear from the reviews posted on that site.",0
"For those who love your focus, I am jealous.",0
I wish I could spend my weekends some place other then Ford service centers.,0
"For those who are looking to buy, do the research.",0
Please heed my warning and don't risk your time and money into a Ford focus.,1
I was on vacation in Florida in 2003 and during that time I had the opportunity to rent the 2002 Ford Mustang Convertible.,0
"I drove it for more than a week, so I think that I was able to see the good and the bad sides of driving this particular car.",0
Engine and transmission.,0
The Mustang that I drove had 3.8 liter V-6 in it mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission.,0
"The engine was adequately powerful and did nt need to downshift a single time, no matter what the road was.",1
"It was a silky smooth engine too, with deep, low, satisfying engine note; as a matter of fact I mistaken it for V-8 at first, but then out of curiosity I opened the hood, and saw that it was a V-6.",0
The engine sounded just like V-8.,0
"The transmission that the engine is mated to is very smooth also, with barely noticeable shifts.",0
Even the kickdown was smooth.,0
And that s where good stuff ends.,0
Handling,0
The car handled like a van.,0
Slightest turn and the car was rocking and rolling all over the place.,0
"While the car has very good ride in the straight line, doing a very good job isolating driver from the road bumps, if you need to make a turn ( and I am talking about just a slight turn, not something extreme ), you better have your seatbelt fastened, or you have a good chance of landing somewhere outside of the car.",1
"Granted it is a convertible, so it is not as stiff as a coupe, but still, it is considered a sports car afterall, so it should at least drive like one.",1
Design and Ergonomics,0
The car looks good from the outside.,0
"It has nice curves but without boy racer look, so it appeals to both older and younger drivers.",1
The visibility from the drivers seat is very good.,0
The front seats are cramped for such a large car.,0
"It is as long as many sedans, and wider than most of them, but it is pretty cramped in the front, and I am not even mentioning the backseat which is suitable mostly for children.",1
"I am 6 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds, which is pretty average.",0
Whoever was in charge of ergonomics should ve been fired or limited to designing floormats for Yugos.,0
"The door release lever is below drivers knee, in the most awkward spot, right where you would never expect to find it.",1
It took me a while to find it the first time when I was trying to get out of the car at night.,0
"None of the window switches are lit at night, same goes to power locks.",1
"There is no trunk release lever inside the car, so you need to get out of the car, and either use the key or button on remote control.",1
"On the fifth day of driving the car, I finally found the controls for moving the driver seat, they were located in the front of the seat ( power seat in this case ), and not on the left or right edge of the front side of the seat, but right behind drivers legs.",1
"When you try to open or close the top, you have to use the two levers, one on each side of the windshield, which might be troublesome for a single person.",0
"In Ford Thunderbird, they finally replaced them with single central lever, which is foolproof and easy to use.",0
The heating/cooling controls were designed in the dumbest way possible.,0
"For example: if you use air conditioning, you can not direct the airflow to the desired spot, because there is no separate button for A/C.",1
"Rather there is separate position for A/C on the same knob that is used to direct the airflow, so if the knob is in A/C position, it cannot be in defog position.",1
"I could not use the A/C for longer than 40 minutes, since I was wearing flip flops ( Florida ) and was risking of freezing my toes off.",1
"To be fair, Ford took care of most of these stupidities in their Ford Thunderbird convertible, but it also costs twice as much as the Mustang I drove.",0
"In the end, I would not recommend this car to anybody, as after short period of time, the feeling of rip-off will set in, as you start thinking about how much money Ford saved by giving the Mustang interior design job to a group of 5 Detroit bums.",1
"Driving the Mustang with its hard seats, lack of lumbar support and a hard as a rock suspension is like riding a real mustang and you will get saddle sores.",0
I looked over the field before I bought the Mustang and it had the power edge.,0
All I was interested in at the time was power and edgy looks.,0
I also just had to have a convertible.,0
"However, all that changed when I realized that I spend very little time looking at the car and a lot of time being beaten to death by it on the road.",0
It feels like it will break apart over some of the bumps.,0
It is also very loud inside the car.,0
I can barely hear the stereo at cruise.,0
There is a lot of rear end whine.,0
It sounds like a big rig is passing me but there is no truck there.,1
It wasn't long before I was wishing I had bought the Celica.,0
I shouldn't have gone and looked at the Celica once I bought the Mustang because I could kick myself.,0
"The Celica is much more quality oriented, the ride is smoother and the image suggests that I am not a redneck idiot.",1
Mustang suggests a redneck with grease under the nails and an inferiority complex.,0
"In the couple of months I owned my 2002 Mustang GT, i was sadly disapointed.",0
"The power was lacking in the 2V 4.6, I was getting beaten by Subaru WRX's.",0
The car would not break out of the mid 14s.,1
The one good thing I liked about it was the Mach 1000 sound system.,0
The car had fords ussual quality( crap ).,0
"When I purchased the car it had Blowmaster exhaust, which while it sounded great, it produced no extra power.",1
"Another thing I did not like was the fake hood and side scoops, domestic rice imo.",1
Perhaps it they were functional I would like them.,1
"Over all, I was disapointed.",0
"I sold the car after 5months and bought a brand new SOM Ws6 Trans Am, now that car has style and speed, I love the Ls1 motor and T56 trann",0
UPDATE: I am writing this update after owning my 2001 Ford Focus wagon only 4 1/2 months.,0
After taking my vehicle to the auto dealership to have them investigate why when the windows go down (especially the rear ones ) an extremely loud and painful vibration occurs.,0
When the service tech was in the car for a drive to understand the problems noted to him my husband rolled down the windows.,0
The tech described the sound and discomfort to when his ear drum broke a few months back.,0
As you can see the noise is painful!!,0
The tech then called the engineering department at Ford to find out how to deal with the problem.,0
The engineer had no idea as to how to fix the problem and said he had a stack of similar complaints on his desk.,1
Ford is selling Focus wagons knowing there is a window problem.,0
I am now in the process of finding out how to handle this problem.,0
How discouraging to buy a brand new car and be making payments and can't even roll down my windows!! Beware when checking into purchasing this vehicle.,1
"We are spending too much on gas for that van, I told my husband.",0
With that comment I went on my search for a new vehicle.,0
I knew I needed and wanted something big enough to still haul stuff like lumber or my kids bikes.,0
A regular car trunk just isn't deep enough for transporting lumber or long items.,1
"So, I knew if I wasn't getting another gas eating van it would have to be some sort of station wagon.",1
"Now, narrowed down to body type I went on my search of different makes and models of station wagons.",0
My first priority was price.,0
"Being a family of 5 money is tight and I needed something affordable, but of good quality.",0
I checked the prices of the VW Jetta wagon and the Saturn wagon.,0
Both were quite a bit more expensive!,0
The Ford Focus was by far the more affordable of the three.,0
Having access to a Ford A plan was another deciding factor.,0
Ford also at the time of my purchase was offering rebates and interests rates of 500.00,0
cash back 6.9 % interest or 1000.00 cash back and 7.99 % interest.,0
"We all know you get what you pay for, and maybe thinking it is cheaper because it is lacking in features.",0
This is far from the truth!,0
"The Focus Wagon has standard features such as; power door locks, power windows, CD player, air conditioning,and cruise control.",0
"Unfortunately, ABS breaks are not a standard feature and cost around 350-400 to have the option included.",1
The ease of getting in and out of the car was another factor in my purchase.,0
Unlike a lot of small cars the Focus Wagon seats sit higher.,0
I really like the crank under the seat to adjust the seating height.,0
I hate sitting in a car where my head almost touches the roof.,0
That is not a problem in the Focus Wagon.,1
The storage space in the back is extremely roomy and the pull over cover is an added plus.,0
I went shopping for 2 weeks of groceries for a family of 5 and had no problems getting all the bags in comfortably.,1
Space is definitely not a problem.,1
The gas mileage is the most important feature of this vehicle.,0
With today's gas prices going up this is a must feature to be looking at when choosing a new car!,0
"The engine in mine is a Zetec 4.25 L. It still has pep, but doesn't need a lot of gas to achieve the goal.",0
"My first fill up, after driving about 110 highway miles and then some city driving also, I figured the Focus Wagon got around 27 mile to the gallon!",0
"If you are looking for something affordable, roomy and has great gas mileage the Ford Focus Wagon is worth the money!",0
"Less than 40,000 on it.",0
"When purchased had only 5,500k.",0
This car was totally loaded.,0
"Got about 10,000 decent miles on it, before everything went wrong.",0
"Transmission slips, tie rods broke 3 times, sunroof twice,",0
"window problems, interior has some many squeaks, cracks pops and bird noises, i feel like i'm at the zoo.",0
"Look underneath, it's built like a matchbox car, those tiny suspension parts cannot hold up to everyday ( normal ) driving.",1
"Steer clear of any potholes, if you can.",0
Keep windows all the way up when it is raining ( even a light rain ).,0
"Water just comes in, goes all over the the power buttons, arm and your leg.",0
It simply amazes me that the Ford Taurus is still in production.,0
"After many years of major transmission, engine, and general quality control complaints one would have thought this car would have landed itself in an early grave.",0
"Unlike many other cars that had caused their owners so much anger and grief, do to poor reliability, quality control, and lack of dealer support, i.e the Hyundai Excel, the Ford Taurus somehow made it past all those thousands of unhappy customers and is still being sold for the 2002 year with the claim that it is""one of the best selling cars in America.""",0
"For the 2002 model year the Ford Taurus Sedan comes available in a multitude of trim lines that include the base LX, the SE, SES (tester ) and SEL.",0
The wagon is offered in SE and SEL trim. 2 powerplants are also available.,0
"All trims besides the SEL come standard with the reliable yet anemic OHV 3.0 Vulcan V6, while a DOHC Duratec 3.0 V6 is standard on the SEL and is an option on the lesser trim lines.",0
"Transmissions include a standard, clunky, unrefined, 4-speed automatic.",0
Driving Impressions:,0
My tester' Taurus SES Deluxe' had the optional 3.0 DOHC Duratec engine ( almost a $ 900 option ).,0
"At one point in time ( 1996 ) I was impressed with this engine, but alas other companies have moved ahead with technology and for 2002 this engine just seems like it's lagging in the refinement department.",0
"Off-the-line acceleration with the Duratec V6 is fair, but the DOHC Duratec seems lackadaisical compared to the 3.0 V6 in the 2002 Accord and totally anemic compared to the 3.5 V6 in the Nissan Altima.",0
"On take-off the Duratec almost strains to get this 3,500lb vehicle up to speed.",0
"Don't get me wrong, the car is not slow by any means, it just has to work much harder to get up to speed than the competition.",1
The 4-speed fully automatic transmission coupled to this engine only makes accelerating problems worse.,0
"The transmission, while loads refined over the AXOD tranny equipped in the 1986-1995 Tauruses still lacks the precise shifting associated with cars like the Camry or even the Chevy Impala.",1
"Clunky automatic shifting between 1st gear and 2nd is still noticeable, and shifting too soon ( high gear around 30 MPH)is still annoying, as the car has virtually no power at this speed in high gear, so automatic down-shifting and up-shifting while driving through town is almost inevitable if you don't manually take it out of overdrive.",0
"Handling in the 2002 Taurus is good, however like most family cars on the twistys, this car tends to lean which can be quite prevalent around bends at high speeds.",0
"The 2002 Taurus SES is not a bad handler for what it is, but like the powertrain, most of the competition has the edge in this department as well.",1
Cruising in this relatively large family sedan is not exactly another downfall for the Taurus SES but it's also not an attribute worth boasting about.,1
"When cruising at 60-65 MPH wind and engine noise can be heard in the cabin, but for the first time while in a Ford Taurus it did not bother me.",1
"With the older generation, wind and engine noise would get very annoying, and while it still can get annoying when accelerating under full throttle, the 2002 Tauruses are nowhere near as noisy, at least not with the Duratec engine.",1
"Since it's redesign in 2000, the Ford Taurus seems to take bumps much easier, and rattles are kept to a minimum; jolts are also much easier on the spine.",0
I can remember driving the 96-1999 Tauruses and not believing how many rattles and unexpected jolts would be present on bumpy surfaces.,1
There is a major improvement vs. the last generation in this dept.,0
Hills are taken well.,0
"Surprisingly the Duratec V6 enables this heavy weight to tackle up to 7 % grades without having to automatically down-shift to maintain 75 MPH, and can even gain speed up these sorts of inclines if given good'right foot power,' again without the need for the automatic to down-shift.",1
Braking in the 2002 Taurus SES deluxe is average-good.,0
"Despite this car having the infamous front disc, rear drum set-up, it has standard 4-wheel ABS which help assure good, safe stops.",0
"I was somewhat impressed with braking, however I still feel that with the price of the' Taurus SES deluxe' 4-wheel discs with ABS should be standard equipment.",0
Even with the tall gearing fuel economy is only average.,0
"The EPA is 20/27 which is lower than the larger, less sophisticated 3.8 OHV engined Chevrolet Impala.",0
Fuel Economy.,0
gov has more info on EPA ratings.,0
Interior Accommodation:,0
The interior of the 2002 Taurus SES is a mixed bag.,0
"While the car possesses many strong attributes, this car also has its obvious weak points.",0
"The interior vs its recent predecessor's is much more desirable, yet still remains cheap looking and the materials are still not up to par.",1
"For example, the dash seems dated, cluttered, and uninteresting.",0
"The instrument cluster is relatively small, but offers all the gauges you could want.",0
"Tachometer, temp gauge, etc. etc. are added for driver convenience and are very easy to read while driving.",0
"Some noteworthy'options' on the deluxe SES include, AC, 6 disc in-dash CD player, adjustable pedals; these adjustable pedals may sound cool in theory, but I feel Ford should have saved the money and used it on the poor quality leather seating, WWW.",0
CARS.COM has more info on all equipment that can be had with the SES deluxe trim.,0
Standard amenities include your basic family bag.,0
"Dual air bags, 4 cup holders, remote keyless entry, power everything, and cruise control.",0
"All amenities can boast that they are ergonomically friendly, however the stereo system is very cluttered, much like the systems in the Volvo line-up.",0
"This system also falls short in the clarity department, and received terrible FM reception while driving through local mountain valleys.",0
"Seating is average, yet again falls short of the competition.",0
My SES tester was equipped with optional front bucket'plastic feeling' leather seats with a'floor auto shifter' and console betwixt the driver and passenger.,0
"These seats offer good support and standard 6-way power adjustments, but due to the cheap feel they really put a hamper on certain aspects of my driving experience with this car.",0
Wearing a T-shirt and the outside temp being 55 degrees (yes that's all it gets here during the day ) my arms felt like they were resting on ice cubes while first trying to get comfy in these pleather seats.,0
The quality of the leather actually reminded me of the poor leather seating in my 1989 Mercury Sable.,0
"The rear seats are made of the same cheap material, which offers a 60/40 split configuration.",0
"Like all Ford Tauruses room remains very good, front and rear passengers will enjoy more than enough room for long trips.",0
Storage is also good.,0
Tons of room for a family of 5s' weeks worth of groceries.,0
There are also many storage compartments throughout the cabin.,0
Exterior Innovation:,0
"The exterior of the 2002 Ford Taurus, while once looking like what many thought looked like a jelly bean back in'86, than a space ship in'96, has now joined the world of Plain Jane automotive design.",0
"There are large see-through effect head lamps, and angled tail lamps, but this car still looks like every car you see on the Hertz rental car lot.",0
"The 16"" 5 spoke alloy rims, and optional spoiler do add some sport to this sedan, but still looks every bit the part of a car that was made to get lost in traffic.",0
The loss of the dual exhaust system on the Duratec equipped models just makes it that much harder for this car to look sporty.,0
"Price, Reliability, and Warranty:",0
"With the 2002 model year coming to a close I'm sure there are rebates out there on these cars, however my tester had none, and was priced at a whopping $ 23,000 without taxes.",1
Reliability with the Ford Taurus has almost always been poor.,0
"I always hear from Taurus owners that their new car has had no problems, but after 3 years they are in the shop getting a new transmission.",1
"This has been the norm for these cars for some years now, and I am now getting complaints that the'99 models are having reliability problems.",0
"Not sure if Ford fixed any of these problems, but if this car is a'must' on your shopping list, and you can afford it, I would ask for an extended warranty, as Ford only offers a 3 year 36,000 mile warranty with roadside assistance.",1
"To the casual observer, the Ford Focus would seem to be little more than a big company s entry into the small car segment.",0
And to a certain degree that is true.,0
Whats not readily obvious to most is that the Ford Focus has essentially redefined the compact car segment.,1
"Ford has done with the Focus something General Motors seems unwilling or unable to do with its small cars  build a reliable, fun, sporty, practical car offered in many different styles, all for a sticker price of under $ 20,000.",0
In many ways the Focus has no competent rival.,1
"The Cavalier is a relic, the Corolla is getting rather pricey and while no one would argue with its reliability, the Civic seems so generic when compared to the much cooler Focus.",0
"In order to find a suitable alternative to the Focus, one has to look ahead to the 2003 model year at the Pontiac Vibe, or perhaps the new for 2002 Civic Si.",0
"But remember, the Focus has been around for years.",0
"For 2002 the Ford Focus is available in no less than six configurations: 3-door hatchback, 4-door sedan, station wagon, a hot-rod SVT, and now a 5-door hatchback, or ZX5.",1
"Although the new ZX5 is the main topic here, much of what will be said is also applicable to other Focus styles as well.",0
"Originally the Focus  styling seemed odd, especially the hatchback versions.",0
And certainly odd would be an appropriate way to describe the ZX5.,0
"5-door cars have been a common sight on the roads of Europe for many years, but somehow our American tastes shied away from hatchbacks.",0
"Mazda made a 5-door version of its 626 in the early 90s, and the awful Sterling brand had an available 5-door model, but the Focus and the VW Golf seem to be the most visible signs that American buyers silent boycott of 5-door hatchbacks is over ( some may argue the Protg 5 and Lexus SportCross fit that category as well ).",0
"With its high roof line and tall stance, the ZX5 Focus seems to have almost a small van look to it from certain angles.",0
"The rear retains the 3-doors funky taillight treatment, and the front is all Focus with those big eye looking headlamps and uncluttered hood.",0
Standard equipment on the ZX5 Focus is impressive.,0
"Features such as a 6-disc, in-dash CD changer, alloy wheels, power windows, power mirrors and remote locking doors are quite a bargain at a price of $ 15,450.",0
"The ZX5 also comes standard with Fords 2.0 liter, 130 hp Zetec engine.",0
Inside the ZX5 there is more room than one might expect from a compact car.,0
"Head room is ample, as is hip and shoulder room.",0
"Nothing is more frustrating than driving or riding in a car that seems to have more head room than any other car on the market, but causes you to rub shoulders with the person in the next seat.",0
"The rear seat folds flat to increase storage, but the Focus Wagon has more useable cargo space behind the rear seat.",0
"With the rear seat flipped up to carry people, the rear cargo area becomes a bit on the smallish side  again, why not just get the wagon.",1
The only explanation for choosing the ZX5 over the wagon is style.,0
"If you need to carry five people and your under 30, go with the ZX5, if youre over 30 chances are you could care less what anyone thinks about station wagons  get the wagon, it holds more stuff.",0
The bold exterior styling carries over into the cabin of the ZX5.,0
"A large, round pod holds the stereo and various other controls, and the dash incorporates the exteriors creased edge  look.",0
"Seats are comfortable and adjust in many different ways, although those adjustments are manual in nature.",0
"Leather seating is available as an option, but the quality of that leather is lacking.",0
It feels more like fake leather or leatherette. ,0
"The driving position feels a little like that of a school bus at first - high, but it s not nearly as bus-like as the PT Cruiser.",1
"Materials have a quality feel throughout, and the cheap plastic-like stuff shows up only occasionally.",0
"On the road, the Focus is surprisingly agile.",0
This car is actually quite sporty.,0
"Handling is quick and precise, lacking the vague feel of other small domestic cars like the Pontiac Sunfire or Grand Am. Ride quality is excellent for a smaller car, and road noise is low as well.",0
"Its no Lexus at highway speeds, but the ZX5 has a smooth quietness that feels similar to the Subaru Impreza or the Honda Civic.",1
"The 5-speed manual shifts without drama, and the lever goes into each gear with just the right amount of smoothness and enough resistance to make a stick-shift fun.",0
"Although the little Zetec engine has plenty of low end power, it is also quite rev happy, but without the harsh sound of many other 4 cylinder engines.",0
"130 hp does nt sound like a lot of power, but the larger 4 cylinder Honda Accord has only 20 more hp, and the Toyota Corolla has 5 fewer horses than the Focus  2.0 liter engine.",0
"When ordered with the 5-speed, the Focus can seem quite powerful  second gear tire chirps are easy to come by.",0
"When shifting hard, there is noticeable torque-steer, but it does not feel dangerous as with other front wheel drive cars such as the SAAB 9-3.",1
"During normal driving, torque-steer is not noticeable at all.",1
"Overall, the Focus ZX5 is a very competent compact car.",0
"While most performance enthusiast eagerly await the pavement scorching SVT Focus, many want the practicality of a sedan, with the increased cargo room of a hatchback.",0
"The ZX5 is perhaps a compromise in many ways, and yet a stint behind the wheel makes one realize how little is actually sacrificed.",0
"The ZX5 offers nothing more or less than other Focus  offer; youthful styling, peppy performance, superb handling, room for 5 adults, lots of convenience features, and a price well below $ 20,000.",0
"Essentially the Focus ZX5 is roomier than it looks, and sportier than it has to be  The Who said it best, Id call that a bargain ",0
"When I took delivery of this car in June 2002, it was little known and often mistaken for a Honda Civic.",0
"One of the first ones on the street of Toronto, I immediately got compliments taking the members of a local car club free rides in some twisty industrial areas.",0
"At that time, it was essentially considered""one of a kind"".",0
"The price was near $ 30,000 ( obviously pricey in hindsight ), but it had the most bang for the buck.",0
I had considered two other vehicles.,0
The Subaru WRX and the Toyota Celica GTS.,0
"At 6'3"", the Subaru WRX did *not* fit my physical dimensions.",0
It had a too-low ceiling and not enough legroom.,1
"As for the Celica GTS, not only did I not fit in it, I considered it rather heavy for such limited power.",1
The power-to-weight-ratio was less than desirable.,0
"After already having leased a Focus ZX3, the anticipation was killing me as I awaited the announcement of the replacement for the SVT Contour.",0
"I had premonitions that Ford would produce the SVT Focus, and that was confirmed in February of 2001.",0
"When Ford finally took orders in July of 2001, I was the first one at my dealership - without a test drive.",1
"At 170 bhp, the new SVT Zetec engine was the most advanced four-cylinder engine ever produced.",0
Its variable intake manifold complimented well with the variable cam timing.,0
"With 145lb-ft of torque and 80 % of that @ 2500rpm, torque-steer was still non-existent.",0
The best feature in this car was its handling - it is NOT a 1/4mile car.,1
"Its revised suspension consisting of higher spring rates, larger stabilizers and 1/2"" lowered stance, made this car corner like it was on a slot-car track.",0
"I was quite aware of this when after just 4500 km of daily driving, I had finally performed the official""breaking-in"" at a local road track.",0
"Accompanied with higher-power Ford Mustangs both vintage and new, the SVT Focus ate them all for lunch through the corners.",0
I carried most of my speed through the corners without having to brake.,1
"Though once I reached the straightaways, I had to say goodbye to all the distanced gained from the corners, watching helplessly as supercharged Mustangs passed me by.",0
No worries.,1
"I fully enjoyed travelling to the twisting, crooked roads of Maine from Toronto, Ontario.",0
Frost heaves in that region didn't affect the handling of the car too much.,1
"The off-cambered, blind 90-degree turns were no problem for the SVT Focus.",1
"I, on the other hand felt the instant gratification the moment the car stuck through the apex and out the other side.",0
"As a daily driver, after having driven it for more than a year, and as the gas prices rose to gasping proportions in Canada, it gets pricey.",0
The reliability of the car is way above average ( compared to other Foci).,0
The cost of operation hits you in the maintenance.,0
"High-octane gas (91+ ) is the standard, though for spirited driving, I recommend Sunoco's 92 or 94.",0
The cost of an oil change dramatically increases as well from that of the ZX3.,0
"After the break-in period, only synthetic oils touched the inside of the engine.",0
AMSOIL or Mobil-1 comes to mind.,0
"Compared to other sport compacts of similar size, the SVT Focus has PUNCH.",0
It beat the Honda Civic Si and the VW GTI in Road and Track magazine as the best valued car given the performance characteristics.,0
"Sure, you could also probably modify other imports and *try*, just *try* to match its overall package, but if you don't feel like spending your time and extra money trying to decide what *might* work for you, save your money and buy something that's FUN and FAST right out of the box.",1
Just don't forget to break those tabs before operating.,0
"At the time of this writing, I have had my SVT Focus for about two weeks, and I...am...in love.",0
"Let's start with the visuals... Personally, I have a very slight issue with the way the window line travels up to the rear of the car on the sides, and then back down to a point on the gate.",0
"I don't think it looks bad, per se, but I can't tell you exactly what the issue I have actually is.",1
I can only say there's something about it.,0
"So, I ordered mine in black not only because I love black cars, but also to de-emphasize the rear window line.",1
I even blacked out the windows with dark tint.,0
"I think it looks completely sharp in black, and let me tell you -- if Darth Vader drove a car, this would be it.",0
"I love Ford's New Edge design concept, which traces it's roots back directly to the Ford GT-90 concept car of the early nineties ( who says concept cars serve no purpose in the production world? ), and I think they did a particularly bang-up job with the Focus 3-door ( much better than the new-style Cougar ).",1
The car looks like it's hauling a-- even when it's parked.,0
I often find myself standing and staring at it after parking just because it looks so darned cool.,0
"The agressive, angular front end mates well with the curved, swooping roofline that tapers off in the rear, and the custom fog lights, rear spoiler, and 17-inch argent five-star rims that SVT installed put the icing on the cake.",0
"Not that cheap sugar icing, either -- we're talking gourmet butter icing, baby!",1
"And, although it is defined as a"" small car,"" it really isn't that small.",1
"It's taller than most of the cars I park next to, and the wheelbase is",0
103 inches.,0
Let's talk about comfort now...,0
"The smell of the leather interior is absolutely dreamy, and it is outdone only by the way the SVT seat wraps around you and makes you feel completely comfy while driving.",0
"They fit [me ] so well, in fact, that when I'm driving, I actually cannot feel the seat.",1
Say what?,0
You read that right.,0
Let me explain...,0
"You know how, after you've been in a car for a while, you can tell what parts of the seat are pushing on you?",0
"Maybe your thighs are pressing against the side supports, or the lumbar support is jutting into your back a tad too much, or maybe even that darned seatbelt extension is about an inch too long, and it's poking your beer belly.",0
No problems for me in the SVT!,1
"Even after extended periods in the car, the seat feels completely natural.",0
"This is due, in part, to the nice adjustments Ford built into them.",0
"Not only can you adjust the lumbar support, back angle, and forward position, but you can also adjust the ride height of the seat.",1
"Very nice for adjusting the headroom and seeing over the steering wheel, should you need a""boost"".",0
"BTW, I'm 6'1"", 200 lbs., just so you can gauge.",0
Driving position is excellent and sporty.,0
The steering wheel and gear shifter are exactly where they should be in relation to the driver.,0
"All controls are within easy reach, and the leather-wrapped wheel and shift knob are a dream to grab.",0
The silver-faced guage cluster is awesome and easy to see.,0
"At night, the faces glow green and the numbers are black.",0
The red SVT graphic on the panel glows purple under the gauge lights -- pretty cool.,0
"I think the stereo controls could have been laid out a little more stylishly, but they aren't bad ( They're definitely better than the plastic toy Speak'n Spell-style buttons that GM loves to put in their vehicles! ).",0
The stereo display is large and very easy to read.,0
"Oh, by-the-way, it sounds great, too!",0
"The subwoofer is very powerful, especially for an eight-incher.",0
It is concealed in a nicely-finished ported box that sits on the driver-side wall in the cargo area.,0
"This takes up a little bit of your cargo room, of course, but hey -- did I buy an SVT to haul groceries and gear in huge quantities?",0
I can deal with it.,0
The six-disc in-dash CD changer is a luxury -- no annoying cartridge to deal with; you just load them all in the slot.,1
There is also a radio/stereo control stalk that comes off the steering column on the lower left side for easy finger-tip sound control while driving.,0
"In summation, when you close the door and seal yourself inside, the relationship of driver and car is T-I-G-H-T.",0
"Road noise is a bit of an issue, due in large part, in my opinion, to the low profile ContiSport tires and large 17"" rims.",0
"That's a lot more solid material to transfer sound, and you can tell.",0
"It's not bothersome to me, but if it irks someone like you, then the application of some aftermarket spray undercoating would take care of a lot of the noise.",1
"Yes, the ride is rough on less-than-desireable roads, but I wouldn't have it any other way.",0
You pay a price for a car that performs and handles as well as the SVT Focus.,0
"Handling is a dream, pure and simple.",0
"I didn't think it was possible, but the SVT handles as well and is as fun to drive as my hopped-up Alfa Romeo GTV6, and that is saying a lot!!!",1
"If you have ever driven an Alfa, you know what fun they are, and the SVT matches.",0
"The car goes exactly where you point it, and there is no perceivable torque steer, which is something that has always irked me about front-drivers.",1
How tight is it?,0
Last night I took a corner that was marked for 30 MPH at 65.,0
I don't recommend you try this at home.,0
"Coming into the unexpected turn, I thought I was going to dig a trench, but instead, the SVT dipped its nose, dug in, and sprung right back out again, taking the turn and teaching the road a lesson while it was at it.",0
Amazing.,0
It behaved like it had a tough racing torsion bar suspension.,0
"In, dip, and out.",0
"For a front-driver especially ( 61 %/39 % weight distribution ), the handling is amazingly neutral.",0
"There is no pronounced over- or understeer, unless you really want it to be there.",1
"Once again, the driver is in command.",0
The engine is amazing.,0
"Ford took the already-nice Zetec I-4 found in the ZX3 and cooked up a variable intake valve timing system, which ups the HP from 130 to 170, and gives you 145 lb/ft of torque to work with.",0
"Couple this power with the gorgeous Getrag six-speed gear box, and you have speed-on-demand through the entire range of the engine.",0
Seriously.,0
There are no dead spots in the power curve.,1
"From stop to redline, the motor will pull and go like a champ, with no perceivable lag anywhere, and it sounds great doing it.",1
"The gear ratios are right on target, too.",0
"Normally, with a modern manual transmission (esp.",0
"a six-speed ) I expect fifth or sixth gear to be sort of an""overdrive"" gear; not worth much for performance.",1
"However, sixth gear in the SVT is actually a useable gear.",0
All of them are very nicely and smoothly spaced.,0
"In addition to the VIVT system, Ford also stuck in some other improvements, including forged steel connecting rods, aluminum pistons, and a dual-stage intake system, which dramatically improves torque and low-end performance.",0
"The compression ratio is also higher, at 10.2:1, so you have to use premium fuel.",0
"There are also some pretty cool mods after the engine, including the dual-mass flywheel and one-in two-out shaft design of the gearbox.",0
"If you want to know how these work, you can find the info at http://www.svt.ford.com",0
"You have to be careful when shopping for an SVT Focus, because many dealers will charge an extra fee on top of the MSRP simply because it's an SVT, and therefore more collectible.",0
"However, if you shop around, you can find dealers that won't gouge you.",1
"I found mine at Covert Ford, in Austin, for sticker: $ 19,265.00,",0
which is exactly what Ford says they should charge.,0
"Northside Ford, in San Antonio, wanted 23K for the same car.",0
"In case you didn't know, not all Ford dealers sell SVT cars.",1
"Only specially-authorized dealers get them, and they are only allotted a certain number per year.",0
"If you find one for MSRP, don't expect to talk them down on the price, either.",1
SVTs are also usually exempt from any special deals or rebates.,0
"Having the SVT badge on your car guarantees a certain level of collectibility, and the dealers know it.",0
Being an SVT owner has other perks as well.,0
"You get a free one-year membership to the SVT Owners Assoc., and a free loaner car when yours is in for servicing.",0
Nice touch.,0
"If you're into it, there are also TONS of aftermarket performance parts available for the Focus.",0
Not that it needs it...,1
Ford Focus Hatchback 2002.,0
Focus for the New Century.,0
"At first glance looking at the front end of the Ford Focus Hatchback looks like a regular Ford vehicle but as you proceed to look at the rest of the Focus, you will notice it has a very particular look.",0
The Focus Hatchback looks as if Ford designers started putting this car together by throwing away all the basic rules about designing a car.,0
It is well equipped and for those who wants to load it up Ford will offer you an excellent selection of options for your driving pleasure.,0
The interior of the focus is very spacious and this is due to the raised roofline at the front.,0
Also you should appreciate the extra wide doors which can make entering and exiting much easier.,0
All the controls are well placed and can easily be seen and reached by the driver.,0
Also I noticed that the controls most often used are placed in a manner that they are much easier to locate than the ones not used regularly.,1
The exterior look of this car is certainly where it stand out from other compact cars.,0
Not only because the new bold design but it gives the impression of a tightly put together exterior panels.,1
It may take some time for consumers to get used to this design but lets face it I have seen other unusual designs that became hits with the public.,0
I guess only time will tell about the acceptance of this new style.,0
I had the opportunity to rent the Focus during a recent visit to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington DC.,0
"When I made my reservation, I asked the car rental company if they had any available and they did.",0
"The first thing I noticed was how well the interior and exterior colors really complimented each other's, the car really looked good.",0
During the weekend I mostly did city driving and it almost made driving around in a strange city a pleasure.,0
I did drive for short while on the highway and again it felt that even if this is a compact car it still has enough power to feel safe for highway driving.,0
Breaking with this automobile was smooth and the vehicle came to a quick stop every time.,0
The Ford Focus I rented was equipped as follows.,0
"The Engine was a 4 Cylinder, 2.0 Liters DOHC Zetec engine with 130 Horsepower.",0
IT had a 4-Speed automatic transmission.,0
The brakes were disc for the front and drum in the rear.,0
As for the fuel economy it gets 25 MPH in the city and 33 on the highway.,0
"The curb weight of the Focus hatchback is 2,551 Lbs.",0
The sitting capacity is 5 persons.,0
The Ford Focus hatchback is an interesting and pleasant car to drive.,0
"I had the opportunity to drive it for two full days and even if it is considered a compact, I did not feel cooped in and uncomfortable at all in the Focus.",1
I would certainly consider going on a long drive with it and I believe it to be an ideal car for a young family.,0
"Almost 40 years old now, the Mustang is still going strong.",0
"According to specs sells have reached over 150,000 units for 2002 alone; people continue to flood into showrooms to get the'best bang for their buck'.",0
"The Mustang for 2002 comes in 4 models, the 2 base trim lines which feature a 190 horsepower 3.8 liter engine that is offered in either a convertible or coupe.",0
"The other 2 trim lines are performance models, known as the GT.",0
"The GT features a SOHC, 4.6 liter unit, and is also offered in either a coupe or convertible.",0
"NOTE: There is no Cobra offered this year, next year there will be a 390 horsepower, supercharged, Cobra Mustang.",1
Driving Impressions:,0
"Since 1999 the Mustang GT has underwent dramatic styling, performance changes, and minor interior and chassis modifications.",0
Most people favor these changes made by Ford.,0
"The Mustang GT no longer has a'just adequate' 215 horse power as it did in 1996-1997, nor does it have 225 horse power like it had in'98.",1
"For the 2002 model year the Mustang GT now has an exciting 260 horsepower at 5,250 RPM, and 302 lb-ft of torque with its modified 4.6 liter SOHC modular V8. 260 horse power for a Muscle car/sports car may not sound'super powerful', especially since its rival, the Camaro Z28 has 60 more horses.",1
The 2002 GT does very well with the the 260 horses provided.,0
"The 5-speed allows the driver to get the most out of this engine, although it would be appreciated if a silky smooth 6-speed was added to the line-up.",0
The considerable power increase in the mid-range after 1999 means the GT really moves!,0
"Burnouts are almost inevitable when matched with the 5-speed manual, especially when in the hands of a driver with a heavy foot.",0
"The GT is very strong off the line, and continues to be so all the way to 100 MPH.",0
"The top speed is reported to be near 150 MPH, but you won't see me driving one that fast, at least not on the street.",1
"I have only taken my friends 2002 Mustang GT Coupe ( my test machine ) out for a few runs by myself, and each time it's a blast.",0
"I do test drive quite a few cars, and out of all the cars under $ 30,000, the 2002 GT is one of the most involving to drive, and one of the fastest to boot.",0
"On the freeway the Mustang is a little louder than needed, but this is all part of the fun.",0
"The GT's dual exhaust offers a beefy note, letting other drivers know you are in a serious muscle car.",0
"The Mustang GT is very compliant on bumpy roads, especially for a performance natured car, and does quite well in slippery conditions, thanks to its genius traction control.",0
A stiff chassis and well-tuned suspension means the 2002 Mustang GT really takes to twisty roads with enthusiasm.,0
"A fairly wide-track, and large 17"" rims, with all season radials result in excellent stability and impressively high levels of grip.",0
Braking is also good.,0
"My Test car came with 4-wheel discs with 4-wheel ABS, this is standard safety equipment on all 2002 Mustangs.",0
Note: Expect to get around 26 MPG with conservative driving with the 5-speed manual.,0
Also a 4-speed automatic transmission is optional.,0
"About the engine: In 1996, the Mustang GT ditched the 5.0 OHV unit, and got a new engine in the form of a 4.6 liter V8 modular unit.",0
"While rated at only 215 horse power in 1996 and 1997, and 225 in 1998, the 1999-2002 Mustang GT's offer basically the same 4.6 SOHC engine, only with 260 horse power and 302 lb-ft of torque.",0
"This welcomed increase in power is mainly because of higher lift, longer duration cams, bigger valves, and a revised intake system.",0
"The 2002 Mustang GT also got a revised suspension in 1999, namely a wider rear track, and greater suspension travel.",0
The 1999-2002 Mustang GT's also have received revised shock absorbers and anti roll bars to improve handling.,0
note: The base models equipped with the 3.8 liter engines do not get this treatment.,1
Interior Accommodation:,0
"The interior of the 2002 Mustang GT is very well laid out, and very well equipped.",0
"Test car came with power everything, a thick leather wrapped steering wheel, an optional 460 watt stereo system, with a 6 disc CD changer.",0
"( a 1,140 watt System is available if you want to blow your ear drums out.)",0
"Some other amenities included a super cold AC, daytime running lamps, a tachometer, a theft deterrent system, and tinted glass.",0
"Ergonomics are near perfect in the 2002 GT, and so is the drivers position.",0
"The GT offers excellent visibility, easy-to-use controls, and superior comfort for long journeys.",0
The Mustang GT's 2 front sport bucket seats were dressed in leather and boasted 6 way power.,0
"The seats in the Front are very comfortable and supportive, but because of the lack of leg and head room in the rear, the experience is not quite as positive.",1
The front passenger and driver are given plenty of room however.,0
Exterior Innovation:,0
"Since the Mustangs Substantial makeover for 1999, this car looks aggressive and distinctive with a wider, more road hugging stance.",0
"There really is not much difference from the look of the base models, expect some minor cosmetic treatments, some include side hood scoops, and a GT badge on the side of the car, and a' Mustang GT' badge in-graved in the rear bumper.",1
"The front Headlights are flush, and very slightly'cat eyed', triple taillights continue to be part of the Mustangs theme, but they now have sharper edges like the rest of the body.",0
"Price, Warranty, and Reliability: The 2002 Mustang starts out at around $ 16K for the base modeled coupes.",0
"A GT model will run in-between $ 22,000-$ 28,000.",0
"My test car has 8,000 miles on it, and my friend has never had to take it to the shop, but with only 8,000 miles it's kinda hard to comment on her car's reliability.",1
"The GT has always been a fairly reliable car, even in its pushrod days, the GT has offered years of reliable performance, just look at all the older GT's we see on the road.",0
"I suggest you ask around, I'm guessing you will hear good news from the owners of these cars.",0
"Ford does not offer the best warranty, Ford offers a 3 year 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty on the GT.",1
Final Notes:,0
"It takes a certain type of person to appreciate the Mustang GT, if you are into high revving 4-cylinders this is definitely not your car.",1
The 2002 GT offers excellent muscle and accommodation at an excellent price.,0
"If you liked this review, you might also like to read my review on the Mustang's rival, the Camaro Z28",0
-Happy Car Shopping!,0
"I feel, that since I have had my Mustang seventeen months and have put on just shy of 26,000 miles, I can make a fair assessment of this vehicle.",0
I have a laser red 5-speed GT convertible with the premium package and a beige leather interior and beige top.,0
"I will review the following aspects of the vehicle: interior and exterior styling, performance, handling and driver and passenger comfort.",0
"Along the way, I will touch on the aspects of the vehicle that I don't like and those that I really enjoy.",0
Exterior Styling,0
I really like the way the car looks.,0
"After parking it and walking away, I often have the urge to look over my shoulder to take another look at the vehicle.",0
The sharp lines and coordinating ( in my opinion ) bright red and beige top really stand out.,0
"While the fake hood and side scoops draw a lot of flack, they do add a certain amount of flair to the car, allowing it to stand out and look a little more muscular.",0
The 17-inch Bullitt wheels with the three stripe Mustang logo in the center are classic and add a nice throwback to the styling of the 70's.,0
"One small weakness is the that wheel wells seem too large for the 17"" wheels and give, what has been described by a friend as, a 4x4 look to the car.",0
I couldn't agree more.,0
"18"" wheels really fill the wells and make the car look even better.",0
"The lines of the car provide the driver with a high hood and shoulder line but this is acceptable to make one feel more like they're sitting in the car, despite the flat bucket seats ( more on that later ).",0
"The dual, stainless exhaust tips accent the rear of the vehicle, my favorite aspect of the styling is the front fascia, headlights and grille with the chrome mustang.",0
"A good compromise was made, I feel, between aggressive and sleek design options.",0
"The wrap-around headlights and indicators provide a sleek, aerodynamic appeal while the fairly sharp-cornered bumper and raked grille add a slight harshness to the smoothness of the other details.",0
Overall the car looks great.,0
"The only downfall I can see with the exterior design is the possibility that it may look a little dated in a few years, much like the mid to late 90's Mustangs do.",0
"On a slightly similar note, one problem with the exterior of my vehicle is that the driver and passenger doors don't seem to line up flush with the rear quarter panels.",1
"While this doesn't detract from the overall styling, it's annoying none-the-less.",1
I'm really excited about the'05 Mustang styling and it may force me to buy another one a few years down the road.,0
Interior Styling,0
This really is a love-hate relationship.,0
"The beige dash, carpet and leather go really well with the red exterior and beige top.",0
I have had a number of people comment on how nice the interior of the car looks upon entering the vehicle.,0
"And, for the most part I agree.",0
The light beige with dark brown accents provides a comfortable atmosphere in which to drive.,0
"The symmetric gauge cluster is simple, clean and easy to read and at night, it lights up with pleasing green and red hues.",0
"The center console, where the HVAC., radio and miscellaneous buttons for fog lights, traction control and rear defrost are located, also light up in the same green glow.",0
The three HVAC.,0
knobs are simple looking but effective.,0
The wrap-around dash and door panels provide a decent cockpit-like feel to finish off the styling.,0
"Another nice touch is the proliferation of the galloping mustang: on the steering wheel, stitched into the driver and passenger seats, in the floor mats and on the windshield.",0
A nice touch to impress upon the passengers that this is in fact a true American icon.,0
"The problem is, like the exterior styling, I fear the interior will also feel dated in a couple of years.",0
"The""dual arch"" dash with sloping center console that transitions to the shifter bezel and armrest seems cliched.",0
"Also, while some of the materials feel good to the touch and provide a soft, almost spongy feel, others, like the door handle inserts, shifter bezel, A-pillar covers and center console panels feel like, and really are, cheap plastic.",0
The cruise control buttons also seem like an item that has been thrifted.,0
"A few months ago, the retainer tab that keeps the on and off button in place broke, causing the button to fall off.",0
Fit and finish is also a bit below par.,0
"The A-pillar covers don't line up well with the dash, the center console panel doesn't sit flush with the shifter bezel and the door handle inserts bow out and leave a gap between the main door panel and the insert.",0
"The last problem, with the door panel inserts, causes an annoying buzzing issue when the radio is turned up or there is a large bass hit from the speakers in the doors.",0
"And lastly, the seats for this version of the Mustang could use some attention.",0
"They provide very little lateral support such that when cornering, one is inclined to slide around a fair amount.",0
"Further, they don't look like true pony or sports car buckets but instead they are flat and unappealing.",0
"The leather seems a bit hard and the""back seat"" ( in quotes because its best use is as a package shelf ) is done in vinyl and not leather.",1
The head rests on the front two seats are small and because of the seat back design appear almost worthless in preventing any sort of whiplash.,0
"I don't understand the oversight here because the other versions of the Mustang: Bullitt, Mach 1 and Cobra have better leather and head rests.",1
I'm almost inclined to say that my friend's cloth GT seats are better than mine.,0
"Even though I like leather better than cloth, it makes it hard to overlook these shortfalls.",0
"Another such short fall was at about 10,000 miles some cracking in the driver's side seat back requiring a replacement of the seat cover started to appear.",0
"Additionally, I would very much like to replace my head rests with matching Bullitt or Mach 1 restraints but I'm not sure the same color is available.",1
Performance,0
Performance: one of the main reasons for the purchase of this car.,0
Does it get any better than a V8 linked to a 5 speed manual transmission?,0
"While this is highly debatable, it probably doesn't get much better than the Mustang considering the cost of the vehicle and what it was designed to do.",1
"My GT is outfitted with Ford's 4.6L 2V SOHC V8 from their modular line of eight cylinder engines and the Tremec T3650 5-speed manual transmission ( as I understand it, an original Getrag design, though I may be mistaken ).",0
Horsepower is rated at 260 hp at 5250 RPM and there is 302 lb-ft of twist available at 4000 RPM.,0
"While the car pulls pretty well below 2500 RPMs, the real acceleration and power is definitely felt in the 3000-5000 RPM range.",0
The exhaust note adds the exclamation point to the power and acceleration making the car feel a bit faster than it probably is.,0
"However, it is very easy to chirp the tires in first, second and third gears when accelerating hard.",0
The car possesses a willingness to go from a standstill and has no problems accelerating onto an interstate or overtaking a semi at highway cruising speeds.,1
"There's an addictive quality to downshifting from fifth gear into forth or even third at these higher speeds, and watching the revs ramp up eagerly while the engine responds appropriately.",0
The car feels just as capable cruising along at 70 to 85 mph as it does between 35 and 45 mph.,0
"Surprisingly to me, it seems that the engine would not be out of its element to cruise along at 85 mph all day long, much like the machinery under the hood of a BMW.",1
"This aspect of the engine, while pleasing, was quite surprising and unexpected.",0
I hope the durability and dependability will live up to this notion.,0
Another surprising and pleasing aspect to the performance of the engine was the fuel economy.,0
"Most of my driving is conservative: shifting between 2000 and 2500 RPM, with the occasional high-speed shift.",0
"With this driving, I have been able to obtain an overall fuel economy of just over 22 MPG using standard 87 octane unleaded.",0
"On longer road trips, with expressway driving, I have been able to squeeze out 27.7 MPG!",0
"This provides a range of about 400 miles; for a V8, I was impressed.",0
The transmission does an adequate job sending the torque to the rear wheels.,0
First gear seems short and fifth seems quite tall.,0
"Overall, the ratios seem appropriate and the transmission doesn't seem over tasked with the power and torque being sent through it.",1
It is not perfect though.,1
"The throws, especially from forth to fifth, are quite long.",0
"It feels good for going from first to second or from third to forth, but I feel a bit over extended in the last up shift.",0
The shifter also seems a bit notchy.,0
I understand that these two issues can be solved with a Steeda or similar aftermarket brand shifter but I wonder if the notchyness and sometimes the difficulty of getting into a gear is the fault of the shifter or some other problem.,0
Perhaps I worry too much but I'm concerned about the longevity of the synchros.,0
On cold days ( less than 20F ) I've also experienced a strange whistling/whining noise at about 2000 RPM that I believe to be gear whine from the transmission.,0
I haven't heard it since the weather has started warming up but this is still a concern that I may have investigated.,0
"And lastly, there's a fair amount of driveline lash that causes a clunk in some accelerating situations from low RPMs.",0
"Overall, the performance of the Mustang GT can be defined as a smile inducing, great value.",0
Handling/Steering,0
"Some of the best handling cars that I've driven include a 1997 BMW M3, a 1991 Jetta GLI with aftermarket Pirelli tires, a 2003 Mazda 6 and surprisingly a 2002 Focus ( all models, including the wagon and SVT handle quite well ).",0
"While the Mustang isn't among that list of cars, it certainly is no slouch providing MacPherson struts in the front and a variable rate, Quadra shock rear suspension with Traction Lok rear axle and stabilizer bar.",1
Some of the most fun I've had in this vehicle has been entering the freeways from cloverleaf entrance ramps.,0
"Accelerating around these slightly banked curves as the car holds its line tightly, exhibits the fact that the car has a nicely tuned suspension.",0
The Mustang has very little body roll when attacking corners and curves but unfortunately a large amount of dive and squat is apparent when braking ( slightly or hard ) and accelerating.,0
"With all the torque going to the rear, the GT can be pushed into a fun over steer condition ( with traction control turned off ) and I've rarely encountered under steer.",0
Two times come to mind.,0
"The most surprising and least expected, due to the good weather conditions and low speed, was most likely the result of some glazed blacktop on a two lane road.",0
The other time involved some sand.,0
Under steer does not seem to be much of a problem in this car.,0
"On the whole though, steering is decent and boosted sufficiently at low speeds but not as much at higher speeds providing good road feedback.",1
The steering is tight and linear: a steering wheel input provides an expected vehicle turning output.,0
The wheel is appropriately sized and requires about two and a half turns to go stop to stop ( I'm estimating because I've never really counted ).,1
The wheel has four spokes to provide a comfortable one-handed or two-handed grip.,0
The tilting wheel puts it at the driver's preferred angle.,0
"Unfortunately for me, the top of the wheel slightly obstructs the top of the gauges at my comfortable tilt angle.",0
"The ride is a little rough over broken pavement, expansion joints, potholes and on dirt roads.",0
This can be attributed to the low profile 245/45ZR17 tires and somewhat aggressive suspension tuning.,0
There is a stretch of freeway on my commute that is so bad I sometimes fear the car will rattle apart.,0
"Sometimes, body flex is apparent in the convertible due to the suspension not absorbing all road abnormalities but this can be expected in any convertible.",1
Some axle hop can be brought about when accelerating into a turn from a stop over broken pavement.,0
This is a definite annoying aspect of the solid rear axle.,0
While I still have the stock tires on my car ( Goodyear Eagle ZRs ) they seem adequate and provide decent grip in dry and wet weather.,0
"I probably have about 10,000 miles left on them and then it will be time to get new rubber.",0
I haven't decided what tires I will go with but I probably will not get the OE.,1
"I would like a tire with a little better traction in wet and snowy conditions, if possible.",0
Driver/Passenger Comfort and Miscellaneous Items,0
"When it comes to the quality of cars, I would be considered picky.",0
"Squeaks and rattles drive me nuts and unfortunately, since my Mustang is a convertible, various squeaks and rattles accompany every outing in this car.",0
"If I had to complain about only one thing in this vehicle, this would be it.",0
"The list is quite long: the vibrating door handle inserts, the center HVAC vents rattle, when the blower is on, there is a rattle coming from the passenger foot well, the two rear quarter windows squeak when they're rolled up, there's a squeaking/buzzing, on occasion, from the windshield/dashboard area at speeds around 70/75 mph, there's a rattle from the passenger side A-pillar, there is a rattle coming from the passenger side rear quarter glass area ( sounds like it's inside the body ), when the passenger window is rolled down all the way, the headliner buzzes and lastly when driving at about 40/45 mph with the top up, sometimes there is a buzzing noise that sounds like the vinyl from the top is loose.",0
"Maybe I'm picky but none of these things should occur; though, most of these NVH issues probably would go without notice to an average customer ( which I don't consider myself to be ).",1
"On the whole the car is fairly comfortable to drive, providing decent visibility and fairly comfortable seating with the lumbar support.",0
My back can get a bit sore after driving for greater than two hours which leads me to believe the seats could be better designed.,0
Despite this small annoyance it really is a fun car for long distance driving ( longest nonstop drive I've had is about five hours ) and I hope to get it down to Florida on a future vacation for an extended drive.,0
Some small annoyances but not problems I've noticed in the car include the following: Absence of a floor vent mix selection on the HVAC system ( a defrost floor option is available but I try to minimize my use of this to avoid the parasitic quality of the compressor on the engine during defrost use ).,1
"I wish there was a built-in compass and thermometer in the vehicle; I think it would be nice to have it incorporated with the digital odometer much like the new Explorer; further, two trip odometers would be nice, as opposed to the one offered; the glove compartment is a bit small.",0
"So small in fact that the owner's manual will not fit; because of the space needed to store the top when it's down, the trunk is shallow and not very voluminous; and lastly, as eluded to earlier, the back seat is small and only good for small adults or children.",1
Summary,0
"Despite the small nit-picky complaints I had in the previous section, I am very pleased with this vehicle.",0
"Considering the price, performance, handling, overall fun-to-drive quotient, styling and many nice aspects of the vehicle not yet mentioned including a in-dash 6-CD 400 watt sound system, convertible top, two power points, traction control, glass rear window with a very effective defroster, and decent front seat leg room, this is a great vehicle.",1
"If you're looking for a fun-to-drive, American icon with good power and acceleration, take a look at the Ford Mustang GT.",0
"And, with the looks of the 2005 concept, this vehicle line will continue its success well into the future.",0
Giddy-Up!,0
Ford Mustang 2002 convertible.,0
"A few years ago Ford redesigned the Mustang and gave it back some its mid 1960 classic look, I never really understood Ford's decision to drop the so popular style of the 60's Mustang.",1
I always thought that if Chevrolet could keep the sleek and racing style of the Corvette than why Ford could not have done the same not only for the Mustang.,1
If you notice Ford had also done the for the fantastic T-Bird that lost all its classic styling in the early 70s.,0
The Mustang convertible 2002 does have the look and body that tends to make cars become a classic.,0
Who knows if it will ever be as popular as the original Mustang but it really does not matter because this automobile is a fun sport car to drive.,1
Looking at the interior of the Ford Mustang with the top is down is impressive.,0
I like the beauty of the interior and how all the gages and controls seems to be so compact and easy to read and reach.,0
"The car I drove was equipped with leather trim Sport bucket seats, they are optional for the Mustang 2002 but they certainly make that interior look very special.",0
"Once behind the steering wheel, I did feel a bit cramped in, but after a few minutes I got use to it.",0
The armrest on the front console was at the right level and resting my arm on it brought my hands at the right place on the steering and felt good to hold it.,0
The radio/CD player was an AM/FM stereo with a single in-dash CD player.,0
The sound system is well located on the front console and is fairly easy to understand and operate.,0
I did not think that the sound was as good as it should be but I guess who cares when the top is down and you are going for a early evening summer drive down a scenic country road.,1
"The exterior of this car is really something to look at, not only does it bring back the 60's style but it also gives the 2002 Mustang a look worthy of the new Millennium.",1
The hood and side panels have air scoops and the trunk has a rear spoiler that will give this vehicle a real sport car design.,0
I was not too impressed with the 17 inches aluminum wheels; to me it seems that wires wheels would look so much better with this car.,1
This is something to consider to change in the after market for new Mustang owners.,0
Driving the Ford Mustang 2002 convertible was quite a pleasing experience and one I will remember for quite a long time.,0
If I would be a bit younger I would certainly consider buying one for myself.,0
"The car handle very well on the highway, and you have the feeling that it hugged the road very well.",0
"As for city driving this car is a dream, it is not to big to be a pain to drive around the city and at the same time it is big enough to be noticed.",1
"The Ford Mustang convertible I drove was had a V8 4.6 litter SOHC 16 valves engine, developing 260 horsepower.",0
The transmission was a 4-speed electronic overdrive transmission.,0
It also was equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS,0
"As for the Mustangs of the mid-60's after sitting a while in this car you will start to feel less comfortable but that put aside this is a fun car to own and drive, I believe that the price is right and anyone who buys a 2002 Ford Mustang should have years of pleasure driving it.",0
"I opted for the Focus over a Subaru Legacy ( over $ 20K with safety features I wanted ) and the Toyota Matrix (tiny rear windshield, small cargo ).",0
"I went for ALL the bells and whistles as a consolation and am enjoying the sunroof, the leather, the nimbleness and the overall ride.",0
"As I had to factory-order my 5-speed, there wasn't much negotiating on the price and I think I paid top-dollar.",0
For this reason I was peeved when at 2400 miles my gas light when on which required a trip back to the dealer and a full day in the shop to replace fuel pump.,0
"Now at 12000 miles, she's been problem free since, but I have yet to see better than 30 mpg on the highway.",0
When I bought this car the warranty was only for 3 years/36K miles and I have been weary of that having heard Ford horror stories.,0
"I plan on keeping my bright highway-sign (""grabber"" ) green ( very easy to pick out in a parking lot of silver sedans ) little car at least until it's paid for ( 2006 ), I'm just praying it stays together that long.",0
But that's just my nerves; the car has been great ever since the fuel pump thing.,0
"Resale value will not be in my favor thanks to my preference for a stick, and the legacy of the earlier Focii.",1
"I'm glad I opted for all the extra airbags, because if an SUV ever runs me down, I'll surely need them.",0
The leather has been a helpful feature as my toddler likes to challenge the durability of everything.,0
"This past winter surely put the advancetrac steering system to the test and I must admit I felt very secure on the snowy, sometimes icy roads.",0
Of course I drove like a grandmother whilst all the bigger vehicles with fearless drivers at the helm sped by.,0
"Oh, yeah, cargo is fantastic ( 3 more cubic feet than the Subaru! ) my only complaint is that they bothered to split the back of the back seat, but not the fold up bench, so I can't carry anything long with my kid in her car seat.",1
Funny thing is that it's depicted how I would like it in the owner's manual.,0
Go figure.,0
Wonderful!,0
"Ive had my eyes on the ZX2 since it was introduced, but the last Escort we bought ( in 1999 ) was the 4-door SE Sport, which we still have  after 115K -- shows little obvious wear and were hoping that our new ZX2 will give us similar excellent service.",0
"Our ZX2 has all the options except for leather  we like the smell of leather, but hate to actually sit on the stuff.",0
"The ZX2 is wonderful, but then Ill admit Im enamored with smaller cars, and I see no reason to pay big $ $ $ just to impress the parking valet, also our kids are grown, so the back seat is mostly just for storage on trips.",1
"Before we bought the ZX2 we also looked at the Dodge Neon, the Honda Civic and the Ford Focus.",0
"The Neon was unimpressive, but the Civic was quite nice  just not $ 3-4K nicer, that our local dealers were charging for equivalent options.",1
"We like Fords, but when they replaced the solid little Escort with the Euro-esque Focus ( although both it and the ZX2 we bought, are actually assembled in Mexico ), I had to gulp.",0
"Ive tried to like the Focus, and mechanically theyre on par or better than anything else in this price range -- but I guess my ancestors have been gone from Europe way too long for me to appreciate that wedge-of-cheese look.",0
"I like my cars to look like, well, cars.",0
"So, the ZX2 was the best way to get back to the Escort chassis and drive-train weve grown to appreciate and trust.",0
What a nice surprise.,0
"The ZX2 reminds me of the little Audi I brought back from Germany in the 1980s  although the ZX2s fit and finish is much, much better than I remember from my Audi ( which I also liked very much ).",0
Its a speeding ticket waiting to happen.,0
"Although there is never any doubt that youre in a 4-cylinder car, the ZX2 is noticeably faster than our Escort SE  twin cams, etc. Ive seen 0-60 times under 8 seconds in some articles, and although Ive never timed it, the performance is in the neighborhood of what I recall from my mid-sized 327 Camero  only the ZX2 gets a little over 35mpg on the road ( we usually get better than EPA said ).",1
"Weve had several Escorts over the years ( something over 400K miles worth ), and despite how the consumer publications always try to steer buyers much further upscale, I really think theyre missing the true meaning of value and sport.",0
"Weve had our ZX2 on a couple long trips, and like weve said about our other Escorts ( after driving `em all over the United States, driving for days on end ), if two AARP Land  candidates are comfortable in them  then theyre comfortable ( we seem to drive 30K++ miles every year  but these cars make the going inexpensive ).",0
"Our ZX2 is the most comfortable of the bunch, however.",0
"Except for a timing-belt we pushed to 120Kmiles on a 1994 Escort ( dumb on my part ) and an oxygen sensor at 98K on our `98 Escort, weve had very few maintenance problems whatever with our Escorts.",0
At first the ZX2 was a compromise that seemed to be forced on us because Ford no longer makes the 4-door models.,1
"But now, my only fear is that Ford will soon discontinue the Escort ZX2 line altogether ( I've talked to the factory rep about this ).",0
"I just hope they send the Focus to one of those Hollywood plastic surgeons in the meantime, it badly needs a facelift before Id be as happy with it as our ZX2.",0
"Without a ZX2 on the horizon, that Civic just might be worth the extra $ 3K over the Focus  in the meantime were happily piling the miles on our ZX2.",1
Mitsubishi has finally decided to bring an up to date compact to American shores.,0
The Lancer has been available in other parts of the world for a while so the mechanicals of the car and chassis are reliable.,0
"Additionally, a big plus ( for me at least ) is that Lancers are assembled in Japan.",0
"The first thing you'll notice about the Lancer is that its exterior design stands out from the slightly""jellybean"" Corolla, Civic, and Elantra bodystyles out there.",0
Mitsubishi gave the car crisp lines which establish a clean look.,0
The headlights and integrated turn signal assembly look more European than Asian in origin.,0
"The only area which looks a bit plain would be the tail light clusters, but remember we're talking about a sub $ 16k car, and most other compacts are no better in this regard.",0
Now on to more mechanical matters:,0
"First, the 4G94 2.0L Mitsubishi engine is the smoothest, quietest, 4 cylinder powerplant I have ever driven.",0
"I test drove Focus, Elantra, Protege, and Civic high level trims.",0
The Mitsubishi engine is simply a jewel while running and absolutely puts the Ford Zetec and Hyundai engine to shame.,0
The 5spd manual transmission shifts nicely and has a real 5th gear overdrive which drops the revs for quiet highway cruising.,0
"In 5th gear at 70MPH, the Lancer is only turning approx 2750RPM.",0
"The clutch has a high engagement point compared to other manual tranmission cars I test drove, but it's not a big issue.",1
EPA fuel economy rating is 28/33 with the 5spd manual.,0
However on my first tank I got 33mpg in mixed city/hwy with the A/C on almost all the time.,0
"Considering the car now has only 272 miles on it, I'd say that's pretty encouraging.",0
"Additionally, the Lancer's engine provides very decent off the line punch to get the car moving up to speed.",0
You do NOT have to rev the engine up to near redline in order to achieve satisfying acceleration.,1
The Lancer's chassis is an area that will probably disappoint pocket rocket enthusiasts expecting race car type cornering and go-kart like reflexes.,0
"However, for the rest of us, a Lancer in stock form ( across all trim levels ) provides a quiet, comfortable, controlled ride across a variety of pavement surfaces.",0
"Handling is not sloppy, but probably a bit behind the Protege.",1
"Protege is much more controlled during quick cornering, but at the expense of a somewhat harsh and jittery ride - especially on bad pavement.",0
"The Lancer OZ is supposed to be a bit more sporty, but doesn't have anything mechanically to""kick it up a notch"" in the handling department versus the LS or ES trims.",0
The only chassis related complaint I have is that the power steering is overboosted at low speed and the suspension allows a bit more body roll that I would normally like.,0
"My Lancer came with Goodyear Eagle LS tires, which are a pure passenger car tire with no performance inclination.",1
"If there was a weakest link on my OZ as delivered, this would be it.",0
Brakes are front ventilated disc / rear drum and provide sufficient stopping power for normal duties.,0
"All the other cars I've mentioned with the exception of the Protege ES use a disc/drum setup, but it would have been nice if Mitsubishi had installed four wheel disc brakes ( on the OZ at least ) for increased stopping power.",0
"The only quirk is that Mitsubishi only offers ABS on the Lancer LS trim level, it's not available on the ES or OZ.",1
"To sum it up, when you drive the car under normal use, it's amazingly smooth and refined.",0
You simply feel as if you have a larger car beneath as you go down the road.,0
"Body rigidity is excellent which supports very low NVH ( noise, vibration, and harshness ) levels that the auto journalists are always checking on.",0
"Interior design-wise, Mitsubishi provides a very roomy interior within a small size car.",0
"I believe they probably stole a little space from the trunk to give to back seat passengers, but if I have three friends in the car, I think they'd appreciate it.",0
The material( s ) quality is good overall for the price range of the car.,0
I would rate front seat comfort as very good - I'm 6'3 and 245lbs and long legged.,0
The driver's seat goes far enough back that I can stretch out while driving and a dead pedal is provided for your left foot for even more comfort.,0
"There is plenty of leg room for rear seat passengers, no matter how the front seats are adjusted.",1
The benefit of the OZ for me was that a slightly upscale black interior is used with nice looking black fabric cloth for the seats.,0
Otherwise you'd be stuck with the typical light grey or tan interiors available in Asian cars.,0
Another nice perk for the OZ is that the gauge cluster is styled after Mitsubishi's Evolution rally car.,0
"Gauges are creme faced, round, easy to read, and glow a soft orange/red at night for easy visibility.",0
I just traded my 2001 Toyota 4x4 4Runner in on my new Lancer.,0
I am going to grad school and wanted to get a much more economical car that was more suited to my needs.,0
"After a week with my new Lancer OZ, I've gotten all that and much more, including a vehicle which is fully paid off.",0
"If you're in the market for a new compact, you'd be negligent if you didn't go to your Mitsubishi dealership to at least test drive a new Lancer.",1
I'm sure that Honda and Toyota loyalists may decree that Mitsubishi doesn't have the goods to compete since they're the more established players in the arena.,1
"However, a quick test drive may enlighten you to the fact that Mitsubishi has done their homework here and at the very least now offer a product on par with their Japanese rivals.",0
The 2002 Acura 3.2TL is an excellent value.,0
The only option is a DVD-based navigation system that holds the entire US map on one DVD disc.,0
The features that are optional on other cars in this segment are standard here.,0
Value,0
The list of standard equipment is very long.,0
"ABS, traction control, automatic transmission with manual shifting capability, automatic climate control, leather and simulated wood trim, keyless entry, security system with panic alarm, Bose stereo system with both CD and cassette, heated power front seats, cruise control, power locks, windows and mirrors, steering wheel mounted radio controls, high intensity headlights, cruise control, sunroof, alloy wheels, front and side airbags.",0
"I did not include other small goodies like grid antenna and leather gear shift knob and steering wheel, etc.",1
Engine,0
The engine is 3.2 liter V-6 with Hondas VTEC variable valve timing and lift technology that uses two-lobe camshafts and switches between lobes depending on the engine RPMs to increase torque and power.,0
This V-6 produces 225 hp and 216 lb-ft of torque.,0
"There is a new TL Type-S model that gets 260 hp, has 17"" 5-spoke wheels and stiffer suspension.",0
The engine requires premium gas and the fuel economy is 19 mpg city / 29 mpg highway.,0
Transmission,0
"The car is not available with manual transmission, but you can shift the standard 5-speed automatic manually if you wish.",1
"Unfortunately, automatic transmission, even with manual shifting, is no substitute for manual gearbox  the torque converter eats  some power plus you still have less control.",1
"If you hit the rev limiter, it upshifts, even if you don't want it to.",1
Mash the pedal and it downshifts.,0
What's the point of having manual control then?,0
"However if you drive in heavy traffic a lot, the auto will be quite useful.",0
Styling,0
"Some people might like it, but I would prefer something more distinctive.",0
"Although the exterior was improved recently, the rear is still bland.",0
"Interior is nice, however, except the steering wheel that looks too bulky and the wood that looks too fake.",1
The fit and finish are very good and materials look fine for the price.,0
The instrumentation cluster is excellently lighted at night and the HID headlights provide enough illumination.,0
The cabin space is aplenty and ride comfort and visibility are great.,0
"The car employs a floor-mounted parking brake, which I dont like.",1
Its A Front Drive Thing,0
"The TL is a front-driver, which makes it better suited for slippery conditions.",0
The torque steer is virtually nonexistent.,0
"The acceleration is quite fast, however the automatic transmission""eats"" some power.",0
"In fact, BMW and Audi manage to go faster with less power.",0
It might be due to the gearing and weight.,0
"However, I would nt call TL slow  it is faster than a lot of cars in its price range.",1
Safety And Pricing,0
"Although, a lot of safety equipment is standard, what really counts is how car withstands the crash.",0
"If you go to crashtest.com,",0
"you will see that TL was rated worse than it s German competition  Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Benz C-class.",0
"However, they are substantially more expensive in their higher trims ( A4 3.0, 330 and C320 ) with the same equipment as TL.",0
"The lower trim levels ( A4 1.8T, 325 and C240 ) have less power, substantially less equipment",0
"The Lexus IS300 is probably TLs closest competitor, yet IS300 is better suited for younger people who want a sporty car.",0
IS300 is a rear-wheel drive and I think it lookos better.,0
"The TL is a car for those who want good value, reliability and comfort.",0
Bottom Line,0
"Overall, the TL is a good value with lots of standard equipment and smooth engine.",0
But styling and the crash protection could be better.,0
I bought the new Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally model in February 2002.,0
"My car is silver and since it's the OZ model, it has all the upgrades: rear spoiler, racing console, metal rims, upgraded interior, cd player with 4 speakers, and leather wrapped steering wheel and gear shift.",0
"All that for $ 18,000.",0
"And since I accepted the 3-year financing plan, I have 0 % interest.",0
So every payment I make goes straight to principal.,0
You just can't beat a deal like that!,0
My car before that was a 2002 Nissan Sentra that I drove until it died.,0
"This was my first brand new car ever, and I couldn't be more pleased.",0
"When I started shopping for a new car, I also considered another Nissan Sentra or an Altima, a Mitsubishi Galant, or a Honda Civic.",0
"I didn't like the plainness of the Sentra, the Altima seemed too big and""old"", the Galant was too expensive for my budget, and the Civic just didn't offer the extras that the Lancer did at the same price.",1
"I also liked the Lancer because it was the right size for a 5'4"" female.",0
I didn't feel like I was driving a tank.,1
The thing I like most about the Mitsubishi cars is that you don't have to pay for each option separately.,0
"Each model and trim comes with it's own set of options, so you don't end up with sticker shock by the time you pick out what you want.",0
"The Lancer is new to the U.S. and it's reliability is still uncertain, but all the other Mitsubishi cars have proven to be reliable and I have faith in Mitsubishi's name.",0
The car drives very smoothly and has a fair amount of pick-up.,0
It can handle speeds up to 90mph without any jiggles or rattles ( and probably more but I haven't gone that fast ).,1
"The gas mileage is 28-32 miles per gallon ( wonderful! ) and although the car is among the smaller models, it's still comfortable enough for 4 people.",0
"If I could go back and do it over, I wouldn't change a thing.",0
There is nothing about the car that displeases me in any way.,0
Spring has arrived along the Gulf Coast.,0
I'm rolling west out of Houston along I-10 in a riot of color.,0
"Carpets of bluebonnets line the roadsides, as yet unsullied by the inevitable amateur photographers and those families in their finery.",0
Here and there I spot clumps and clusters of primrose in pale pink evening gowns; brilliant yellow coreopsis and purple henbit lurk in the median as if embarrassed to pit their tiny flowers against the showy'bonnets.,0
"In the shade of an overgrown fencerow I catch glimpses of the winy tones of a stand of claret cups; simple fuchsia heads like wineglasses waving on slender stems; and over yonder a prickly phalanx of California poppies has invaded from a nearby pasture, long, fuzzy dark green stems crowned by delicate white petals around a lotus-like core.",0
"On hillside and meadow alike, the Indian paintbrush nod wisely, shafts of color ranging from startling orange to fire-engine red waving contentedly in the humid breeze.",0
"Overhead a squadron of turkey buzzards circles lazily above some carrion buried in the tall grass, flying in a perfect missing-man formation.",0
"As for me, I'm fighting a well-nigh uncontrollable urge to roar off the pavement, spraying mud left and right and sending battalions of Ladybird Johnson's legacy to their heavenly reward.",0
"As I resist the urge, I keep wondering:"" Does Nissan install a testosterone dispenser as standard equipment in the Xterra?""",0
Is this the Ultimate Boy Toy?,0
"Immediately on seeing your first Xterra you know that every inch of the vehicle breathes essence of (young ) male, from the buffed, muscular body to the simple lines of the manly interior.",0
The standard roof rack might as well be a backwards-billed baseball cap; that strange flat spot on the rear hatch is a precise analog for the perfect circle imprinted on ten million teenage boys' wallets.,0
"There's no question at all that Nissan aimed this vehicle, with laser targeting, at a youthful male market.",1
"Unlike Honda and Toyota (among others ) whose smallest SUVs ride on a car platform, Nissan has built the Xterra around the frame of its Frontier pickup.",0
"It's a meaty, beaty, big and bouncy bruiser of an SUV, positioned squarely to take over the Jeep Wrangler market from the sixteen-to-twenty-six age group.",0
"The brutish good looks of the Xterra - tall and slender, with a two-step roofline and what looks like an over-engineered roof rack - should serve it well in that market.",0
The pot's sweetened by a passel of wild colors - who among us has yet to see a canary yellow model on the streets?,0
"- and a standard 100-watt stereo with CD, tinted windows, ABS, and anti-skid plates; also aimed to please.",0
"Throw in the optional first aid kit ( it screams,""Xtreme Sportsman Here!"" ), 300-watt six-disc in-dash CD changer, and - the piece de resistance - the new-this-year 210-hp turbocharged V6 engine, and the teenage boy inside us will be in seventh heaven!",0
Not for Everybody?,0
The very features that make the Xterra boy-bait probably place serious limits on its popularity outside the target audience.,0
"With the disappearance of station wagons and the waning popularity of minivans, the SUV has become the new family cruiser for Sunday afternoon rides in the country.",0
"Families, however, tend to like their creature comforts: car-seat latches, two cupholders for every seat, DVD players that drop from the ceiling, six-way adjustable chairs, and -- above all - a cushiony ride.",0
"The Xterra is definitely not aimed at this crowd, neither its creature comforts nor its ride.",1
"You say you want a small SUV with a smooth, quiet ride?",0
Have you tried the Toyota Highlander yet?,0
' Cause the Xterra's not what you're looking for!,1
The Driving Experience,0
"I put about 450 miles on a four-wheel drive Xterra XE ( the base trim level ), with the stock four-speed automatic and 2.4-liter ( 140-hp ) 4-cylinder power plant.",0
"If anybody cares, it was silver.",0
"Again, if anybody cares, I got about 18MPG for mainly highway driving...",0
"I engaged the shift-on-the-fly 4WD only for a trip down my driveway, though I probably could have used it a few times in downtown Houston's interminable road construction.",0
"Handling is intended to be fun - and it is, as long as you're going fairly slowly.",0
There's a reason all Nissan's commercials show the Xterra grinding up the countryside instead of rockin' down the highway.,0
"The Xterra turns on a relative dime at low speed, which can be a blessing in true off-road situations ( or on Milam in downtown Houston ).",0
"At higher speeds, the steering has a tendency to wander on smooth roads, especially if the surface is a tad slick; and its high profile gives the vehicle just a hint of tippiness through high-speed turns.",0
The ride... what can you say about the ride... truck-like?,0
bouncy?,0
not unlike a Kenmore washing machine with an unbalanced load?,1
"Well, I said the Xterra's not intended for families, and if you're worried the kiddies'll get whiplash, this is one truck to avoid!",1
"Be prepared to buckle up firmly, for this truck can put you through the wringer on rough pavement.",0
"The little four-banger had great difficulty shoving around the Xterra's 4300-pound carcass, with lousy acceleration and a great deal of noise.",0
"Under acceleration, the engine howls like a lovesick hyena; even at a steady speed the poor baby sounds like a rhino with a bellyache - that's assuming you can hear it over the abundant road noise and the howl of the wind in the roof rack ( fairing or no, it's darned noisy ).",1
The automatic transmission spent about as much time hunting for the proper gear as it did performing quietly.,0
This is definitely not the proper configuration for a truck this size and weight - purchasers are well advised to at least spring for the 170-horse V6 ( which is also rumored to be gutless ) if not the turbo version.,1
"The driving position is high - heck, everything is high, including the cargo bed, which hits this 5'11"" guy right at Gluteus maximus level ( I'd hate to have to load anything heavy into an Xterra ).",0
"Although you're up there with a good all-around view of the road, the 2002 model updates include a 2-inch bulge on the hood ( to make room for the optional turbocharged V6 ) that cut down on my front view; it's probably even worse for shorter drivers.",0
My rental came equipped with step bars and lots of grab handles to help the less nimble clamber aboard.,0
"In a bit of inspired styling ( form over function, I'spect ), the rear door handles are mounted high on the door behind the window - let's see your average six-year-old operate those!",0
Critter Comforts and Car-Driver Interface,0
"The stock six-speaker AM/FM/CD player ( no tape ) puts out above-average sound, but the climate-control system seemed just a little overwhelmed at times - and summer's still a long way off!",1
"Nissan has gone all-out to give the cockpit a kicky look, including retro-looking climate-control knobs ( straight off a 1930s gas stove ) and bizarre little three-LED indicator lights.",0
The triple-headed instrument panel ( derivative of the PT Cruiser if you ask me ) has good sight lines so you can notice that Nissan - being different again - uses an italic typeface on the gauges.,0
"The parking brake is mounted beneath the dashboard on the left side - those of you who've had ACL surgery are forewarned, the left knee has to approach shoulder level to operate it.",0
"The brake release, though, is at the right side of the steering wheel.",0
Why? Don't ask me...,1
"Seating is mediocre at best; the padding a bit sparse for these old bones ( but then again, I'm about twice the target age ).",0
"Headroom is great all around, plus the cargo area is advertised as the largest in its class - and I believe it.",0
The cargo area comes with a tonneau cover for hiding the contents; it seemed pretty flimsy and rather awkward to use.,0
Part of the reason the rear sill is so high is a full-size spare mounted beneath the frame ( at least Nissan doesn't stick you with a rolling donut ).,1
"There are numerous cubbyholes - several of probably useless size and placement - on the insides of the doors and around the console, plus a large locking glove compartment.",0
"A single power port graces the dashboard - mine didn't work, by the way - and there's a second inside a generous console compartment.",1
"Two cupholders are molded into the console, their removable rubber boots make'em large enough for a 1-litre bottle.",0
"I wonder, though, how many of the boots get lost?",0
"Also standard on all models are power windows and locks ( another irritant - no keyhole on the passenger door ), remote keyless entry, and cruise control.",1
Overall,0
This baby is in no way intended to compete with luxury SUVs like the Lexus / BMW / Mercedes crowd; nor is it a competitor for the small-family dollar with the likes of the CRV / RAV4 / VUE.,1
It's designed for and aimed at that subset of the market that actually gets off the pavement once in a while - as is abundantly clear from Nissan's advertising.,0
"The truck frame gives the Xterra good towing capability, but the tradeoff is an uncomfortable ride at highway speeds.",0
"Handling is good at lower speeds, mediocre on the highway.",0
The stock 4-cylinder engine and automatic transmission are a waste of your time.,0
"Given the weight of the truck, it amazes me that Nissan would even offer a four, especially when competing head-to-head with the peppy 3.7L V6 in the Jeep Liberty.",0
Nissan as a company has a good reputation for reliability; in its third model year the Xterra also appears to be holding up well.,0
"I should note that my rental - which was delivered with 10K miles on the clock - had already had a couple of plastic parts break, though, and the dashboard power port was on the fritz.",0
Many of the plastic parts seemed pretty cheesy.,0
"Still, Datsun / Nissan has put out durable, long-lasting trucks for decades.",0
Recommendations,0
"This is in no way a family car, unless your family consists entirely of adolescent males.",1
The washing-machine ride and amenity-poor interior are a dead giveaway that SUV isn't intended for hauling around groceries; it's built to carry mountain bikes and snowboards and get them where they can be used.,1
"You can get into a base-level model Xterra on the cheap, though getting 4WD and enough power to get out of your own way requires significantly more outlay of cash.",0
"For the class of cars it represents, the stock 4WD is at best average.",0
"That gutless four-cylinder engine and automatic transmission pairing are downers, particularly given the unimpressive gas mileage for the four.",0
"Upgrading to the stock V6 is apparently marginally better, though reviewers are waxing rapturous over the potential of the V6 turbo.",0
"The ride is awful, but that's the hallmark of a truck-based SUV.",0
"You buy these things'cause you want to get off the beaten path, not because you need something"" classy"" to drive to opening night at the Met.",1
It's better suited to hauling - either in the cargo bay or on a trailer - than it is to elegance.,0
"Based on my driving experience and the potential of the V6, I rate the Xterra a provisional four stars.",0
"Be forewarned, though, that your driving experience can be diminished by that doggy four-cylinder engine, so the four-cylinder version only gets three.",0
Fair enough?,0
"A few years ago, my husband started a real estate development company with a partner.",0
Our new hobby has become driving around the countryside looking for undiscovered tracts of land off of which we can become rich.,0
"Yeah, we are still looking.",0
Sometimes that search takes us off the beaten path.,0
"When you are looking to design a subdivision, chances are there aren't any roads put down.",0
This is what prompted us to get the Xterra.,0
It's an SUV without breaking the bank.,1
We are a Nissan family.,0
"In our 8 years of marriage, we've bought three, all brand new, and they've never given us a minute's worth of trouble.",1
The Xterra is no exception.,1
"We give it the standard oil change, and any general maintenance, and it gives us a good ride each time.",0
Another attribute I like about the Xterra is that it is pleasant looking.,0
"It has got a very distinctive shape and has always caught my eye while we were out, even before we were owners.",0
The colors for this line of SUV's is so bright and sassy.,0
"I've liked almost every one I've seen, but we chose the blue one, as it is my son's favorite color.",0
"While I've seen many women driving it, you ( or your man ) won't look like a sissy in this truck.",1
What's under the hood?,0
"Just a V-6 engine, nothing spectacular.",0
"This means little to me, but I will tell you this: If you are trying to pass someone on a 2-lane, allow plenty of room.",0
"If you are trying to beat someone at a red light, make sure you are next to a little old lady before trying it.",0
"But hey, did you buy this thing for speed?",0
"No, and it isn't a strong point.",1
But it does handle nicely.,0
"We had a fair share of snow in North Carolina this year, and the Xterra got us through in every situation.",0
"And we tested it; my daughter was born New Year's Eve 3 months early, so she had to stay in the NICU nursery for 2 months before coming home, which was about 20 miles from our house.",0
We only missed one day of seeing her due to snow.,0
Now perhaps you can understand my loyalty to this SUV?,0
Here's my Xterra's dirty little secret though: It eats gas.,0
"I have never driven another SUV ( I'm thinking Suburban, Navigator, Explorers ) so can't compare it to them, but it gobbles it quicker than my Maxima.",1
"If we are on the highway, it may get close to 20 miles to the gallon, but I'd say normal driving is only going to get you 16-17 miles to the gallon.",0
Ouch!,0
"When you are inside the Xterra, the feeling of gliding on glass is not one you'll have.",1
"I suppose this is all a matter of perspective, but being compared ( again ) to the Maxima, I have to say my bottom hurts.",0
"But hey, this is an SUV, folks.",0
Another little add on was the trailer hitch.,0
"Apparently, this too is an extra that you must request.",0
We have yet to haul anything ( to my knowledge ) so I can't comment on it.,0
"I will say that the trailer hitch cover comes""unhitched"" often and is a minor annoyance to the aforementioned anal-retentive husband.",0
Inside is what I like to call sufficient.,0
"I drive a Maxima with a lot of frills, so I do feel like I'm roughing it a little when I drive the Xterra.",0
"The seats are canvas, and can be removed and hosed down.",0
"Not that my anal-retentive husband would allow his truck to get that dirty, but nice to know it can be done.",1
One nice extra is the CD player in the front.,0
"It is one that you feed from the front, not a changer, but that's not necessarily a drawback to me.",1
"I will freely admit that the CD changer in the trunk is more convenient, but you certainly get more selection ( providing you bring your CD collection ) with the front loading CD player.",0
"The radio has a memory for up to 18 stations, more than we can actually get around here!",0
The speakers are sufficiently loud and clear.,0
Do you smoke?,0
Not in my car!,1
We don't have an ashtray!,1
"You must pay extra for it to be a"" smoking"" vehicle.",0
"Also, in the place where lighters usually are is just an empty cap over the AC outlet.",0
"You may use these to plug your cell phone in, or to plug up your portable DVD for the kids in the back-seat.",0
"Speaking of kids in the back-seat, this little truck actually has lots of leg room...for kids.",0
"While it doesn't have as much as my Maxima, the kids ( OK, Ty as Mary Ashley is only 5 months old ) like taking the Xterra because they are seated up so high that they can see out so much better.",1
"The seats are individual, though bench seats, which come with a third seatbelt in the middle.",0
"You may also push down one of the seats, or both, to allow yourself more trunk room.",1
This trunk is where your extra storage comes into play.,0
"You are not as confined by an enclosed trunk, so can find more space to stuff your stuff.",1
"Also, there is a luggage rack on top, which we will use for the first time this summer.",0
"And speaking of room, this little dilly isn't as big as it looks.",0
"In fact, we take this truck on our 11-hour trek to Florida each year, and I get to squirming pretty quick.",0
"I had a back surgery a few years ago and it is hard for me to sit straight up, but that's just what these seats do.",0
"You can manually lean your seat back, but I've never found that comfort spot.",1
I'm either up too straight or laying too flat.,0
My other complaint is with the seatbelt.,0
"For some reason, this one locks against your chest if you move too much ( and for me too much is leaning up to change the radio station ).",0
"It also creeps up along my neck, which my Maxima doesn't do, so I know it is not just me!",1
"As confined as I feel in this car, it is obviously made for tall people.",0
"I had to really learn how to get into this darn thing gracefully, and I'm almost 5'9"" tall.",0
"I can hardly complain though, since this very feature allows us to actually see over some cars in front of us, and besides, the truck comes with a tubular rail on the side to help you up, anyway.",0
"It's an SUV, people!",0
"If you are looking for a manly vehicle, you just can't go wrong with a Nissan.",0
"I've never been disappointed with any of their products, and the Xterra is no exception.",1
The folks at Nissan must really be in the business of shooting themselves in the foot.,0
Why do I say that?,0
"Surely not because they are starting to manufacture cars that are worth buying: Nissan vehicles across the board have received more power, feature content, and even attitude.",1
"No, where they seem to make things difficult is by making cars that are so good, you'd think twice before buying another more expensive Nissan model.",0
"Take the Xterra, for instance.",0
"True, it's a different SUV compared to the Pathfinder, but until its introduction, the Pathfinder was the only SUV option buyers had.",0
I wouldn't be surprised if the Xterra had siphoned off a few Pathfinder sales.,0
Enter the new Altima.,0
"Up until now, Nissan had remodeled the Altima into oblivion, making it a ho-hum choice.",0
Definitely worlds beneath the new Maxima.,0
"Now, though, things are different.",0
I'll tell you right off the bat: I really liked the Altima.,0
So much so I'd be hard-pressed to shell out the extra dough for a Maxima.,0
"My schedule has been really hectic, but I still made it a point to go drive a manual V6.",0
Here are my impressions...,0
EXTERIOR: 8,0
Let's just say this car's new look is a head and shoulders improvement over the previous iteration.,0
"Big, too... the wheelbase is 7.1 inches longer, its overall length bumped up by 5.7 inches.",0
The body is 1.3 inches wider with wider tracks front and rear for better stability.,0
Height was increased by 2 inches for more cabin space.,0
"On the inside, the cabin is 9.8 cubic feet larger than the last generation.",0
The body has been tweaked to have over 70 % improvement in torsional rigidity.,0
"Plenty of sound insulation has been added to this vehicle, too.",0
The overall appearance of the new Altima strikes the observer in a completely different way than the old one did.,0
""" Me too"" quasi-luxury styling could be seen in the old model, whereas this model looks like it could actually make good on such a promise.",0
This impression hit me hardest when I saw one parked next to a VW Passat.,0
"Not only is the new Altima about as large as the Passat, but it looks just as upscale if you look at it from the right angle.",1
IT looks well put-together and solid all around.,0
And I'm particularly fond of the clear tail lights that just seem to make sense on this body.,0
"So, with all these compliments why not a 9 or 10 rating?",1
"This part is harder, less tangible, and all a matter of personal preference.",0
"From some angles, the Altima seems a little porky-looking rather than muscular... the bubble-butt in the rear comes to mind.",0
"While the car is much more of a looker than the old model, it didn't really speak to me.",0
"See? It's hard to explain, so I leave this rating up to you.",0
INTERIOR: 9,0
"I've already made references to interior space, and when you sit in the car, you'll see what I mean.",0
"The rear seat is cavernous with the front seat moved forward for a short-statured driver, and head/shoulder/hip room is generous front and rear.",0
"The trunk is large, too, with around 15.6 cubic feet inside.",0
Let's start off with the most important stuff...,0
I loved the eight-speaker Bose audio system!,0
"Large well-placed controls made it easy to use, and the in-dash six-CD changer was a real nice touch.",0
"The steering wheel controls were a nice perk, though I've read they are not illuminated at night, which is just silly.",1
"After a while though, I had learned how to operate them without looking down.",1
"Overall sound is awesome, with crisp highs and punchy lows sandwiching perfectly balanced mid-ranges.",0
Nissan really knows what they are doing when it comes to stereos.,0
It's even better than the 10-speaker Monsoon stereo I so openly praised in the VW Jetta.,0
That says a lot.,0
"As for interior quality, a few cost-cutting cues can be noted, such as the less-than-substantial feel to the switchgear, and wimpy cupholders.",0
"The leather seats are nice, but won't bring thoughts of Lexus to mind.",0
"Other than that, I'd say Nissan did a great job at making the interior cabin very hospitable to both the driver and passenger.",0
"Having sat in the Acura CL's heavenly seats, I have begun to notice that not many cars offer enough side-bolstering.",1
The Altima could use some more.,0
"The gauge cluster is easy to read, and looks like it belongs on a more expensive car.",0
"All the controls are well-placed, intuitive, and within reach.",0
Both Car and Driver as well as Edmunds.com,0
"have complained about sun glare coming from the windshield, which I didn't notice, even after searching for it.",1
"The automatic climate control system works great, though I would have liked to see a dual-zone, seen in the Pontiac Grand Prix, for instance.",0
There are plenty of nooks and crannies to store your stuff in.,0
Even the cup holders double as a storage space if you don't need them for... cup holding.,1
"The 60/40 split-folding rear seat increases cargo carrying capacity, but you neeed to go around the back to do it.",0
"The hinges on the trunk are of the luggage smushing variety, as opposed to the hydraulic hinges found on the VW Jetta and Honda Accord.",0
ENGINE: 8,0
The Altima comes with two engine flavors: the base is a 2.5-liter DOHC 16-valve four-cylinder that churns out 175 hp and 181 lb-ft of torque.,0
"The second, more enticing flavor is the on the 3.5SE model.",0
"It uses the same 3.5L V6 as the Maxima, though toned down a bit, producing 240 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque.",0
"I drove the latter of these two choices, accompanied by a manual transmission.",0
"The engine itself is a gem, revving very smoothly and producing a satisfying growl when pushed.",0
"Acceleration has been clocked at 6.3 seconds 0-60, and you can definitely feel this urgency off the line.",0
"Highway passing is easy, too.",0
"Oh, and did a mention that this car comes with a 20 gallon gas tank and has pretty decent gas mileage even when driven hard ( like I did )?",0
My complaint is with the friggin' manual shifter.,0
"Throws are longer than I like, and it's not easy to tell when you've actually engaged the desired gear.",1
This is possibly the first car in which I would probably prefer an automatic transmission.,0
"It's a shame, too, because I was really hoping to give this engine a higher rating.",0
RIDE: 9,0
"With a multi-link suspension taken from the Infiniti Q45, this car rides very comfortably.",0
"Outside sounds are well-muted, and road irregularities are well-dampened.",0
"The SE provides just enough feedback to feel sporty, too.",0
I really don't have many complaints about this suspension.,0
It serves well in a family hauler and enthusiast setting.,0
What more can you ask for than that?,0
HANDLING: 7,0
The Altima impressed me here.,0
"Body roll is hardly evident, and braking is equally strong ( though I felt the brake pedal to be slightly spongy on the way up - probably a new car thing ).",0
"My usual"" cloverleaf test"" was handled with poise and confidence.",0
I even pushed the gas just a little more to challenge the car and was not disappointed.,1
"Overall, this car is a hoot to drive, yet has the balance of a car with a totally different purpose, like taking the kids to school.",0
"Although the Altima performs admirably in the hard corners and is fun to drive, it has its drawbacks.",0
"For example, what's up with the steering?",0
"All of the"" sport"" that the car promises practically goes out the window.",0
"Put simply, this steering feels like it belongs on a mini-van.",0
"It is completely non-communicative, and requires many corrections on the highway.",0
"It has no real weight to it, as if the assisted steering is assisting too much.",1
Understand what I mean here?,0
"Anyway, it was pretty disappointing and is the only reason why I didn't give the handling over a seven.",0
SAFETY:?,0
"The model I drove was equipped with the"" ABS/Airbag Package"", which included ABS, dual front and side airbags, as well as front and rear head curtain airbags.",0
"This is all well and good, though I can't rate this car just yet until crash tests have been performed.",1
I'll change my rating as soon as the tests are done.,0
"The 2000-2001 Altima scored an"" Acceptable"" rating by the IIHS in its offset tests, and received 4 out of 5 stars for driver and 5 out of 5 stars for passenger frontal crashes.",0
Side impact ratings were lower at 3 out of 5 stars for both front and rear occupants by the NHTSA.,0
RELIABILITY:?,0
"While Nissan usually makes well-assembled cars, this is an introductory year for the Altima.",0
"The engine is fortunately not all-new since it was merely taken from the Maxima and modified, rather than drawn from the ground up.",1
"Other than that, this is a new car, which means a few problems could come up.",0
"Hey, it happens to everyone even the folks at Honda ( read: Honda Odyssey ).",0
VALUE: 9,0
The Altima represents an excellent bang-for-the-buck value.,0
"No, let me rephrase that...",0
"Nissan has really taken the phrase""affordable luxury"" to a whole new plane and should be commended for it.",0
"This car could seriously be sold for a price in the upper twenties, and perhaps an argument could be made to sell it for more.",0
"It essentially comes with all the stuff the Maxima does, but costs less... and here is where I make the joke ( sort of ) that Nissan may have shot themselves in the foot by making such a value-packed yet excellent vehicle ( I had to add""yet excellent"" because sometimes""value-packed"" is hardly complimentary ).",0
"The 3.5SE package offers all your standard fare, most notably the 3.5L V6.",0
"My car also had the leather trim, automatic climate control, Bose stereo system, heated seats/mirrors, and more.",0
"All for around $ 26,000.",0
"That's loaded to the gills, folks.",0
This car can be found nicely equipped in the lower twenties.,0
( Sound like a commercial? ),0
"The jury is still out on whether or not the Altima will have a good resale value, but has always been around average or slightly above so.",1
"Regardless, this car stacks up well against its competitors, such as the Accord, Camry, and Jetta.",0
"In fact, I'd say it is the best value out of all of those listed.",0
"Still, bear in mind this is a brand-new car and you might want to hold off on budget-minded buying for now, as dealers won't be able to resist charging sticker or above sticker until demand goes down.",0
"VERDICT: NISSAN MAKES GOOD ON ITS"" AFFORDABLE LUXURY"" PROMISE",0
"There aren't many cars that provide the same level of comfort, sport, and feature content that the Altima does.",0
Out of the ashes from this totally new redesign has come a mid-size car that has sprung from middle-of-the-pack to the front runners.,0
Is it perfect?,0
"Well no, obviously.",1
There's a few flaws that Nissan should definitely look at... the steering and manual shifter come to mind.,0
But I still come back to my original question: where does this leave Maxima buyers?,0
"For the money, I'd actually buy this car over the Maxima.",0
"Nissan hopes you can see enough of a difference between the two cars by increasing the horsepower rating on the Maxima, but I see right through their desperate move.",0
"Outside the increased horsepower, better steering, and a few nicer quality touches, little separates the Maxima from the Altima... except for several thousand bucks, of course.",0
"For a penny-pincher like me, the Altima would get my vote.",0
AVERAGE SCORE: 8.33 out of 10,0
VARA'S PERSONAL RATING: 8.5 out of 10,0
"During its introduction in 1992 as a'93 model, Nissan boasted all sorts of things about the'new' Altima.",0
Some advertisements had the audacity to claim that the 1993 Altima looked like a Jaguar.,0
"Don't ask me what Jaguar looks like a Nissan Altima, but apparently the person who made that AD knew something I didn't or was in need of prescription glasses.",1
"The 1993 Nissan Altima had many flaws, and so did the 2nd generation.",0
"Finally, I think Nissan really has what it takes, with the 3rd generation Altima to be one of America's top 3 best sellers.",0
Driving Impressions:,0
"The 2002 Nissan Altima comes in 4 trim lines, the 2.5, the 2.5 S, the 2.5 SL, and the 3.5 SE.",0
"Unfortunately I only got to drive a 2.5 S, but this does not mean I was not impressed.",1
"The 2.5, 16 valve, DOHC 4-cylinder is loads more refined over its predecessor.",0
Hesitation is no longer an issue like it was in the 1st and 2nd generation models.,1
"My test Car was a 2.5 S, which offered adequate-borderline strong engine performance.",0
"With 175 horsepower, this comes close to the power that is associated with most V6 engines.",0
"Even with the 4-speed optional automatic transmission ( a 5 speed is standard ) the car moved from the light with no fuss whatsoever, with a slight sporting growl from the single, dual tipped, Exhaust pipe.",1
"Torque for this engine comes in at 181 lb-ft at a relatively low 4,000 RPM, so hill climbing and passing large trucks are accomplished with much less strain than most family cars that are powered by naturally aspirated powered 4-cylinder engines.",0
"Cruising was also very refined, not as quiet as a V6 Accord, but the driver is in a totally hushed environment while cruising at 65 MPH; given a well built freeway.",1
"Handling is a shade more refined over the 2nd generation models, but don't expect to see too much improvement, which is ok, because the Nissan Altima has always been a good car on the twistys.",1
"My test car came with 4 wheel disc brakes with 4 wheel ABS, which assured excellent braking.",0
"This set-up of course was an option, so unless you are willing to pay the cash, you will not see the ABS. 4 wheel Discs although are standard equipment.",1
"NOTE: Expect to get around 28 MPG while doing conservative freeway driving with the automatic, and 29 with the 5-speed.",0
"Also, just to do a little MPG comparison, 28 mpg is less than what a 3.8 liter OHV V6'dinosaur engine' powered Chevy Impala receives.",0
"The Chevrolet Impala is heavier, has more horse power, has a bigger engine, less technology, yet gets better gas mileage, what gives??",0
"All 2002 Nissan Altima's ride on a 110"" wheelbase, this is around 7"" longer than its predecessor.",0
"The overall length of the car is also longer, measuring around 192"".",0
The suspension consists of struts and coil springs.,0
Interior Innovation:,0
"The interior while not being as refined as many other cars on the market, and not having as much standard equipment, was quite surprising.",1
"The dash is a little on the cheap-o material side, but did come with a tachometer and a optional trip computer.",0
"I actually found the interior of the Hyundai Elantra GT, and Kia Sedona to be much more accommodating.",0
There was an'optional' 8 speaker Bose Cd player that sounded excellent.,0
This option came with a convenience package.,0
"For the entire package, which also included AC, cruise control, power everything, and remote keyless entry with leather trimmed seats came close to adding on 3 grand to the sticker price.",0
"Speaking of seats, they were both supportive and comfortable, the driver seat was 8 way power, and the rear seats were of the 60/40 split variety which folded down.",0
"I would give you a comment of the ease of doing that, but I did not get the chance for conversion.",1
"A center console is standard, a micro air filter, and many other amenities are standard, including dual airbags.",0
"The interior is very spacious, and seems much larger than the 1st and 2nd generation Altima's.",0
The cabin offers plenty of room for 5 adults.,0
Exterior Innovation:,0
The exterior ( all new for 2002 ) is much more sleek/sporty over its predecessor.,0
"The 2002 Nissan Altima is fitted with flush mounted headlamps with see-through effects, and are slightly'cat eyed' to give a modern appearance.",0
"The same theme is incorporated with the rear lights, only are more triangular.",0
"The 2002 Altima is very'cab forward,' not a new theme by any means, I believe the 1986 Ford Taurus was one of the first designs to be considered'cab forward.'",1
"From the side of the Altima you will undoubtedly notice that the rear is higher than the front, and will notice the sloping roofline.",0
This car is the sexiest Altima yet!,0
"Price, Warranty, and Reliability:",0
"For 2002, a base Nissan Altima will run you around $ 15,000 with just standard equipment.",0
"With options however the price rises quite dramatically, the price on my test car was just over $ 20,000, and this was not even the 3.5 SE model.",1
"Both the 2.5 liter 4 banger, and the V6 are both new for 2002 so it's way too early to comment on reliability, but if anything happens to your car at the manufactures fault, it's covered under a, 3 year 36,000 bumper to bumper warranty and a 5 year 60,000 mile powertrain warranty.",0
Let me start by saying that Im not a car person.,1
"I view driving as a necessary evil, and a car is just the thing that I sit in while I am forced to drive.",0
"When it s time for me to buy a car I figure out my price range, look in Consumer Reports to see which cars in that range get the best ratings for safety and reliability, and then pick the ones that look good to test drive.",0
Ill never be a car person.,1
That being said let me tell you that I absolutely love my 2002 Nissan Altima!,0
"Ive owned the car for almost three months now, and Im still as excited about it as I was when I drove it off the dealers lot.",0
"Im almost embarrassed to admit this, but there are times when Im in the garage that I have to stop what Im doing just so that I can take a moment to admire my car.",0
I have even stopped in parking lots and said to myself Wow!,0
Thats a good looking car!  only to realize that it s mine!,0
"If this car can get me excited, it s definitely worth writing about!",0
"Before I get into the details, please know that I dont know much about engines, suspension systems, and brakes.",0
I cant explain the technical workings of the car.,0
"Luckily, you dont need me for that.",0
"The Nissan Website http://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/ModelHomePage/0,9438,20700,00.html",0
and your local dealer can give you plenty of technical information ( note that the website now details the 2003 Altima ).,0
"What I can share is my own unique experiences with the car  why I am so thrilled with my choice, and the few things that Nissan could do to make next years model even better.",0
First - a bit of history.,0
"I got my drivers license at 17, but did nt own a car until I moved to Florida at the tender age of 32.",0
My first car was a sporty Acura Integra.,0
"At the time, my employer was paying for the car, so I leased.",0
"I really liked the Integra, but when the lease was up, I chose not to buy it for several reasons, the most relevant being that I wanted a larger six cylinder car.",1
"The Integra had only four cylinders, and sometimes while merging onto highways it gave me cause to pray!",0
"Florida drivers are known to be rude and to drive fast, and quick pick-up is required for anyone doing a lot of highway driving.",0
I turned in the Integra and bought a Honda Accord V6.,0
It is a great car and I had no problems with it.,1
"Meanwhile, my husband had been driving Denty.",0
Denty was our 1989 Nissan Maxima.,0
"The car was nt beautiful, but it never gave us a moment of engine trouble.",1
It got the name Denty  four years ago when someone sideswiped my husband.,0
The entire drivers side was smashed.,0
"Denty had some issues  after the accident  only three doors worked, only one window worked, the air conditioned sometimes got temperamental, the sun visor had been ripped out, but the engine was a finely tuned machine!",0
"When a fender-bender finally killed  Denty at 180,000 miles, we were completely sold on Nissan as the maker of reliable cars.",0
We went to look at new Nissans.,0
"Unfortunately, I did nt like the look of the new Maxima, and the car was priced out of my desired range.",1
"The Altima, on the other hand, looked great!",0
I remember the first time I saw the new Altima.,0
"I loved the silhouette of the car, and the shape of the tail lights.",0
"The car looked large and comfortable, yet sleek and sporty.",0
"The price range on the new Altima, however, was outrageous, with sticker prices starting under $ 17,000 and top of the line models selling in the low $ 30,000s.",0
"Quite frankly, I was confused.",0
Altima offers 3 basic models:,0
The 2.5 S is the basic car.,0
"It boasts a 175 horse power engine, 4-cylinders, cloth seats, AM/FM/CD Audio system, air conditioning and keyless remote.",0
"Consumers seeking to enhance this basic model can purchase the convenience package  which gives them 16 alloy wheels, 8-way power drivers seat adjustments, manual lumbar adjustment, leather-wrapped steering wheel, steering wheel mounted audio and trip controls, automatic on/off headlights, a security system, and some other minor convenience items.",0
"The SL model is also 4 cylinders, and comes standard with all of the items in the convenience package, as well as leather seats, the Homelink Universal Transceiver, and a Bose stereo with 6-CD Changer.",0
Finally there is the 3.5 SE model which features a 3.5 liter V-6 engine.,0
"Strangely, this top of the line  model does not come standard with many of the luxury and convenience items included in the SL.",1
"These and other features can be added on, but that is what drives the price on the 6-cylinder model into the Maxima price range.",0
I think that Nissan designed the packages to be confusing and to force consumers to buy features that they dont really want.,1
"Its not a great system, and it will frustrate many buyers.",1
"I cant defend Nissans marketing strategy, and I will not try to provide the details for all of these packages.",1
"Again, the website and sales brochure can spell out all of the options for you.",0
"Initially, the new car was going to be for my husband.",0
"After driving Denty for years, he had his eye on a more luxurious car like the Maxima or Lexus.",0
I had problems with the price of those cars.,0
"Then, the salesman told us that the 4 cylinder Altima had more horse power than my?",0
"Accord, and that pick up would not be an issue.",1
"All of a sudden we had the opportunity to purchase a great looking, less expensive car that that offered great gas mileage and that would save me gas money on my long commute to work",0
I ended up buying a 4-cylinder SL model.,0
"Its lovely - silver paint with black racing stripes, black leather seats, sun roof, leather-wrapped steering wheel.",0
The car looks sharp!,0
I love the Bose stereo with 6-CD changer!,0
I cant do things and drive at the same time.,0
"Cant drink coffee, talk on the cell phone, or change CDs.",1
"With the 6-cd changer and steering wheel mounted radio controls, I have easy access to many music and radio choices, and the Bose system sounds great ( I even think that my singing has improved since I got the Bose, but youll have to take my word for that ).",0
I am very pleased with the way the car handles.,0
I have no problems accelerating onto the highway or stopping on short notice.,1
The car rides smoothly and comfortably.,0
Its fast and peppy.,0
"I have heard some complaints about the seat comfort, but I am satisfied.",0
"I am short and must raise the seat to its highest height to be comfortable, but the drivers side seat has 8 way electronic adjustments, and it is easy for me to find a comfortable driving position.",0
"I could go on and on about how much I love the car, but I think perhaps it would be more useful for me to focus on the few things that I think Nissan could have done better.",0
"None of these would have changed my decision to buy the car, but there certainly is room for some small improvements.",1
1 ) The center console / arm rest: The arm rest is set further back than in most cars which makes the front seats feel roomier.,0
There is a button that you can pop to push the arm-rest forward so that it can actually be used as an arm rest.,0
"I think the mechanism is a bit flimsy, and the design a little bit silly.",0
"Maybe a taller person could actually use the arm rest, but I cant.",1
The console has no change holder.,1
"Its a minor thing, but I like a change holder in the console or a change cup  on the dash.",0
"In its defense, the arm rest opens into two separate compartments that are useful.",0
A shallow one on top and a deeper one underneath that is large enough to hold CDs.,0
2 ) Power outlet covers: In the deeper section of the center console there is a power outlet.,0
"This is a second outlet ( there is one on the dash ), and it is a nice feature for someone who may want to charge a cell-phone but keep it hidden from view.",0
The power outlet on the dash is located low and to the right.,0
It is in a good location  out of the drivers way.,0
"One thing that I dont like is that the outlet covers are not attached, and therefore, can be easily lost.",1
"I think that Nissan should attach them so that when the outlet is in use, the covers will stay nearby.",0
3 ) Sun visors: The Sun visors are poorly placed too close to the rear-view mirror so that the sun can shine in from the sides.,0
"There are visor extenders, but they are not useable since they would hit or block the rear-view mirror.",1
"If Nissan moved the visors out, away from the center, the visors would be more effective in blocking the sun, and the extenders could be used when needed.",0
4 ) Location of the hazard light button: The hazard light switch is poorly placed low on the dashboard and towards the passengers side.,0
"If were lucky, we dont need to use our hazards often  at least not in dangerous or emergency situations.",1
"Here in Florida, however, we often get horrific rain storms that reduce visibility on the highway.",0
Everyone uses hazards in those storms to help other cars see them.,0
I want the hazard light button to be in a spot that is easy to reach.,0
"In a bad storm or emergency situation, it would be hard to locate the hazard light button without taking your eyes off of the road.",1
Id like to see Nissan move the switch higher up and closer to the drivers side.,0
5 ) Cup Holders: The cup holder is in front of the center console.,0
It is big and roomy and can accommodate two large cups or bottles.,0
"It is, however, too deep for a normal sized coffee cup.",0
"I like the overall design, but I think that Nissan needs to offer some sort of inset to raise smaller cups up and make the holders more user friendly.",0
6 ) Glasses Holder: The car comes with a built in glasses-holder above the rear-view mirror.,0
"I also had this in the Honda, and I really like this feature.",0
The holder in the Altima is designed with a door that folds down to access the glasses.,0
"When the door is down, it completely blocks the rearview mirror.",0
"Granted, the door does not stay down for long, but this is a poor design.",1
"The glasses holder in the Honda rolled open into itself, so that it never blocked the drivers view of the road or mirrors.",1
I hope that Nissan will adopt a similar design for future models.,0
7 ) Side View Mirrors: The side view mirrors are slightly small and taper at the outside.,0
"The car does have fairly significant blind-spots, and I think that larger mirrors would help eliminate the need for the driver to bend and crane  before making lane changes.",0
"8 ) ABS not standard: The car did not come standard with ABS brakes, and, here in Florida it was almost impossible to buy one off the lot with ABS.",1
"In the end, I did not buy a car with ABS, and in Florida, this is probably fine.",1
"If I lived somewhere where we had ice and snow, however, I would insist on an ABS braking system, and I would be irritated to have to pay extra for it as an upgrade.",0
"Now that Ive detailed the cars problems, Ill conclude by saying that I am 99.7 % satisfied with my car.",0
"Despite these few problems, the car has many small and delightful features.",0
The rearview mirror has a built in dimmer which automatically adjusts so that Im not blinded by headlights from cars behind me.,1
The trunk is massive and came with two cargo nets which allow me to keep things neat and organized.,0
The back seat folds down in a 60/40 configuration giving me even more trunk space.,0
The gas tank cover is attached so that it cant be left behind.,1
"The keyless remote not only locks and unlocks the car, but also can roll down the windows to help air out the car on those hot Florida summer days.",0
( Too bad it cant also raise the windows when those sudden Florida summer rain storms hit! ),0
"The headlights have auto-off which I like, but I like even more that they have an auto setting that senses when there is not enough light and puts the headlights on and off automatically.",1
Im getting great gas mileage!,0
"On the highway I get over 31 mpg, and overall Im averaging over 28 mpg ( thats with a commute that is about a 50/50 mix of highway and local driving ).",0
"Ill never enjoy driving, but I do feel comfortable and safe in my car.",1
"It looks great, and it performs wonderfully!",0
"I drive two hours a day to and from work, and the car is a joy.",0
"Coming from me, that is a huge endorsement!",0
"I have driven just about every sports car that is out there - from a Porsche 911, BMW 540i, Jaguar S-Type and even the Subaru WRX.",0
There is something about the driving experience of this Acura that is special.,0
While its true that it is not the best handling or fastest car on the planet... this is one of the very few cars that will give you performance with the reliability issues of the german cars or the spartan comfort of the WRX.,1
The exterior styling is not offensive but can look odd from some angles.,1
"From the side the TLS looks gorgeous, from the back it is quite boring and from the front it may be wierd looking.",0
Someone mentioned a corolla...,0
I kind of see the resemblence of the high beam curve outs a little.,0
"Anyways, I think it should be improved.",0
"If we look at the RL, NSX and RSX we should see that the Acura has largely ignored the TL as far as styling goes.",0
The interior is another picture.,0
I too absolutely love the interior dash.,0
Ergonomics are top-rate.,0
I would preferred real wood but the existing plastic wood does not look as bad as some make it out to be.,1
"The white faced guages are just lovely and""reverse illumuinate"" at night.",0
"The dash has external temperature readout, trip A, trip B, ODO in digital format and various other indicators for VSA ( Vehicle Stability Assist ), Cruise etc. etc.",0
There is also the Sequential Sportshift gear readout which tells you which gear # the Sportshift is currently in.,0
The SportShift feature is without argument the best out there.,1
"It surely beats anything offered by BMW, Porsche or Audi.",0
Acura has done a great job here.,0
Engine response with the SportShift feels quite close to a manual...but of course it can never be as good as the real thing.,1
Since this car is a front wheel drive it suffers from some handling problems like oversteer.,0
Launch spin as someone mentioned is also a problem.,0
"But then again, this car is not exactly a $ 100,000 Porsche 911.",1
"RWD is expensive to manufacture, at the TLs price I think they would have to remove a large chunk of standard equipment if they made it RWD.",0
The HIDs are standard on this vehicle.,0
"HIDs are currently very expensive and not even found standard on a high end Mercedes or BMW, yet Acura offers them standard.",1
They cost somewhere between $ 500-$ 700 itself!!,0
These lights illuminate the road almost like its daylight!,0
The light uses a Xenon gas chamber which is ignited with an electrical arc.,0
This is not just some blue paper over a regular halogen bulb.,1
"The""firing"" of this chamber requires an expensive device called a Ballast.",0
The beam also needs focusing which requires more electronic circuits.,0
When you first turn these lights on you can see the light being focused...it is amazing!,0
"And the blush-white rays look cool too:-) Although the Acura version does not have"" Dynamic Auto Levelling"" which is an even more complicated headlight which is optional on Lexus, BMW, Mercedes etc.",1
The space inside the car is roomy for 4 adults.,0
5 could sit for short distances.,0
The trunk is HUMONGOUS!,0
This car is LONG!,0
The tires need to be wider for the performance of this vehicle.,0
Basically I found this vehicle to be very desirable and offering a lot for the dollar.,0
If you have money to burn you may want to buy a Lexus GS430 or 540i... but for those that want to use their dollars wisely I would highly recommend the TLS.,0
HAHA!,0
"I""upgraded"" to this TLS from a""fully loaded"" BMW 328i about 5 months ago.",0
So I am going to compare this car to the 328i.,0
This will probably give a perspective to buyers who are considering a BMW also...DONT!! DONT! DONT!,0
You may want to look cool...BUT!!!... ITS YOUR MONEY!,0
Its NOT going to be cool when you start shelling out the serious $ $ $ $ for all sorts of BMW service costs!,1
First let me start by saying that I think the BMW is the most overrated pieces of garbage that exists in this universe.,0
Now I may pi$ $ some people off for saying this...but TOUGH!,0
I have owned one for 3 years so I know what I'm talking about.. many of thost who speak so highly of the BMW have never even owned one!!,1
HA! The BMW does not even come with leather standard...or power seats.,1
"So why is it so COOL, because of some idiotic badge on the hood???",0
That is a really stupid way of thinking!,0
"Sure the BMW handles great, but there are other cars that do that too for much less money, enough said!",0
Now for the TLS.,0
This is one heck of a car!,0
I am totally in love with it.,0
Everytime I get behind the wheel this car begs me to drive it to its potential.,0
The acceleration is fabulous.,0
"The auto will do a pretty fine job, but if you want total control you can manually engage the sequential sportshift mode... this provides more fun than should be legally allowed in a automatic transmission vehicle!!!",0
The SportShift SIMPLY BLOWS AWAY the BMW automanual CRAP.,0
The engine response is far better in the Acura.,0
Shifting also feels closer to a manual.,0
The interior is FAR FAR superior to any BMW or Audi I have seen.,0
"It is very modern, the instrumentation is white faced and changes to black at night.",0
The lighting at night is incredible!,0
Other interior materials are terrific.,0
The seats could be a little bit more supportive but overall they are great with the perforated leather.,0
I specially like the sporty headrests...they simply look gorgeous!,0
The storage spaces are plentiful.,0
There are two cup holders in the center console and two HUGE storage compartments under the armrests.,0
There is a coin area and plenty of storage in the door pockets also.,0
The Acura Navigation system is the best out there.,0
"It is very easy to use, accurate and has a plethora of options.",0
The graphics are great.,0
"Now, the voice guidance is a little irritating because it is a shrill Japanese accent ( no offense to anyone:-) But this is inappropriate for the American market!",1
I am told that the voice data is on the DVD so the new DVD release will change that!,0
The BOSE system is pretty good.,0
"I would prefer a little more power/bass but the sound is very clear, there is no distortion even at very high volume.",1
"The body does ding a little too easily, but this happened on my 3 series also.",0
"As for fuel economy, I am getting 20-21 mpg in the city ( perpetual LA stop and go traffic ).",0
This is another amazing feat of Acura engineering...to achieve this in a high compression V6.,0
Obviously you will be using premium fuel on the Type-S.,0
During the time I have owned this vehicle it has not given me a SINGLE problem.,1
"In fact, I need to now go and open the hood because I have not opened it for so long I forgot what the engine looks like:-) But of course I clearly remember what the BMW engine looks like because half the time something was malfunctioning inside!",1
Are there better choices out there for the segment...resounding NO!,0
For any price...Sure!,0
"You could buy a GS430 which is also a FANTASTIC vehicle, but its $ 52K fully loaded, thats a whole $ 20 ( TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS!!! ) more!",0
A world apart in price!,0
"And for those comparing it with the Infiniti I35, NO!",0
The I35 is a very very nice vehicle but it appeals to a completely different type of driver so NO comparison!,1
"The I35 is"" cushier""... more like a Lexus.",0
The Acura is a bit less comfort but more handling!,0
"Finally, I would like to comment on CSXperts review.",0
It is a gross exaggeration of the facts!,0
The ride is a bit firm obviously but it is reasonably comfortable.,0
Everybody with an IQ over 5 knows and thinks this is a VERY COOL car!,0
"Great value, performance, luxury and low maintainence costs!",0
Thank you Acura for coming out with such an OUTSTANDING vehicle!,0
I love this car but unfortunately I have decided that I will sell it in another year as it does not suit my purpose... I am looking at purchasing an SUV.,1
"There is so much debris on the freeway its insane, yesterday I almost ran over a tire...Phew!",0
"I need vehicle that can tough it out and also the 4x4 in the mountains, so maybe a Nissan Pathfinder, QX4 or why not an Acura MDX???:-)",1
After my SAAB story with the 9-5SE ( please see that review for all the gory details ) I decided to return to the warm bosom of reliability and high resale value of Japanese-made automobiles.,0
"Just to rule out alternatives, I drove 15 cars in total.",0
"If you are only interested in the TL, you can scroll down to see the TL review.",0
"The Mercedes C320 ( a disappointment, terrible ride ) Volvo T6 ( very nice car, but still too skittish for a Swedish make )",0
"Audi S4 ( awesome car, but questionable reliability )",0
"Three Lexus models ( RX300-didn't want SUV, IS-300, cool car but no leather option and didn't want RWD, and the GS300, which is a really nice car, but glove compartment-mounted CD player ruled it out )",1
"Toyota Camry, a disappointment, would like to see a sports version ( I'm glad to see they finally updated it, it was overdue )",0
BMW 330xi was nice but way too cramped and questionable reliaiblity.,0
"Mazda Millenia was also nice, but was missing key features and had no significant cost advantage",1
"VW Passat, which I was very impressed with, but again questionable reliability.",0
"Maxima 20th anniversary edition, an awesome car with perhaps the best V6 engine ever made, with a long history, but it had no cost advantage over the Infiniti I30, which was the car that gave the TL a run for the money, but the TL won out with more powerful engine, higher resale and lower insurance costs.",1
"I took delivery in March, of one of the very first TL-S' available.",0
The TL-S is an incredibly FAST car.,0
"I've seen 0-60 numbers in the 6.2-6.3 second range, and I have no trouble believing it.",1
"When I press the accelerator, the 260 horses are ready to run.",0
"It's great for evasive maneuvering, which I've had to use twice.",0
"Once was literally ten minutes after I picked up the car, when an adjacent car literally crashed into the car in front of him, while gawking at my new TL.",0
I swear this is a true story.,0
I almost had a heart attack.,0
"Luckily, none of the flying debris hit me.",1
"As with most Japanese makes, the fit and finish were almost flawless on delivery.",0
"There is one small flaw in the paint, a bubble on the front fender, less than the size of a pinhead.",0
So far I've found no other flaws in the car.,1
"The minor cosmetic differences in the'02 go a long way in improving the looks of the car, which many consider bland.",0
"These changes include a reshaped headlight cluster, integrated fog lights ( long overdue ), clear reverse light lenses and a larger, toothier grille.",0
"I chose the silver exterior, with dark ebony interior.",0
"The fake wood for this exterior color option is black only, which looks better in my opinion than the tan with brown wood, which is obviously fake.",0
"I know the black wood is also fake, but somehow I think it's better looking than the fake brown wood.",0
Another advantage to the TL is the flat pricing structure.,0
"You get a lot of""bang for the buck"" with the TL.",0
Just compare it to any of the cars I mentioned above and you will find it's extremely well equipped.,0
"Basically the only option for this car is the navigational system, which I could not justify paying $ 2000 for.",1
Some of the key features include:,0
-3.2 liter aluminum alloy 24-valve SOHC V-6,0
"-260 hp ( Type-S), 225hp for the TL",0

-Heated front seats with 8-way power driver seat,0

#NAME?,0
( excellent for parallel parking ),0
"-auto up/down driver's side window, very handy",0
The engine is incredibly smooth and shifts without hesitation.,1
"Despite its power, you can barely feel it running while idling.",0
"The seats are very comfortable and there are two memory settings coded to the keyless entry fob you carry, which is a nice feature.",0
"The car has excellent road manners and I've found it to be a smooth and comfortable ride, despite the sports-tuned suspension.",0
"The rear seats sit a little low, but there are rear air vents and an armrest with two cupholders for passenger comfort.",0
The back seat has more legroom than you would anticipate and is actually quite comfortable.,0
The cabin is quiet and road noise is minimized through lots of soundproofing.,0
"The 6-disc in dash CD player is very convenient and the 7-speaker Bose sound output is quite good, although I would like to be able to crank it a little louder.",0
But keep in mind that I came down from a 12-speaker 240-watt Harmon Kardon system.,0
"There are plenty of handy storage bins, including in the door, behind each seat, and a double console cover, with a deep cover ( for kleenex and CDs ) and shallow cover ( for pens, etc. ) over a single storage compartment in the center console.",0
There is an additional power outlet in the center console.,0
"The cup holders are excellent and hold a variety of sizes, from a Coke Can to the largest fast-food cups.",0
I have not yet found a cup size that won't fit in one of the two cup holders.,0
WARNING!!,0
"If you buy this car, DO NOT use the coin holder in front of the shifter for coins.",1
"I know that is its intended purpose, but I had a coin that somehow slipped up behind the compartment, preventing it from closing, and was about to have to take the entire console out to retrieve.",0
"Only after a couple of hours of cramming wire hangers and fingers up into the slot, was I able to get the loose coins out.",0
"This is a common problem, based on what I've read on the internet, and most dealers will not repair it without charging you labor, since it's not a failure.",1
"So whatever you do, don't put any coins in the coin holder.",0
"There is also a nice cubby hole in front of the shifter for chapstick and keys, etc.",0
The interior is well laid out.,0
The one problem I have with the interior is the foot emergency brake.,0
I would much rather have a hand emergency brake.,0
"If the foot brake released when the car was put into gear, it wouldn't be so bad, but you have to push it, and I've found there is a fine line between fully engaging the brake and pushing it too far, to where it releases without engaging.",1
This can be extremely frustrating until you get a feel for it.,0
"The key fobs have excellent range, and include a power release for the trunk deck.",0
I've had this car since March and will continue to update the review as warranted.,0
May 2001-I just took the car to the dealer for a recall of the power window control unit ( which I have not had any problems with ).,1
They had it replaced in less than 30 minutes.,0
"July 2001-I just rolled over 3,000 miles and changed the engine oil myself.",0
The drain plug and oil filter are the easiest I've ever accessed on any car.,0
"They are both directly over the drain bottle, so its very easy to drain the oil.",0
I was done in less than 10 minutes.,0
The engine layout seems logical and all the necessary reservoirs and tanks are clearly labeled.,0
"January 2002-I just rolled over 10,000 miles and have changed the oil 3 times and rotated the tires once.",0
I've had no mechanical difficulties of any kind.,1
"In fact, I haven't had any problems of any kind.",0
The car is great for road trips.,0
"I completely disagree with the person who wrote the review titled"" Acura TL Type-S: Lost any fillings lately?"".",0
Specifically there are a few things I want to point out.,0
"First, he said the ride is horrible.",0
This is completely untrue.,0
"I have one, drive it every day, and if anything the ride is too soft.",0
Fillings falling out?,0
"Perhaps he is used to riding around in a 1976 Cadillac Sedan DeVille, floating across the pavement with no connection to the road?",1
Perhaps he needs a new dentist.,0
The ride is hardly rough.,0
He also states that it doesn't really do as well as it should for a front driver.,0
"Perhaps he should either drive one, or read what Road and Track said when they did an extensive review of the Type-S.",0
"Namely that it does NOT feel like a front driver at all, despite the fact that it is.",1
Value.,0
"He mentions that it's too bad that there isn't a $ 30K performance sport sedan, and refers to BMW, Maxima and I30.",0
First the BMW.,0
What BMW can you buy that costs $ 31K?,0
None.,1
"With an automatic, and a somewhat modest option list they easily soar past $ 35K.",0
How about a nice 330i?,0
"$ 40K for a car with 35 HP LESS than the Acura, and less torque.",0
"Ok, to save money, drop down from the BMW 3.0 to the smaller engine.",0
Have you driven one?,0
I have ( 328is ).,0
They have NO low-end torque and feel like an economy car compared to the Type-S.,1
Additionally have fun spending a thousand bucks + for snow tires and rims for the BMW.,0
"Sure the handling is superior to the Acura, but for $ 9K I think I'll take a couple of European vacations.",0
"The bottom line, the value the Type-S has is very high, especially compared to the BMW.",0
"Ok, how about the Maxima?",0
Have you driven this car?!,0
I have driven the 2004 SE and it is SOFT.,0
Feels more like an Accord.,0
"Great engine, lots of torque, and very quick, but clearly geared towards lots of highway miles and not back road driving.",1
Bottom line is this car is a HUGE value.,0
"Absolutely amazing engine, and one of the best front driving cars I have ever driven.",0
"Don't just take my word for it, read the magazines and hear what the""professionals"" have to say.",0
/Gene,0
"After a strong start back in the late 80s, Acura threatened to fade into obscurity with the appearance of Lexus and the resurgence of the German luxury brands.",0
Acuras decision to junk real model names in favor of two-letter designations did nt help.,0
"But now theyve found a new formula, and it seems to be working for them.",0
"Like the successful 1999 redesign of the TL, with which it shared a Honda Accord-based chassis, the 2001 CL Type S came standard with everything except a navigation system ( even a Bose sound system with a six-disk in-dash CD changer! ).",0
"Yet it was also priced far less than the European competition at just over $ 30,000.",0
Nothing significant has changed for 2002.,0
The most notable standard feature is a 3.2 liter six the produces 260 horsepower at a high but still accessible 6100 RPM.,0
"This is 35 more than the 225 of the standard CL and of the new 3.0 liter in the roughly $ 10,000 more expensive BMW 330Ci.",0
Only one transmission is available: a five speed automatic.,0
"Perhaps in an attempt to placate those who might wonder where the manual is, this automatic comes even in the regular CL with a sequential sportshift,  which supposedly offers the feel and control of a manual without the bother of a clutch.",1
Update: For 2003 a manual is finally available in the CL-S.,0
"I have driven this car, and posted a review of it under the listing for the 2003 CL-S here: http://www.epinions.com/content_72728153732",0
So the CL Type S poses as a serious yet much less expensive challenger to the BMW 330Ci.,0
Does it really measure up?,0
"To find out, I took one for a drive.",0
Styling,0
The more serious mission of the second-generation CL is evident in its styling.,0
"The first CL was attractive, even pretty.",0
"Its tall, airy greenhouse ( window area ) and artfully tapered rear end gave it a unique appearance ( except from the front, which had a generic Honda look to it ).",0
But the styling of the first CL did not exude substance and luxury.,1
"Its styling connoted playfulness, lightness, and perhaps agility.",0
"Yet, despite some of the flavor of the late BMW 6-series, it didn't have the look of a serious luxury car.",0
Acura has fixed this with the new car.,0
Though roughly the same sizethe largest dimensional change is a two inch increase in lengththe new car appears much larger.,0
This is largely the result of shrinking the greenhouse and bulking up the body.,0
These looks are not entirely deceiving.,1
"Though similar in size, the new car is about 500 lbs.",0
heavier.,0
These changes come with a cost: the new styling is not as distinctive.,1
"What designers refer to as the DLO ( for daylight opening, the side window outline ) is strikingly similar to the last Nissan 240SX, which failed to stand out against other coupes and failed in the marketplace.",0
"Where the old DLO curved up quite a bit towards the rear, the new one curves subtly down.",0
The rear end of the car is no longer strongly tapered.,1
It now looks much like that of many other cars.,0
I personally lament these styling changes.,0
"But I must admit they make grant the new CL a much more substantial, more serious, considerably more luxurious appearance.",0
To hammer this message home the CL Type S rides on 17 wheels with a strong five-spoke design.,0
No multitude of frilly thin spokes or cross-mesh design here.,1
"On the inside the serious performance message is conveyed by perforated leather, metallic gray gauge faces, and, with the ebony interior, black wood. ",0
( The parchment interior comes with the brown wood of the standard CL. ),0
"The last, similar in appearance to that found in high performance Jags and Mercedes, covers large portions of the door panels and center console.",0
"If you want still more of it, the dealer can add a piece around the instruments.",0
"How can Acura afford such extravagance in a $ 30,000 automobile?",0
Easy: unlike that in the European brands this wood  is plastic.,0
"The tan interior come with more traditional-looking wood that is a bit orange for my tastes, but it seems to work for many people.",0
Especially those who dislike the trendier gray variety.,0
Accommodations,0
I actually prefer the interior to that in the BMW in many ways.,0
"Because the cowl is low in the traditional Honda fashion and the cockpit is a couple of inches wider, the CLs interior manages to feel more open than the BMWs while still feeling driver-oriented.",0
"The view forward is especially nice, with the steering wheel well below even a short drivers field of vision.",0
Ive never warmed to the extremely high position of the wheel and instruments in BMWs.,1
"I like to see the instruments, but I mostly want to see OUT.",0
"Though the side windows are much shorter than in the old CL, the beltline is not uncomfortably high, about on par with the BMW.",1
The front seats not only look impressive but are very comfortable and hold you in place very well due to their large bolsters.,1
They are slightly softer than the traditionally hard ( though still comfortable ) seats in the BMW.,0
My only complaint about the driving position is that the steering wheel feels a bit close.,0
"Since another reviewer felt it was too far away, it seems a telescoping wheel is in order.",0
"Though the Acura is over a foot longer and a few hundred pounds heavier than the BMW, and simply feels like a significantly larger car, it is similarly tight in the rear seat.",0
"Though Im only 59, I barely fit in the rear seat behind a similarly sized driver.",0
My hair brushed the rear glass.,0
Apparently the extra length and weight went towards the flowing exterior lines rather than the interior.,0
At least it is easy to get into the rear seats compared to other coupes.,0
"Lift the handle on the side of either seat, and it glides forward.",0
"Tilt the seat back, and it automatically returns to its previous position.",0
The CL does not pretend to seat five: the center of the rear seat is occupied by a storage console.,1
The major problem with the rear seat is that it does not fold downthere is only a pass-through behind the armrest.,1
The BMW does offer this feature.,0
I personally would not want a car without it unless I planned never to use it to carry moderately large objects.,1
"In both of the cars I own the rear seat folds down, and Ive used this feature many times to carry large objects such as book cases and cribs.",0
On the Road,0
The Type Ss throttle is tuned to make the car jump the moment you tip into the throttle.,0
This is both good and bad.,0
It conveys the capabilities of the car.,0
"But it also makes a smooth, subtle launch difficult.",0
Your passengers might think you're having trouble growing up.,0
"Then again, this might be the image you are after.",0
"Give it gas, and the engine immediately responds.",0
"Unlike some high performance engine variants, that in the Type S is not just a high RPM wonder than offers few benefits over the standard CL engine in regular driving.",1
"This engine does nt only make 35 more horsepower on the high end, 500 RPM further up the tach.",0
"It also has a higher, flatter torque curve through the mid-range, so it will feel stronger even in relaxed driving.",0
The torque peak is 16 lbs.-ft.,0
"higher, and is reached 1200 RPM sooner.",0
This paradox is made possible by a sophisticated two-stage manifold not found in the standard CL.,1
"As a further bonus, the Type S engine earned the same EPA numbers as the 225 horsepower one: 19/29.",0
Honda certainly has a way with engines.,0
I should add that the engine also makes nice sounds.,0
"When pushed, it does not attempt to be silent.",1
"Fortunately, the mellow growl at high RPM connotes refined power.",0
"I personally prefer the slightly more throaty, more mechanical, sportier voice of the BMW 3 liter, but this engine sounds more luxurious.",0
Anyone interested in this type of car will rev the engine from time to time just to hear it burble.,0
I really wish a manual transmission were available in this car.,0
That ( and a hand-operating parking brake ) would solidify its claim to be a serious contender among performance coupes.,0
"It would also make the car more fun to drive, at least for me.",0
"The"" sportshift"" was easy to use: just slide the lever into a short slot to the left of"" D,"" and then push forward to upshift and pull backward to downshift.",0
This allows you to quickly and easily control which gear you are in.,0
"But, at least for me, nothing can replace the responsiveness and""at one with the car"" feeling you get from a good clutch and manual shifter.",0
"As I've already mentioned, this wish has now been granted.",0
In my review of the 2003 I describe the happy results.,0
The key challenge faced by Hondas engineers was surely how to manage 260 horsepower through the front wheels.,0
"The key difference between this car and the BMW is that this car, due to its Accord roots, is front-wheel-drive.",0
"Generally, channeling a great deal of power through the front wheels results in torque steer: the car pulls to one side during hard acceleration.",0
"Remarkably for such a powerful front driver, torque steer is all but absent.",0
"Under hard acceleration the steering acquired an additional degree of stiffness ( partly an artifact of the way the variable assist is set up ), but it did not tug to one side or the other.",1
Many other car companies should study this car to figure out how this was done.,0
"On the whole, handling was also impressive for a front-driver, or a rear-driver for that matter.",0
"Though weight distribution is far from even, understeer in hard turns is moderate ( though always present ).",0
"The nicely-tuned suspension, despite tires with only a 215 mm cross-section, sticks very well.",0
"I drove this car hard along a curvy road, yet felt well within the limits of the car.",0
"The front-drive layout, not matter how well it is tuned, simply does not allow the kind of power-on oversteer that can readily be had in the BMW.",1
Otherwise this is a fine chassis.,0
"Not quite as tossable, but very stable and enjoyable enough for most drivers.",0
"The overall feeling is simply of a larger, more luxurious car.",0
I felt more cosseted than connected.,0
"For those who really like to make a car dance, and I am among these, Id still recommend finding the additional cash for the BMW.",0
But most people shopping these cars will find the Acuras chassis more than sufficient for how they typically drive.,0
I do not think most luxury coupe buyers will be troubled by the major fault I had with the car: its steering.,1
"When the car is driven in a relaxed manner, the steering feels pretty good, with a desirable amount of heft ( if not exactly road feel ) once the car exceeds parking lot speeds.",1
"But when the car is driven in a spirited manner, steering feel jumps all over the map, going heavy, then light, then suddenly heavy again, sometimes within the span of a few seconds.",0
"While this poses no safety issues, it detracts from the feel of the road desired from the steering of a drivers car.",0
"Over most surfaces the CL Type-S rides quite well, especially considering the capabilities of its chassis.",0
The only exception I noticed was some jitteriness over slightly imperfect surfaces.,0
Ive noticed this characteristic in some other cars with low-profile tires.,0
I personally feel this is an unnecessary trade-off to make to get that final bit of steering response.,0
"The BMW 3s Ive driven rode better, even with the Sport Package.",0
I suspect the standard CL would not have this problem.,1
"I have not driven the standard CL, so I can only guess at how it compares.",1
"The extra power of the Type S sounds nice, 260 is a big number, but may not make such a large difference in actual driving.",1
"The same goes for the stiffer suspension and larger wheels of the Type S. Are the engine, suspension, and interior trim differences of the Type S worth the extra $ 2,350?",0
I urge potential buyers to drive both CLs and make this judgement for themselves.,0
Last Words,0
"In the end I was impressed by the CL Type S, but not in love with it.",1
Its a matter of personal preference.,0
"If you want a luxurious, fully loaded coupe with a lot of power and above-average handling for about $ 30k, then this is probably your best choice.",0
"It certainly appeals to me more than the Toyota Solara, its closest competitor in terms of features and price, or even some more expensive coupes such as the Volvo C70.",0
"This is a lot of coupe for the money, and it has a number of strengths.",0
"But if you want the most enjoyable coupe to drive, with other factors being secondary, the BMW, even the less powerful 325Ci, remains a better choice due to its superior steering and handling.",0
Especially if your definition of an enjoyable coupe includes a manual transmission and a tossable chassis.,0
The 2002 Acura 3.2CL is an all-around car.,0
It comes with pretty much everything standard.,0
"It's simply an extensive vehicle, that covers all aspects of driving, comfort, and convenience.",0
Exterior,0
"One look at this car, and this section of the review speaks for itself!",0
"The 2002 3.2CL undoubtedly offers a sharp, clean look to it.",0
The curves of this car truly makes one drool upon the sight of it.,0
"All in all, the car is very well modeled, especially with the dual exhaust in the back, allowing for a nice symmetry.",0
"The curvature of this car also facilitates the washing of the car, since curves are much easier to get around than corners.",0
Interior,0
One could not ask for a more well-equipped interior than the one Acura provides you with.,1
"The 3.2CL is nicely equipped with leather seats, which are quite comfortable.",0
"Because the car is coupe, the driver and passenger's seats are designed to be much more comfortable, than say - a sedan.",0
This is definitely evidenced by this vehicle.,0
The driver and passenger's seats are both somewhat deep bucket seats that allow you to sit snugly in the seats without being overly comfortable.,1
"Because I rarely have any reason to sit in the back seat of my own car, my account of the back may not be accurate.",1
"However, I have sat in the back, just not for a trip.",1
"It seems the back could use a little more leg room, but this of course only depends on the seating of the driver and/or passenger.",0
"Regardless, the seats in the back are rather comfortable.",0
I have also been told this by my passengers.,0
"Of course, if you do intend on having more than 1 passenger in your car at a time, you may want to consider the Acura TL - the CL, just with 4 doors, pretty much.",0
Handling,0
The handling on the CL is pretty decent.,0
"It drives very smoothly, but a bit heavily.",0
"If youre the type who speeds excessively around corners and enjoys being thrown into your door or armrest around these turns, you might consider another vehicle, such as the Lexus IS300, Subaru Impreza WRX, and other competing models.",0
"Of course, you do sacrifice certain features when you choose another car.",0
"Regardless, the bucket seats hold you nicely around those curves and turns and the car accelerates very smoothly, if driven regularly.",0
"It does nt exactly have the fastest acceleration of its competing models, but it s pretty decent, provided the cars weight ( 3485 lbs.",1
 with Navigation; without  3470 lbs ).,1
"All in all, the handling of this car is pretty good, unless youre one with a passion for speed and hard cornering.",0
Features,0
"The 3.2CL is equipped with pretty much everything standard, which I feel is a big advantage of owning this car.",0
"Everything from the tape deck to leather seats is in this vehicle, which make it such an enjoyment driving.",0
Navigation/GPS ( optional ),0
The GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is exceptional on this vehicle.,0
"It is a touch-screen navigation system, which makes it much more convenient than some of the current navigation systems that are on the market.",0
"Many require the use of a small knob-like object to select your choice, which can make typing in long addresses a hassle.",0
"With the CL navigation system, it s just point and shoot. ",0
"However, if you do prefer the joystick  style knob, that is available as well.",0
The navigation system is pretty concise.,0
"The female voice who assists you guides you well, and it also guides you to your preferences, which it should do anyway.",0
"In addition, you can select places by their name, and it can sort the places by distance, and so forth.",0
This is an all-around comprehensive system that covers all aspects of navigation and GPS.,0
"The navigation unit/screen also controls the A/C air flow of the car, whether or not you want A/C itself on, and the speed at which the fan is blown.",1
"This feature is perhaps not extremely necessary, but it does add a nice touch to the high-techness  of this car.",1
"Also, if you are not using the navigation or A/C controls at the time, it can display the time for you set in a background of stars.",1
"However, if you are using the navigation, it will summon the time to the bottom right corner in a small box.",0
"This is a con because there are no other points on the car in which it displays time, making the driver, who always races against time, have to make an extra effort to sometimes lean over to the right to check out the time.",1
"This may be a safety hazard, for those seconds trying to find the time should be seconds spent surveying the road ahead.",0
"Basically, navigation is all a personal choice.",0
"Its just up to the buyer whether or not he is willing to shell out approximately $ 2000 for something he or she may never need, depending on amount of travel and sense of direction.",1
"Maybe you could get it to show off, if you are the conceited type: ).",0
"Personally, I enjoy the fact that I have a screen and voice that can assist me in case I ever get lost and whatnot.",0
"Safety wise, the navigation system is nt much of a distraction, unless you are constantly looking at and inputting things into the screen.",0
"Just remember that though you may be tempted to often look down at the screen, the road is always the most important when driving, hence the female voice that assists you.",0
Music,0
The Bose system in the car ( standard ) is pretty decent.,0
"It delivers a adequate bass, though I feel it could use a little more bass  perhaps another woofer.",0
"All in all, however, the sound quality is pretty good, and is suitable for most types of music.",0
A nice feature to its sound system is the 6 disc in-dash CD changer.,0
"This is a very nice and convenient feature for you dont have to go to the trunk to change the CDs, like in many other CD equipped vehicles.",0
"Overall, Bose equips the CL with a pretty nice system, though a pinch of bass could always be added.",0
Additional Features,0
TCS  Traction Control System  This feature keeps your car straight  and not sliding and spinning after those fast sharp curves.,1
"TCS, or others like it, with other cars, should always be considered when purchasing any vehicle.",0
"Its a large safety factor nowadays, and it could save your life one day when youre supposed to be spinning 360s, but you simply fishtail a bit.",0
Automatic Seats  This is a very nice feature.,0
"Because this car is a coupe and it seats 4, it is pretty obvious that the front seats have to move forward in order for the rear passengers to get in the vehicle.",0
This is true in any coupe that seats more than the driver and passenger.,0
"However, most of the time, you have to lift up a lever near the bottom of the seat and manually push it forward.",0
Not the case with the CL.,1
"In the CL, you simply give the lever on the side of the seat a little push, and the seatback will fold down, and the seat will come forward automatically, giving the rear passengers entry.",0
"Then, after the rear passengers are in, you simply push the seatback back, and the seat moves back to its original position.",0
"This function is very nifty, efficient, and saves the energy of those who constantly have multiple passengers.",0
"Sequential SportShift  Many current cars now carry this feature, though each has its own name.",0
"Its for the driver who has no interest in learning how to drive manual transmission, or the one who prefers automatic, but likes the feel of a manual.",1
"I personally have never driven a manual, but people who have say the SportShift is nothing like driving real manual.",1
It seems like its just a cool little useless feature that can give the driver a bit of power when he or she downshifts.,0
"I personally have not really had the chance to take a ride in SportShift mode, but when I do, I will post an update!",1
"Sure, the CL has SportShift, but it lacks the manual transmission, desired by those hardcore  drivers who really like to get the most from a car.",0
"Steering wheel buttons - To keep the driver focused on the road and not the buttons throughout the car, audio buttons that control volume and tracks ( CDs ) or stations ( radio ) are easily accessible by clicking the buttons mounted on the steering wheel that can change audio.",1
"On the right-hand side, there are buttons that control Cruise Control, which are also easy to get to.",0
"Automatic power window  Like many cars nowadays, this car has the Automatic window function, however only on the drivers window.",0
The passenger window is like any old power window though.,0
"HID ( High Intensity Discharge )/Xenon lights  This, I feel, is a very considerate of Acura to include standard.",0
"These lights provide a brighter, whiter light that allows the driver to fully see the road while driving in the dark.",0
"Though you may not know/have known the name of these lights, you know what Im talking about  when youre driving down the road, seeing all these continuous yellow lights, then one, which is nt yellow, all of a sudden catches your eye.",1
"It has a slight blue tint to it, and it really stands out.",0
Thats what Im talking about: ),0
"I consider Acura very considerate to include these because on many luxury cars, it s still an option.",0
"Also, it enhances safety for the driver, his or her passengers, and other drivers on the road.",0
The specifications and conveniences of this car are practically endless.,0
Please visit Acura at www.acura.com,0
and perhaps request a brochure if you wish.,0
"Perhaps through updates, I can add what features and conveniences I find to be worthy of posted.",0
Conclusion,0
"In conclusion, this car is worth its every penny, because it comes very loaded with everything standard.",0
There is nothing really I could nt ask for in this car.,0
"If youre looking for a combination of performance, luxury, and convenience, this is the car for you!",0
"However, if youre looking more into performance, and are willing to shell out a few more thousands, then I would maybe consider Lexuss IS300.",0
Competing Models,0
"If you are interested in this car, I would recommend you also check out its competing models, as I dont really know your tastes and interests in vehicles.",0
"Though I do own this car and love it to death, I still, and always have, envied Lexuss IS300 ( as is evidenced by my constant comparisons/references to it throughout this review ).",0
"Though it looks to be styled towards a younger generation, it still is an awesome car, despite that it may be a bit more since not everything is standard with the IS300, like it is with the CL.",1
"If theres any specific item you would like me to review about the CL, please post a comment or feel free to e-mail me at chineze@tampabay.rr.com!",0
"If you have any questions or comments regarding the review, please e-mail me or post a comment as well!",0
Thanks for your time!,0

|Happy New Year! |,0
Acura 3.2CL 2002,0
The Golden Boy,0
"I remember about 7 or 8 years ago, I received a phone call from one of my client.",0
She was opening a new car dealership and wanted me to set them up with the same service I had put in place at her other store.,0
"I call her accountant, which I already had met several times and made a working lunch appointment with him.",0
"During lunch he told me that they were opening a new Acura dealership, I was a little curious although I had seen a few Acura's but I never did see one close by.",1
"When we finally got to the dealership, they had just taken delivery of a few cars.",0
"After filling the proper documents and training the new cashiers, I returned to the accountant to inform him that every thing was on-line and that his new staff was already trained.",0
He said that he was on his way out to try out his new demo and asked if I wanted to come along.,0
"I really must say that this car was very impressive, I am not quite sure what model it was, but it sure gave a very comfortable ride.",1
I told myself; here we go a few more lean years for Detroit.,0
"But on the way to the market, a funny thing happened.",0
"Acura's early popularity vanished, I never found out why, but it was a rare occasion to see one on the road at least in our area.",1
Recently a friend of mine that lives in South East Asia bought a brand new Gold Acura 3.2CL.,0
"If you think a gold color car will get some attention in America, it is nothing compares to the looks he is getting in Asia with this very flashy, but classy automobile.",0
Automobile description:,0
The new 2002 Acura 3.2CL is available in 2 models for this year.,0
A base model and a supercharged high-performance 3.2CL Type S.,0
"From the exterior both models look the same, they have beautiful sporty lines and it is combined with a very elegant silhouette.",0
"The base model is the one I drove and it was fully loaded, I asked my friend Mike if he had to pay a lot for all the extras or if he bought a package.",0
I was surprised when he told me that all the equipment was standard even on the base model.,0
"Here are some of the standard equipment the 3.2CL is equipped with: air bags for driver, passenger and side, remote keyless entry, power windows, locks and mirrors, cruise control, AM/FM CD player, sunroof and leather seats.",0
This is quite an impressive list of standard equipment for a base model.,0
The interior of the Acura 3.2CL is very particular; it comes with twin sets of bucket seats.,0
"That's right this is not a mistake, you have two bucket seats in the front and to in the rear.",1
"I must admit that I have never seen this in a coupe before, the closest thing I have seen that might resemble this seating arrangements were the seats I had in my 1962 Thunder Bird.",1
Twin Buckets in front and a sofa like seat in the rear that looked like semi buckets seats.,0
"As I mentioned earlier the Acura CL comes fully loaded, since it is not a very big automobile you may think how did the engineers at Acura manage with all those controls and gages.",1
Every controls are easy to reach for the driver and also quite easy to detect.,0
The dashboard is very well designed and you can tell that they have put a lot of attention to the details in this car.,0
"Now nothing is perfect, if there is one flaw it is that it may be a tight fit for a large body person.",0
But aside from that the seats are extremely comfortable and the Bose sound system which comes with an in-dash CD changer is something to listen to.,0
"When looking at the Acura CL from the front, to me it seems as if something is missing.",0
"I can not quite make out what it is yet, maybe it is a lack of chrome, it has some but mostly around the lights and grill.",1
Well anyway aside from that the car looks great.,0
"Not that it will make people turn their heads as one goes by, but it a beautiful coupe.",0
On the road:,0
I must admit that I did not have a chance to drive this car very much.,1
"Only a few shorts drive, within a few miles from our cottage.",0
"But for the times I did drive, it was a great experience.",0
The one thing I did noticed during these short drives is the excellent all around vision the driver has and this includes a very small dead spot from the side view mirrors.,0
"A few times when I drove the car it poured, as it can in Asia.",0
The car ABS breaks worked just fine and it was easy to control the automobile at all time mainly because it is a forward wheel drive.,0
Under the hood:,0
The Acura 3.2CL I drove was equipped as follows:,0
"Engine: A V-6, 3.2 liters that produces 225 Horsepower.",0
Transmission: A 5-speed automatic.,0
Breaks: 4-wheel disc breaks with ABS.,0
Final thought:,0
"First let me say if you want to be noticed, get a Gold car, at least it works in Asia.",0
But aside from this the Acura 3.2CL is an excellent automobile and quite recommendable for anyone looking for a car that has bucket seats in the rear.,0
"The # 1 thing I look for in a car, before horsepower, quality, or anything else, is a chassis that entertains in everyday driving.",0
Over the last decade Ford?s,0
European subsidiary has developed what are arguably the best-handling front-wheel-drive cars in the world.,0
"My current car is a 1996 Contour SE, which was developed by Ford of Europe.",0
"I always look forward to driving this car, even if it?s",0
just a run to the store.,0
"Well, the Contour is gone ( though Mercury may get a version of this car back in the future. )",0
"But the Focus, developed by the same organization, continues to be sold in the U.S. It has been selling much better than the Contour did.",0
Much more adventurous styling has probably made the biggest difference.,0
"But I?ve also read that the Focus handles even better than the Contour, and this can?t hurt.",0
"Drawn by this reputation for excellent handling, I?ve been intending to review the Focus for a couple of years at this point.",0
"I actually test drove one over a year ago, but felt that I didn?t get a thorough enough sense of the car to review it.",0
"I was helping my sister look for a car at the time, so I test drove an automatic.",0
With four adults in the car.,0
And the A/C on.,0
Over hilly roads.,0
Suffice it to say I didn?t think this was a fair test.,0
"After this initial drive, I kept putting off a second test drive due to news that this or that sport package would be available in?a few months,?",0
culminating in early releases about an SVT model.,0
"SVT, a Ford unit that tunes select models for top performance, could be expected to get the most out of the Focus.",0
So I decided to wait.,0
"Initially the SVT Focus was going to be introduced in November 2001, but didn?t actually appear until spring 2002.",0
"When it did, I was there.",0
Styling and Accommodations,0
I won?t even try to describe the Focus?s styling.,0
"It?s so unique, I suspect virtually everyone is familiar with its complex blend of edges, character lines, and curves, and either loves or hates the overall effect.",0
"Actually, I?m a bit on the fence, but inclined toward the?love? camp when the car is fitted with alloy wheels, especially the thick-spoked sixteen-inchers.",0
"The SVT has even larger wheels, but with their thin spokes they are less distinctive.",0
"As for body styles, the round front end works best with the hatchbacks, okay with the sedan, and clashes with the boxy rear of the wagon.",0
The interior styling is nearly as unconventional.,0
"Initially the ZTS model included woodgrain trim, which was very out of place.",0
I hope this had changed.,0
"The SVT, thankfully, includes fairly subdued trim pieces.",0
The basic design is wild enough without?help.?,0
The major problem I had with the interior was the poor fit of the power window buttons and a piece of window trim on the driver?s,0
door.,0
"From what I?ve read, the Focus has had a number of quality problems, and, judging from the car I drove, these seem to be continuing.",0
The best thing about the Focus?s interior are the seats.,0
"In the SVT, these have nice-looking blue cloth down the center? I suspect to hold the driver in place better than leather would?and black leather on the bolsters.",0
"The front seats are very comfortable and supportive, though I personally would not mind even more aggressive bolsters.",1
Rotary adjustments are provided for lumbar and recline on both front seats.,0
"These might be more awkward to use than levers, but they allow you to get the setting exactly where you want it.",0
"Lack, rubber ringed knobs don?t hurt.",0
"The driver?s seat has a single electric adjustment, for the height of the rear of the cushion.",0
This adjusts the tilt of the seat cushion even more than it affects seat height.,0
"My father, along for the test drive, noted the perfectly placed grab handles on the doors.",0
Once the driver starts doing crazy stuff the front passenger is going to appreciate the bracing these handles enable.,0
"I drove a Pontiac Vibe immediately after driving the Focus, and its doors included no such handle, only an indent in the armrest too shallow and too far to the rear to do any good.",1
My father felt this was inexcusable.,0
"Forward visibility is excellent, largely because the seating position is a few inches higher than in the average car.",0
Visbility to the rear is somewhat obstructed by the dipping roof and pinched rear window ( courtesy of those snazzy high-mounted taillights ).,0
A wheel that both tilts and telescopes ( without detents ) combines with the seat adjustments to permit just about anyone to find a perfect driving position.,1
"The Focus, especially in hatchback form, is not a large car.",1
"At 168 inches in length, it?s",0
about 20 inches shorter than they typical family car.,0
The amount of legroom and the general comfort of the rear seat thus come as a great surprise.,0
"Even with 43 inches of front legroom, two more than the typical car, there are 37.6 inches of rear legroom.",0
This is just a couple tenths shy of the much larger Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.,0
"In terms of total legroom, the Focus beats those cars.",0
?Compact??,0
"In terms of shoulder room, yes, but four adults will be happy here.",0
Sometimes rear seat room is cheated by positioning the rear seat low to the floor.,0
Not in the Focus.,1
"The rear seat is high enough to provide good thigh support to average-sized adult men, something that cannot be said about many larger cars.",1
This rear seat room does have a minor price.,0
The optional sunroof ( $ 595 ) is fairly small so that it does n?t,0
reduce headroom for rear seat passengers.,0
"The price isn?t bad, but it?s",0
so small that I?m not sure I?d spring for it.,0
Cargo room is a mixed bag.,0
"Especially with the rear seat folded, cargo space is generous.",0
"That is, unless you need to carry a longish object ( a double stroller in my case ) across the width of the car.",0
"Even without the 8? subwoofer that comes with the $ 675 Audiophile package, but especially with it, the cargo area is narrow.",1
Minimal rear overhang permits this 168?,0
car to have a 103? wheelbase.,0
"This long wheelbase is great for passenger room and chassis stability, but means that the rear wheelwells intrude into the cargo area all the way to the rear of the car.",0
"In the longer sedan the trunk extends past the wheelwells, so more width is available.",0
"Sadly, the SVT comes only as a two-door hatch for now, and while the salesman said a five-door hatch SVT should be available next spring an SVT sedan does n?t seem to be on the boards.",1
"This makes a great deal of sense, as the hatches are by far the sportiest looking Foci, but people who need to carry long objects without folding the rear seat ( i.e.",1
people with young children ) better just forget about the SVT.,0
On the Road,0
The SVT?s most apparent difference is its powertrain.,0
"Although the engine is no larger, variable valve timing is employed to boost horsepower from 130@5300 RPM to 170@7000.",1
"Torque gets a smaller boost, from 135@4500 to 145@5500.",0
These numbers tell much of the engine?s,0
"story: you?re going to have to work it to extract any power, and, with the redline at 7200 RPM, you?re going to have to shift soon after hitting the power peak, dropping you back to about 150 horses.",0
"Power delivery is very linear, with no obvious surges or dips due to alterations in the intake or valve timing.",1
"During my test drive the engine never felt weak, but it never felt all that powerful either.",1
Generally it makes just enough power to be entertaining.,0
"This isn?t necessarily a bad thing: this level of power, just enough to have fun, tends to make a car fun to drive at legal speeds.",0
The engine does make nice noises for a four.,0
"At least you?d better like them, because even when cruising down the street you hear this engine.",0
"It?s not obnoxiously loud, but it?s",1
never silent.,1
At 70 in sixth the engine is turning 3000 RPM.,0
The SVT includes a unique six-speed manual transmission.,0
( An automatic is not available. ),1
Unique among Foci in offering six speeds.,0
Unique in general in that these six speeds are obtained by using two final drive ratios.,0
"I don?t quite understand how this works, but it does.",0
"Even though you?re effectively shifting two gears with many shifts, this shifter was flat-out excellent.",0
"Effort is fairly light, but notchy enough to provide the clear sensation of shifting real gears rather than playing a video game.",0
I cannot recall a better-feeling shifter in a front-wheel-drive car.,1
The clutch is also excellent.,0
"Together, they combined to provide effortless smooth shifts.",0
With many manuals ( even excellent ones like in the 2003 Acura CL-S) I have had to drive the car for a while before I learned how to modulate the clutch and throttle to get seamless shifts.,0
Not here.,1
Now we get to that area of the car I?m personally most interested in: handling.,0
"Even with my high expectations, the Focus SVT surprised me.",0
"The steering is perfectly weighted, quick, and amazingly sharp.",0
I felt directly connected to the road through this wheel.,0
( Perhaps a bit too directly: in the car I drove the wheel vibrated back and forth at highway speeds?hopefully rebalancing the wheels fixes this. ),0
I recall similarly sharp steering only in sports cars such as the Mazda Miata and BMW M Coupe.,0
This steering makes the Focus feel even smaller than it is.,0
A go-kart comes to mind.,0
Sharp steering is only the beginning of the handling equation.,0
For a front-wheel-drive car the Focus SVT has an extremely balanced chassis.,0
Despite the aggressive tuning this chassis feels very stable.,0
Understeer is minimal.,0
A very welcome surprise: torque steer is absent.,0
"I accelerated hard with and without the wheels turned, yet never felt the engine tug the steering wheel.",1
"Despite the tall body, lean in turns is minimal.",0
The 215/45-17 tires grip the road strongly.,0
All of these elements come together to yield a car that is both safe and entertaining to drive aggressively.,0
The SVT has larger brakes than pedestrian Foci.,0
They provide excellent feedback and a great deal of stopping power.,0
"Alas, all is not perfect with this chassis.",1
"The sharp responses and minimal lean come at a price: the ride is awful, perhaps the worst of any car I?ve reviewed.",0
Once again the Miata and M Coupe come to mind as the only real competition.,0
You feel and hear every expansion joint.,0
Larger road imperfections sometimes cause the front suspension to sharply react.,0
"A very solid feeling structure compensates a bit, but not enough.",1
A little rearward compliance would be helpful here.,0
"As it stands, I?m not sure I could deal with the Focus SVT as a daily driver.",1
"The SVT?s chassis has been tuned for those who want the sharpest possible handling, no matter what this costs in terms of ride quality.",1
Be sure to try thoroughly before you buy.,0
"A non-SVT Focus, with higher profile tires and more suspension compliance, will be better suited to the great majority of people.",0
Pricing,0
"A base Focus SVT stickers for $ 17,995 ( all prices with destination charge ).",0
"Even fully loaded like the car I test drove it only runs $ 19,660.",0
"If you?re looking for a high-performance car that can hold four adults, and either don?t care about ride quality or only drive on smooth roads, then this price is a bargain for what you get.",1
"A similarly equipped Sentra Spec-V comes close at $ 18,288 ( with ABS and side airbags?standard on the Focus SVT), but is a more juvenile package that I suspect does not approach the handling finesse of the Ford.",1
"A Civic Si, with less power and 15? wheels?but with a standard sunroof?runs",0
"$19,710.00 ",0
"A GTI 1.8T offers much more mid-range torque and a nicer interior, but soggier, less stable handling, for $ 19,860 ( with 17? wheels ).",0
Those willing to sacrifice a little performance for a better ride can save a couple grand by going with the regular Focus.,0
A?ZX3 power premium?,0
"with optional anti-lock brakes ( $ 400 ) and side airbags ( $ 350 ), stickers for $ 16,020.",0
This model includes a 6-disc CD player as standard equipment ( it?s part of the optional Audiophile package for the SVT).,0
"You can save another grand by doing without power windows/locks/mirrors, keyless entry, and the CD changer, but this does n?t",1
seem like a good trade to me.,0
"Yet another grand can be saved by doing without A/C, cruise, the tile/telescoping wheel, and the 16-inch wheels, but now you?re talking crazy.",1
"Basically, the upgraded engine, suspension, and seats of the SVT package cost $ 2,000.",0
"Not pocket change, but a more than fair price is you?re into the tradeoffs involved.",1
Last Words,0
"The Focus SVT surprised me in many ways, most good, some not so good.",1
"Overall, it offers a unique driving experience, a highly tuned car right out of the box.",0
"As I?d hoped, handling is excellent.",0
"Unfortunately, the price for this handling includes a ride so bad I?m not sure I could personally live with it, at least not on Michigan?roads.? If you want the sharpest handling practical hatch, period, then this is your car.",1
"If you care at all about a smooth ride, you?ll probably be happier elsewhere, either in a regular Focus or a VW.",0
The Imac is horrible.,0
Sure it looks nice but we are talking about a computer not an office ornament.,1
For those who are looking to buy a computer that is technologically advance and will last at least a couple of years before it becomes worthless LOOK ELSEWHERE and don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of junk.,1
"I could write a huge book on why the iMac is a bad computer, but to be brief here are a some of the big problems with the Imac:",0
1 ) Over Heating,0
The IMac has no fan on the processor which means on really hot days your computer could possibly over heat and shut down.,1
Worse comes to worse your processor can get fried making your computer worthless.,0
Also because the iMac compacts everything in that little case there is overheating with all the other hardware parts which could cost you in performance.,0
Also since there is no fan on the processor the processor is running at a slower speed then it technically could which means that there is wasted hardware potential.,1
In a nutshell the Imac heats up a lot faster then normal computers which is bad for your computer.,0
Besides why would you want your computer to be releasing massive amounts of heat on a hot summer day,0
2 ) Hardware sucks,0
Try using the DVD drive it is so flimsy.,0
It is bound to brake.,0
It doesn't even come out all the way when you press the button.,0
There is no floppy disk.,1
The speakers suck.,0
The mouse and keyboard are horrible see my section on Ergonomics.,0
Can't upgrade to anything see can't upgrade.,0
3 ) Lack of Software,0
As with all Apple computers very few developers make software for Macs.,0
Even when they do the software comes out months or years after it has come out for PCs.,0
Go in to a computer store and look at the software sections for both PCs and Macs.,0
You will soon see the difference.,0
Mac holds such a small part of the computer market that there is little profit and incentive for companies to make software for Macs.,0
"If you want lots of software (especially games ), then buy a PC.",0
4 ) Can't Upgrade,0
It is next to impossible to upgrade an imac.,0
Open up the case and look.,0
You be lucky if you can locate anything.,0
Just about every Pc can be upgraded.,0
Plus even if you could there is almost nothing to upgrade to.,0
"While Pcs have tons of hardware upgrades (video cards, sound cars... ) availble, macs have next to none.",1
You are suck with it.,0
5 ) Ergonomics,0
Before you buy try out the new Imac.,0
You will find that the mouse and keyboard are Ergonomicly painful.,0
The mouse and keyboard are too small to fit your hands and will make your hand hurt after a couple of minutes.,0
Never have I used a more uncomfortable mouse or keyboard.,1
6 ) Price/Performance,0
Sure you have all heard that macs are twice as fast a Pcs at least.,0
Too bad the test was done by Byte Mag. a product of apple.,0
Sure in some intences they are a bit faster but most times they lag far back in performance.,0
I have comparing the parts of an iMac with a Compaq Pc in the same price range to prove that the iMac is not worth it.,1
The Pc,0
A) Costs:,0
Pc - $ 1299 ( complete system w/ printer ),0
Imac - $ 1299,0
B) Processor:,0
Pc - Pentium III 600,0
iMac - G3 400 MHz,0
C ) Memory:,0
Pc - 128 mg,0
Imac - 64 mg,0
D) Hard drive:,0
Pc - 17 GB,0
Imac - 10 GB,0
E) Monitor:,0
Pc - 17,0
Mac - 15 in,0
F) Results when software was run on both:,0
Starcraft ( game ):,0
Pc - 5 sec to load,0
Mac - 7 sec to load,0
Microsoft word:,0
Pc - 2 sec to load,0
Mac - 2 sec to load,0
Netscape:,0
Pc - 3 sec,0
Mac - 6 sec,0
Photoshop ( graphics program ),0
Pc - 6 sec,0
Mac - 5 sec,0
"As you can see, the iMac is not worth it the high price or the trouble.",1
I urge you to get a pc.,0
However if you are a Mac lover get a new G4 instead of the Imac.,0
Let me start off this review by first stating that the iMacDV I own is the 1999 model.,0
"When I bought the computer, I was awestruck taking it out of the box.",0
It was sooo cute!,0
"It was also incredibly easy to set up, I was on my way after plugging in only a couple of cords.",0
"However, after having the mac for a short while I began to notice its downfalls.",0
1 ) Can you say no space?,0
"I was a film major in college, and I loved the idea of being able to edit my school projects on my computer.",0
Until I realized only about 10 minutes of footage would fit on my hard drive before the computer would freeze.,0
I had no idea of the compatibility issues that existed when I bought my computer.,1
Final Cut Pro wont even run on it for lack of space.,0
"2 ) My modem""went bad""",0
"I have now owned my mac for two years, and one day when trying to sign on to AOL, it decided I no longer had a modem.",1
"I tried reloading AOL, checking the system extensions, and just about everything else that I could possibly think of before I called the local Mac repair shop.",0
"Two days letter I got the following message on my answering machine:"" Turns out your modem has gone bad.",0
"If you want us to replace the faulty modem, the modem cost is $ 120 and the price for labor is $ 75"" OUTRAGEOUS!",0
"I have decided to not get my computer fixed, and to save up until I have the ability to buy a G4.",1
"UPDATE Turns out it was not my modem that was the problem, I have a faulty logic board.",1
"This is quite a bit worse of a problem, as there is no way to fix it, without paying more than my computer is worth.",1
ARGH.,0
I will never sign on to the internet again with my iMac.,1
"It kind of makes me wonder why the""i"" in iMac stands for""internet""",0
3)fast processor?,0
A pox on whomever believes the hype about how much faster Mac processers are than PCs.,0
"I can't speak for other Macs, but my PC was much faster than my Mac, and it had a couple more years on it.",0
4)DV Drive Problems,0
"I don't know how many of you have taken a gander at the Mac home page, but at the bottom in very small print is the notice for a civil suit against Mac, requiring them to give upgrades to all of their G3s and iMacs built prior to 2000.",0
"If I hadn't thought of buying a much higher model, and scrolled down on their home page, I never would have known, nor would I ever have been able to get the upgrade, as the time limit for upgrading expires on Nov 12th, 2001.",1
( 10 days after I saw the notice ),0
5)User friendly?,0
"I don't know if its because I've played with PCs all my life, but the iMac was anything but user friendly when it came to anything other than standard operations.",0
"I've had difficulty with so many different applications, its impossible to list them all.",0
AND the iMac doesn't come with a support booklet.,0
"If you are having problems with an application, you have to use a less-than-reliable computer searching HELP device.",0
"It also doesn't help that they have online support when your computer's modem has""gone bad""",0
"I was so excited when I was given an iMac for my birthday last year, especially since it is aqua blue.",0
"However, I have found lots of flaws with this computer.",0
"First of all, it doesn't have a disk drive ( the hard square disks ), you have to buy that seperately ( which runs about 100$! ).",1
I couldn't transfer any files from my old computer onto my new iMac without buying extra stuff!,1
"I was also not happy with the DVD player, it isn't fast enough to keep up with the DVD itself!",1
The actors lines will go in and out of being dubbed correctly.,0
"It is only a slight problem, but it really aggravates me to the point that I have only watched one DVE on it.",0
"Not only that, this computer has frequent crashes ( about once every week or so ).",1
"That is a problem in itself, but to make matters worse there is no set of keys that you can press to restart the computer.",1
You have to hold down the power button for about ten seconds for the computer to turn off.,0
A few times even that hasn't worked and I actually had to unplug my computer.,0
"However, the computer does have a lot of memory, it is pretty quick, and is good if you don't constantly have to import and export things from your computer.",1
"The tech support is very helpful too...however, I have WAY too many friends there considering this is supposed to be a very reliable computer.",0
"Overall, I wouldn't suggest this computer, espcially since the world is being run more and more by PC's now ( I cannot down load files unless they are in a MAC format...very frustrating ).",1
"I was going to purchase one of the new $ 1199 mid-range iMacs for my 19 month old son to bang on, I wanted it primarily as a DVD equipped monitor so that he could watch"" Baby Shakespear"" DVDs in the nursery.",0
But Apple decided to replace the DVD player with a cd Burner.,0
"Yeah, like my son is going to rip and burn his own cd's!",0
He has mastered banging on the keyboard and wiggling the mouse with Toddler Disney!,0
But downloading Mp3s and burning will have to wait at least until he is three!,0
The Digital Video feature is virtually useless with the 20GB hard drive.,0
"If there were absolutely no system files on the drive, that would allow for approximately one hour of captured digital video.",1
"I guess you can convert the file into an Mpeg1 on a 650MB CD-R, and make VCDs.",0
"But I can do that on a $ 550 PIII much easier and faster, even with analog video if I don't want to pay $ 1000 for a digital camcorder.",1
I'll have to purchase a used iMac with a DVD player.,0
"Or I can do what Apple want's me to do, get the $ 3,499 G4 with a Superdrive to play DVD's.",0
"I might as well get the $ 2,999 Cinema display while I'm at it!",0
"Gee, I wonder if I can plug in my old 1985 Apple IIc"" Superdrive"", ah, but it dosn't support DVD either!",1
"I purchased this product because I like"" thinking different.""",0
I was really sick of Windoze! I was originally going to get an iBook but the features in the iBook pale in comparison to the iMac.,0
"So I went to CompUSA and bought a blueberry one, BIG MISTAKE.",0
I got the computer home and I thought it was great until I saw two little black dots towards the bottom of the screen.,0
"I have only heard of dead pixels on LCD displays, the kind they use on laptops, like the Powerbook series.",0
So I took it back the next day and they gave me a new one.,0
The next day I tested out the new one and this one was fine until I tested a DVD movie on it.,0
The window of where the DVD was playing had big lines going through it horizontally about the size of scroll bars.,0
So I took that one back and then CompUSA said I would have to get another one or wait 15 days to get a refund in the mail.,0
"I opted for a refund because I don't believe in the"" three strikes you're out,"" philosophy, two I think is plenty.",1
"Thus, here I am now, waiting for my check to come in the mail.",0
"I highly suggest you do not buy this computer, instead buy some other Apple computer such as a PowerMac, Powerbook G3, or iBook because Apple is definitely just sending these things out in quantity and not testing them for quality.",1
"My father works in the Marketing and Advertising business, and bought one of these monsters.",0
"He uses it during the day, and I use it during the night.",0
"After a year of working with this thing, I have come to a conclusion.",0
Stop buying Apples.,0
"First of all, my dad bought this thing EXACTLY 4 days before the dual processor macs come onto the market at the same price.",0
I called up Apple and demanded they take it back and give us the higher end model.,0
They politely said they could not do a thing about it and hung up.,1
Poor poor customer service.,0
"Had Apple given a damn about the small market of consumers they have, I would've been transferred to someone with authority, and a solution would have been reached.",0
But no.,1
The system we had was obselete the moment we got it up and running.,0
"If that wasn't bad enough, the computer sucks too.",1
Apple has this problem with making good computer components I find.,0
From the lack of ADB ports to the weeks of buying and returning external SCSI cards because they were incompatible and/or problematic ( these weren't your no-name's either.,1
"LaCie, Adaptec, and Iomega were just a few of the brand names we tried ) with the computer.",0
Some of the devices still don't work with it.,1
"The CD-ROM is very buggy as CDs randomly unmount, and you can't eject them unless you restart your computer ( a very frequent problem on our end ).",1
Perhaps one of my biggest complaints is the lack of performance.,1
All that bull about this being a supercomputer...forget it.,0
"I ran a test between a G3 400 and the G4 500 in photoshop, and the G4 was only about 5 % faster.",0
This is because programs must be designed specifically to run faster on the G4 system before you can get any noticeable speed improvements.,0
"Of course the computer is bundled with OS 9, the most bug filled of all the Mac OS versions ( even with 9.0.4).",0
"While this review isn't about the OS, I must say that protected memory would have made this OS bearable, but when one program crashes, they all go, mon ami.",1
"OS X will be out mid summer ( provided they don't delay it for another year ), and OS X compatible programs will probably be popular around 2002.",1
"In other words, this computer isn't worth your time or money.",1
"Even if you're a graphic designer ( or a hardcore gamer ), avoid G4s alltogether.",0
A G3 400 should satisfy just about anyone who MUST have an Apple.,0
"I have worked with Apples since the Macintosh Plus (around 1986 ), but I have to put my foot down here.",0
Apple is no longer the wonderful system that does exactly what it's told.,1
"Combined with the substandard hardware ( with nifty cases ) and an obselete OS, it runs like Windows 95, but without the multi-tasking and protected memory.",1
"Oh, one more thing.",0
"If you want tech support, Apple has a unique way of helping you - a way not unlike a Dilbert comic I once read: The more problems your computer has, the more you have to pay them.",1
"Apple uses a""pay per incident"" program, meaning if their product F***s up, you get to pay them MORE money so they can tell you to go have it fixed.",0
Thanks Apple.,0
"Wow, this is one beautiful piece of machinery, both inside and out.",0
"It will empty all doubts that Apple is back, but it will also empty your wallet.",0
"I am perhaps one of the worlds biggest fans in emptying my wallet, but it must be a warranted spending, and unfortunately, this is exactly not that.",1
"This computer will do everything you want and more, fully upgraded you could edit an entire feature film on this thing, but for half the price, you could do it on a PC.",0
I am both a PC and a Mac user for different things.,0
"Audio editing, Graphic editing and composing are ten fold better on a Macintosh than on a PC due to better software being manufactured for it.",0
"However, you can get a similar PC for under 3000 dollars and upgrade to far beyond the capacity of this computer for under 5000 dollars altogether.",0
"You can definitely do everything on this computer, but why do it if you can put up with Windows 98 and do evertything and more for virtually half the price.",0
"Video editing, mostly done on Macs professionally is quickly moving over to PC because all upgrades are much cheaper.",0
"It's really terrific that you get 256mb of RAM and a 40GB hard drive with this here computer, but that's just not enough to really edit medium to large amounts of digital video.",1
You can upgrade on this or a PC.,0
But you can do it for half the price on a PC due to the many other manufacturers making PC products that take the price down as opposed to Apple which has a monopoly on it's own parts.,0
Don't buy this computer unless you have money to throw away.,0
"It seems like an industry standard, it's just an industry suggestion.",0
"Please bear in mind, they have money to throw away.",0
If you are looking to edit digital video on your computer email me at ( InnerYouthFilms@aol.com ) and I'm more than happy to provide you with answers that will save you 3000 dollars.,0
"Go PC or go MAC, just don't buy this computer.",1
"Although I do not personaly own one of these monsters, I work with one every day.",1
"You see I am a non-linear video editor, and we have a new G4 Professional paper weight here in our art department.",0
"Sure it is nice in theory 520 MB of ram expandable to 1.5 GB, Built in DVD burner, built in Zip Drive, Airport, USB, Pretty Blue and Clear Case.",0
But that is where the fun ends Im afraid.,0
"First of all Mac-OS 9 which came with ours is a nightmare see my other opinion titled"" OS-?"" for an explanation on that.",0
The New macintosh is exactly that a 500 MHZ paper weight.,0
The art director is disgusted with it.,0
"Always Crashing, Locking up, Finder dissapearing, DVD Drive dosn't burn right.",0
This computer look nice on the outside but if you want a real laugh hold the DVD Flip Door Open and look at the covered up headphone output and volume wheel on the internal DVD.,0
This was not exactly retooled.,1
"Oh yes apple keep cutting thoses corners, your accountants are doing an excellent job.",0
Make sure that their year end bonuses are big.,0
This is one fast machine when it is up and running I'll give it that.,0
But it seems to be faster at crashing as well.,0
"My overall opinion is that this machine has great potential, however it is almost unusable out of the box.",0
Another case of If you do not look under the hood.,1
You deserve what you invested in.,0
I will not make this another long winded review.,1
Look at my review of the Dimension 4550.,0
Any Dell will fit into the same criteria.,0
If you are happy investing in a car that has a nice paint job and a 2.4 GHz sticker glued to the side of it.,0
Great.,0
I charge $ 75-$ 100 dollars per hour repairing proprietary computers like this.,0
And we make great money.,0
"Out of all proprietary manufacturers, I believe Dell is Number One.",0
You will save money.,0
"And it will allow recuperation of your finances, so you can afford the repair and maintenance costs.",0
If you Look under the Hood here is what you see:,0
Case with 250 Watt power supply.,0
"Do not count on the power supply not burning up, when adding more devices.",1
Non-proprietary systems mostly have 300 Watts minimum.,0
"and most non-proprietary mid tower cases will have room for 4 - 5.25"" bays and 6-3.25"" bays.",0
No concrete Motherboard Specs.,1
Video chipset is poor quality.,0
Low end SiS chipset.,0
Board has poor architecture.,0
Motherboard only has 2 memory slots and only supports 1.5 Ghz RDRam max.,0
RDRam runs at high temp and is subject to failure.,0
Bios is Locked down and manual tweaking is virtually impossible( i.e.,0
bios flash ).,0
"Inexpensive higher quality motherboards support up to 3GB of DDR, have higher quality video chipset( i.e.",0
"Nvidia ),and do not contain a locked bios.",1
CPU is an OEM version.,0
"Not a boxed version, which holds a 3 year warranty directly from Intel.",1
"If it fails, the vendor / Distributor has 30 days from date of order for a return.",0
Investor has to pay for shipping and return his case to Dell.,0
If Dell will honor the warranty.,0
"After the 30 day return policy, an investor may as well roll the dice, hoping for a 7 or 11.",0
"Dell memory is cheapest, lowest quality on the market.",0
It will only function correctly in a Dell machine.,0
For the price 512MB should be standard as most non-proprietary custom computers are quoted.,0
RDRam memory operates at high temperatures.,0
Dell makes their money back when you return for more memory.,0
"DDR is less expensive, less inclined to fail, from quality manufacturers( i.e.",0
Kingston ),0
Hard drives have lots of storage space.,0
What is the R.P.M. speed?,0
Hard drive does not have an 8MB cache.,1
On board HDD cache would be great to increase HDD performance of multi-tasking and web performance.,0
Dimension 8250 does not have it for current price quote.,1
"Currently HDD is poor quality, fails easily, may only be 5400 RPM.",0
One of the lowest speeds on the market.,0
CD-Rom is a 48X.,0
Does Dell not have any 56X?,1
There are most likely several million poor quality CD-Roms still on a shelf.,0
DVD-Roms are currently 16X DVD and 56X CD-Rom.,0
Invest in a DVD as they are usually $ 20-$ 30 more for quality brands( i.e.,0
"AOpen, MSI).",0
"Most Leading Technology companies, which Dell claims to be, are phasing out CD-Roms.",0
Dell will still be including CD-Roms in their builds for months to come as they have with 24X CD-Roms on most of their server builds.,0
Open your case and look at the manufacture date on your optical device.,0
I have witnessed several up to 2 years older than the purchase date.,0
Operating System and included software are resource hogs.,0
Operating system is a Dell imaged disk that can only be used on a Dell machine.,0
and nothing other than a proprietary Dell machine.,0
XP home is garbage.,0
Not stable and nearly impossible to network.,1
"Not suited for a small business environment, especially for networking other computers.",1
"Windows 9X, Millenium, and XP home are designed from the same poor architecture.",0
Invest in your Operating System.,0
One of the most important items in your build.,0
"Without Dell, Gateway, HP/Compaq, or other proprietary imaging involved.",1
Full professional version ( i.e.,0
"2000 pro, XP pro ).",0
Dell also includes 4GB-10GB of SPAM software pre-installed.,0
Some of which can not be un-installed except by reload( i.e.,1
"AOL, Bonzi-buddy, etc. )",0
Monitors and accessories can be found for reasonable prices from quality manufacturers.,0
Dell still achieves their mark-up.,0
"sacrificing quality with antiquity and bulk, low-grade, cheap parts.",0
"Dell support in One word, Sucks.",0
Call the support line and see how long it takes for a human voice to answer.,0
Go to a local custom computer store.,0
Add a little to your investment for local support.,0
Much friendlier and more knowledge.,0
"Look and shop around, you may find someone local who is a true technology leader.",0
And your computer will less likely fail within 6 months.,0
You will not wonder why Dell said that XP Home is great for small businesses.,1
"Plus, you will not have to wait for weeks / months for the return of a failed computer.",1
Local builds usually have repair turn-around of 3-5 business days.,0
And they pick up the phone usually by the third ring.,0
"This computer came with a Pentium 4 3.0Ghz, 1Gig of PC 1600 RAM, A 120Gig 7200 Hard Drive, quiet keyboard and Altec Lansing5.1 surround sound speakers.It also came with a 16x DVD-RW and CD-RW drive.",0
When I placed the order for this computer I also added on the Dell Movie Studio Plus with FireWire and S-Video in and outputs.,0
This video card was the ATI Radeon 120MB DDR Video Card and promised to do wonderful things with my home movie collection.,0
I also upgraded the audio card to the Audiogy 2 SoundBlaster live 5.1.,0
"Once I placed the order and after the order was processed and on its way to me, I received a call from Dell saying that the upgraded video and audio cards were not available at the time of the order taking and that Dell has shipped them seperatly.",1
They told me not to worry because it was easy to install them once I received the computer.,1
"I found this a little bizarre but I graciously complied, anxious to receive my mega machine.",0
Actually I have installed extra memory cards and hard drives in the past so I doubted that this would be any different.,0
I ordered my computer on Dec 20 2002 and did not receive it until Jan 15 2003.,1
I'm glad I paid the extra 100 bucks for the 2 day shipping guarantee.,0
When I received my computer I proceeded to install the upgraded video and audio cards which as promised arrived seperately a few days later.,0
I installed both cards correctly with the help of a Dell technician on the phone.,0
From this point on I have had nothing but problems.,0
The computer never recognized either cards.,1
I was on the phone day in and day out for 2 weeks trying to get tech support to help me figure out what was wrong.,0
I was bounced around like a power spike from department to department hoping each time I would hear the voice of God telling me what the problem was.,0
But sadly that day never came.,1
"I was confronted with short tempered tech support people, an ignorant and uncaring sales tribe and the most confused and disorderly customer service this side of a liquidation sale at Kmart.",0
"After several calls, arguments and upset stomachs Dell finally agreed to send out a technician and was nice enough not to charge me the 95 bucks an hour fee for it.",1
The technician replaced the mother board.,0
That didn't work.,0
"He came back the following week and changed both the audio and video cards, guess what, that didn't work.",0
"After I begged and pleaded for them to take back the computer, which they never did they finally sent me a second replacement computer last week.",1
"When I called customer service to find out why they sent me another computer, they were not aware of the situation.",1
"To add insult to injury, when I checked the packing list for this item it was missing both the audio and video cards!! Who the hell is running Dell I ask you?",0
So here I sit in my home office with two brand new four thousand dollar plus Dell desktops which dont work whatsoever.,0
I really wanted to do my video and audio editing on this computer and I had heard that Dell had a good product and even better tech support.,0
I was so wrong.,0
But don't feel to bad for me because when I purchased the computer I chose the pay next year deal which means that I have not paid for this item yet and never will since I cancelled my credit card.,1
Somebody better come and pick these two Dells up soon and give me one what works before I put them both on Ebay and buy a Mac G4,0
I bought the ZD7000 as a desktop replacement for work and home use.,0
The screen is enormous and the notebook worked well for the first 2 weeks.,0
"I am writing this review on my 7 yr old Dell, however, because the new HP only displays the following message:"" Operating System Not Found"".",0
"No problem, I thought.",1
Just a minor glitch - I'll call for 24-7 tech support.,0
I also paid an extra $ 350 for 3 years of HP care with Fed Ex pick up and delivery.,0
I called right away ( on a Saturday ) and HP gave me these options: 1 ) Call back Monday for tech support( Big Surprise ) 2 ) Join a research group for failed hard drives ( I felt like a cancer patient hoping to get into a clinical trial. ),0
3 ) Troubleshoot then and there over the phone - with the understanding that this option would void the previous options.,0
( What??!! ) I was also told they might POSSIBLY exchange it.,0
"I bought the extra warranty for accident coverage, and NOT to be the final step in HP's Quality Control Dept.",1
I will be returning this machine for a full refund.,0
What a disappointment.,0

The MiniTower Case is relatively user friendly if you do not want to add a lot to your new PC.,1
"It provides ( 2 ) 5.25"" drive bays in the front, and the integrated floppy opening.",0
"There are ( 2 ) Internal 3.5"" bays, one of which is used by the Hitachi Hard drive.",0
This permits installation of another Hard Drive if you wish.,0
"The floppy drive does NOT come standard, but you may add one to your system for Twenty dollars, as my family and I did.",1
"I personally feel this is misleading, since almost every PC comes with a floppy drive, and it appears to be one way Dell is trying to keep the cost of their advertised systems under the competition's.",0
"There are ( 2 ) USB 2.0 Ports in front for easy access, plus six more in the back, providing plenty of room for USB accessories.",0
There is a headphone jack in the front for easy access as well.,0
"There is ( 1 ) external 9 pin serial port, and ( 1 ) 25 pin Printer port which supports ECP, EPP, and Bi-directional communication.",0
"There is a PS/2 connector for a keyboard, and one for a mouse.",0
A standard PS2 keyboard and Roller Ball mouse comes standard with all Dell PCs.,0
"If you add a wireless combo, they do not send these.",1
"For this reason, I suggest you order any different keyboard and / or mouse separately since there is no price break in""upgrading"" at the time of purchase.",1
You can always keep the standard units as backups.,0
"The power supply is 250 Watts which may be a bit underpowered if you want to add a lot of accessories, but considering the limited expansion slots, this will likely never be an issue.",1
"The motherboard appears to be an Intel Motherboard, consistent with most Dell configurations.",0
"These are jumperless boards, and operate well, but Gamers may not appreciate the lack of overclocking ability.",1
Since September there have been ( 2 ) BIOS updates to resolve hardware issues with the Network Adapter and allow for the use of faster CPUs..,0
"There are 4 available expansion slots in the back, one of which was utilized by the PCI WinModem, and one by my AGP display adapter upgrade.",0
This leaves ( 2 ) PCI slots for accessories.,0
The integrated NIC is an Intel( R ) PRO/100 VE Network Connection and seems to work well I suggest downloading the driver from Intel instead of using the Microsoft driver.,0
"This provides additional flexibility and options for configuring your network card, and permits'power users' to extract additional network performance.",0
I do not use the 56K Conextant WinModem since I have Cable Access for the internet.,1
I may remove this PCI card should I desire the PCI slot at some time in the future.,0
"The Integrated Audio option I chose ended up being"" SoundMax Integrated Digital Audio"" and is perfectly satisfactory to me.",0
One can always upgrade through an available PCI slot should they wish if it does not meet their needs.,1
"There are connectors for Line IN, Line Out, Microphone, surround and center/low-frequency effects ( LFE ) channel.",0
Inside there are two 7-pin serial-ATA connectors on the motherboard.,0
Serial ATA hard drives provide faster performance that Enhanced IDE drives.,0
This is a nice option to have available.,0
"The motherboard was available with 400, 533, or 800 MHz front side bus, which improves performance with each higher step.",0
"Because my budget was not unlimited, I settled for the 533 FSB, and performance seems adequate.",1
The processor can be upgraded through 3 Gigahertz should I find that performance ever seems lacking.,0
"With future BIOS upgrades, it is possible that this speed will be increased.",0
"There are ( 4 ) Memory slots for DDR memory, two of which are filled with 256 Meg memory modules.",0
Memory can be upgraded to a whopping 4 GIGS or RAM!,0
This should satisfy the most memory hungry users and / or applications at this time.,0
The memory supported is up to 400 MHz Non-ECC DDR SDRAM.,0
"The Intel Chipset used is the 865PE, and I am satisfied with its performance.",0
"It does not appear to be as buggy as some previous Intel Chipsets, but is also not noted for extreme performance and overclocking capabilities.",1
"None of this concerns me, personally.",1
"The AGP slot supports 1x, 2x, 4x, and 8x AGP.",0
I chose the 128MB DDR NVidia GeForce FX 5200 graphics card and am quite happy with the performance.,0
"I probably could have gotten the same card for less money elsewhere if I wanted to shop around, but did not find the upgrade prohibitive in cost.",1
"The Dell Wireless Keyboard / Mouse combination is manufactured by HI-TEK CORPORATION, a company that manufactures OEM products for Manufacturers, and is not particularly noted for high quality products.",1
"It is USB only, even though the web site listed a PS/2 adapter with it.",0
"When connected to the USB port it detected well, but no matter where I placed the receiver it did not communicate with the keyboard and mouse well.",1
"I finally decided to return it, but this is another story, found below.",0
The DVD-ROM could have been either a Lite-On or a Samsung.,0
I ended up with the Samsung.,0
It reads CDs as well as DVDs.,0
"Performance is acceptable, since I installed my own 52 X 24 X 52 CD-RW for my primary CD-ROM.",0
The hard disk is a Hitachi.,0
"They may not be the best on the market, but they are better than many, such as Fujitsu.",1
"Performance seems adequate, although certainly not as good as the Western Digital drives with 8 Meg Buffers.",1
"Since I have a new 180 Gig Western Digital, I will likely replace the Hitachi 80 Gig drive with the western Digital, and use the Hitachi as a backup for important data, only connecting it when I wish to update my backup.",0
"At first, I found the computer to be very slow, and I was greatly disappointed.",0
My old Pentium III 550 seemed much faster.,0
"Once I checked to see what programs were running, I realized that this was caused by numerous Dell software running and wasting memory and CPU cycles.",0
"I spent a week trying to remove and disable these utilities, and the end result was a much faster computer.",0
"There are still some problems where the system appears to lock up, and I am preparing to save all of my data and reload the operating system and the programs I want.",0
"I would encourage new buyers to do this themselves, before putting any data onto the drive.",0
I will discuss the method to do so further down this review.,0
Software:,0
"Dell installs many"" system utilities"" which degrade system performance and waste hard disk space.",0
"The typical end user will not have the technical expertise to disable all of the unnecessary services, disable or remove all of the Dell Spyware and Dell related Software that deteriorates System performance significantly, and the Shareware that become non-functional after 30 days from the date of first use.",1
"Because of this, I highly recommend removing hard drive partitions ( erasing all software ) and then re-installing the software from the provided CD-ROMs.",0
"I do NOT suggest using the Dell"" Restore CD"" which will reinstall all of the aforementioned software.",1
"Dell provides a System Restore CD which removes the drive partition and re-images the drive with a standard Dell setup / configuration, much as the Symantec software Ghost can do.",0
This reloads all of the Dell Spyware and utilities that slow the computer down.,0
"Dell also includes the Operating System CD, in my case, Windows XP home.",0
You may setup your system from scratch by placing this CD in the CD-ROM drive and restarting your system.,0
"This allows one to setup XP, and you should remove the drive partition( s ) before proceeding with setup.",0
Here is a link to a page from Microsoft detailing the process: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;315341,0
"View"" Method 2"" and select"" Install Now.""",0
"When you complete the installation, be certain to install all Updates and patches by visiting http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com",0
NOTE!,0
This is not for the faint of heart or non-technically inclined!,1
"While I find this very simple, I have been working with computers since 1976.",0
"You may be better off having a knowledgeable friend perform the installation, or paying a local shop to do so.",0
"If you choose to do so yourself, be aware that you may render your computer inoperative if you do not perform this properly.",1
"I suggest that if you are in doubt, you seek assistance.",0
"After completing your operating system reinstallation, you will want to install the drivers and programs that came with the computer.",0
Do not install anything you will not be using.,1
You can always choose to install it at a later date.,0
"Loading fewer programs will give you more available disk space, and can improve system performance.",0
There is a driver disk for the Modem drivers.,0
"When the Operating System prompts you for the modem drivers, put this CD in the CD-Rom drive to load the drivers.",0
I do NOT suggest loading the Dell Diagnostics and utilities.,1
"Many of these run in your system tray, wasting your CPU cycles and memory.",0
"In short, they are bad for the system performance.",0
WordPerfect came with the PC.,0
"I own MS Office XP, so I would choose not to install this software.",1
"If you do not own an alternative, you will want to install this.",1
"The Dell Provided Antivirus software(you have to pay for it after 30 days! ), support software, multimedia software, and internet software are all on one CD.",0
I suggest NOT loading this.,1
"Instead, download this Free, and highly effective Antivirus software from Grisoft: http://www.grisoft.com/us/us_dwnl_free.php",0
"Virus definitions are updated regularly, and it has protected my family for years.",0
I highly recommend this.,0
"RealPlayer was on the CD, but you may download a version that does not send your data to Dell by going to http://www.real.com",1
and downloading the free RealOne player.,0
"MusicMatch software is also included, but if you want that, you may download it by visiting that website at http://www.musicmatch.com",0
You may read the details concerning registration before you decide it is right for you.,0
"Other programs that are Try and Buy  are also available from their respective web sites without Dell's injected spyware, or you can find exactly what you want, either in Freeware, Shareware, or Commercial software.",1
Microsoft Encarta 2004 and Microsoft Money 2004 were included.,0
"If you want to use these, load them.",0
"If you do not, don't.",1
"Again, you can load them later.",0
Following these suggestions will provide you with a computer that runs the way it was meant to.,0
"It will be faster, and more stable that the way it was shipped to you.",0
System Setup:,0
"Besides the problems listed under Software, above, all three of our systems had a Thirty Seven Megabyte FAT partition installed in addition to the Windows XP NTFS Partition.",0
Perhaps this is installed to allow for System Hibernation with Power Savings.,0
"I recommend deleting this partition and using One ( or two, depending on your technical abilities and preferences ) partitions formatted with NTFS.",0
I do not recommend the use of System Hibernation.,1
"Turning your computer off is more energy effective, and you do not have any problems that might be associated with system Hibernation.",1
Customer Service:,0
This is the major Problem with Purchasing from Dell.,0
"It is truly unfortunate that Dell Inc. has permitted their"" Customer Care"" to degrade as far as it has.",0
"The Dell Customer Care forums reflect the deterioration of their support, and are filled with customer accounts of Dell Staff not responding, delaying resolution, or providing inadequate resolution to customer problems.",1
"In my family, there were problems with two of the three orders we made at the same time.",0
"My wife completed the rebate form for both her computer and her Mom's computer, and mailed them at the same time at the same post office.",0
System Order # 1.) - My Mother-in-law:,0
"My Mother-in Law's order was fine, and she has not needed to contact Dell for assistance.",1
She received her rebate check after a month.,0
System Order # 2.),0
My Wife:,0
My Wife ordered the EXACT same thing as my mother in law.,0
"The order was fine, but she STILL has not gotten her rebate, and when she checked the Rebate Status page, there is nothing even shown about her rebate.",1
She is attempting to resolve this matter at this time.,0
System Order # 3.),0
My Order:,0
1 ) I ordered a system and upgraded the standard keyboard and mouse to the Dell Wireless Combo for $ 65.00.,0
"The description for this product showed a PS/2 Adapter, which I need to use my KVM ( Keyboard / Mouse / Video switch. )",0
"2 ) When I opened the box, there was no adapter, and no reference to an adapter in the documents.",1
3 ) I contacted Dell Technical support who immediately advised me that this unit is not compatible with PS/2 and cannot be adapted.,1
They told me to contact customer care to send it back for a refund.,0
"4 ) On October 9, I contacted Dell Customer Care to arrange to send back the Wireless Combo for a refund.",0
They agreed to send me a call tag for the unit and promised that they would issue full credit when they received it.,0
"I provided the correct shipping address to my home, since the system was sent to my Mother-in-Law's house in a different state.",0
5 ) I had to call Dell Customer Care back and request the Standard Keyboard and Mouse that I was entitled to with my system purchase.,0
"Customer care had not offered to send it to me, and after explaining the matter, Keeve DTC39418 told me he would have them shipped to me.",1
"6 ) The Dell Customer Care site showed that Order # 497367046 for"" Keyboard,104,6P, United States, Multi-Media,NMB"" shipped on October 10, but to the wrong address.",0
"When I contacted Dell Customer care, they said they could not change the address since it was already shipped.",1
"7 ) On October 12, I got a call from my mother-in -Law telling me she had refused delivery of a Fed-Ex Package from Dell addressed to me.",0
"8 ) Immediately following this, I communicated with Pierre ( Dell Customer Care Chat ) who told me he had corrected the shipping address and would send the standard PS/2 Keyboard and Mouse to me at the newly corrected address.",0
"He told me that because of all the problems I had been experiencing, I did not have to return the wireless combo, but that I would receive credit for it.",1
"Ho told me that he had issued a credit for $ 55.28"" which is what I had paid for it.""",0
"I explained that I had paid $ 65, and that the amount he referred to was the"" October Special"" price, but he disagreed.",0
"9 ) I contacted Dell for a month, no less than 20 times via e-mail, online chat, and Telephone, attempting to have the shipping address corrected and get the Keyboard and mouse sent to me at the correct address and to issue me the remaining $ 9.62 credit for the Wireless combo.",1
"10 ) On October 11, order # 530622076 showed as having shipped.",0
"To this day, it remains"" In Transit.""",0
"11 ) On October 12, I received credit for $ 55.27 for the $ 65 wireless combo purchased with the PC ordered in September.",0
"12 ) I continued to contact Dell Customer Care via e-mail, Customer Care Chat, and telephone on nearly a daily basis.",0
( I have saved all inbound and outbound e-mails and chats. ),0
"Dell repeatedly apologized for the problems I experience, but nobody seemed to be able to resolve the matter.",0
"13 ) In early November, Raymond DTC28723 promised me that he would ship the standard Keyboard and Mouse to my home address.",0
"He requested, and I provided the correct shipping information.",0
"No shipment ever appeared, and no shipment ever occurred.",1
"14 ) On November 21, Raymond DTC28723 promised me that he would ship the standard Keyboard and Mouse to my home address.",0
"He requested, and I provided the correct shipping information.",0
"15 ) On November 21, I found Order # 542456257 was entered, showing the"" ship date"" as December 2. It was, unfortunately, not for"" Keyboard,104,6P, United States, Multi-Media,NMB"" ( standard PS/2 Keyboard and Mouse ) but rather, for another Dell Wireless Combo.",1
"I e-mailed Raymond DTC28723 several times, but did not get a reply.",1
"16 ) On November 22, the Shipping status of Order # 542456257 changed to"" Processing, where it has remained to this day.",0
"17 ) On December 2, the"" Ship Date"" of order 542456257 changed to a blank.",0
"When I contacted Dell Customer Care, Raymond DTC28723 replied stating that Dell Financial Services had to approve this as a free shipment.",0
"18 ) On December 2, I posted over 15 separate contact names and addresses that I had been dealing with upon the Dell Customer Care Forum as the"" Dell Wall of Shame"" and filed a Consumer Complaint with",0

"This is simply more of the same, and I am certain that only after judgment has been made against Dell that the matter will be resolved.",0
It is quite frustrating to have to deal with so many individuals who are unable to resolve such a trivial matter.,0
"I have requested, repeatedly, that the matter be escalated to a supervisor, but this has never happened.",1
"In light of my experience, and the similar experiences of many others, I strongly urge any prospective Dell customers to make their purchases from a different company.",0
Addendum:,0
Here is an e-mail I sent in response to an offline conversation with on of the reviewers.,0
"They felt I should add this to my review, that it will help others.",0
Here it is:,0
"If you do decide to buy a dell, make 100 % certain that you order the standard setup.",0
"Then, go back and order any accessories as a separate order.",0
This SHOULD prevent the problems I experienced.,0
"You can purchase upgrades by searching at www.techbargains.com, and get better upgrades for less money.",0

"The one time I dealt with technical support they were prompt, accurate, and helpful.",0
Be advised that Tech Support and Customer Care are different.,0
It is my opinion ( also based upon a conversation with a technical support manager ) that the customer care system is limited because of it's design.,0
Dell is unable to CHANGE anything in an order.,0
"If something is defective, it is easy for dell to ship an exact replacement.",0
This is not where the trouble lies.,1
"BUT, if you decide to CHANGE anything in the order, the system is so inflexible that they are unable to make a change.",0
"The Tech Support manager ALSO said that during the 1st 30 days, you may return the system for no charge ( other than what it costs you to ship it back ) so during that 1st 30 days, the salesperson with be very accommodating in order to protect their commission.",1
It is after that 30 day period where you are likely to encounter problems since their commission is then secure.,0
"Also, you may wish to look into purchasing the PC of your choice with NO SOFTWARE.",1
"You can then go to your local staples, office max, office depot, etc and buy what you want, and load it yourself for a better performing system.",0
You also get exactly what you want.,0
The final option is to buy from a local business.,0
Even a super-store will offer the advantage of face to face service with a representative if you have problems.,0
The bottom line?,0
The Dell hardware / software package is very cost effective.,0
Do not buy with the expectations that you will get any support if you have problems.,1
"If you go into it with that attitude, you will not be disappointed.",1
"As a computer tech for decades, I am happy to offer assistance to any who ask.",0
"I may be unable to help with specific issues, and I may not be able to respond immediately, but I will do whatever I can to help.",1
"Also, there are forums like Expert-exchange ( do a Google search ) where I am also active.",0
This is a collection of people trying to help one another.,0
"There are professionals who offer help, as well as home users.",0
Take advice with a grain of salt if you have questions.,0
Any Dell can be fit into the same category.,0
Cheap but overpriced.,0
Check out the reviews at www.epininions.com/cmhd_desktops-Dell-general,0
Be sure to click on sort by date.,0
I will start to have Dell of the week reviews.,0
The Dell 2350( MPN-D235RH) is another example of great Gimmick pricing.,0
Based on a comment for the celeron version of these Dell pieces.,0
I felt I couldn't just alter my other review.,0
"However, since Dells have almost the same garbage in different flavors.",0
I can write another piece and cover some of the missing issues.,0
What makes this version different from the celeron version.,0
Maybe you are PAYING $ 600 more for the privilege of saying you have a OEM version P4 Intel 2.5GHz processor.,0
"Wow, that upgrade must really hurt for investors impressed by the upsell of another OEM processor.",0
OEM again means Dell is burning the clock on a 30 day warranty from Intel.,0
"Not you, the perspective.",1
Your warranty on the processor will most likely have been expired several days / months before your machine ever ships.,0
You'll never know.,1
Except for the time your frustration and stress factors build as you wait for your machine to be fixed.,0
The cases on any Dell are almost identical.,0
"A lot of research and money put into appeal, but not functionality.",1
Can you believe a computer company is still installing 250W power supplies in their computers?,0
Technology leader.,0
What a joke.,0
Sales leader of Junk is more appropriate.,0
"Maybe in the future, when Dell catches up with the technology leaders, a Dell case will support 10 bays as the majority of quality cases do.",0
As well as a minimum 300-350W power supply.,0
The only valuable piece of hardware in this Dell is actually the Harmon Kardon Speakers.,0
And surprisingly Dell lets you know it is included in the system.,0
Are you curious?,0
Now ask who the manufacturers are for the rest of the computer.,0
"Wow, it comes with a 15"" Flat screen.",0
Right click on the screen.,0
Go into settings tab.,0
Click on advanced button.,0
Pick monitor tab.,0
"Change the monitor frequency to 75 Hertz, which is a minimum cofortable setting for human vision.",0
These very cheap flat screens will start freaking out above 70 Hertz.,0
"Plus again, An embarrassing manufacturer Dell is to embarrassed to disclose.",0
And no Dell is not the manufacturer.,1
Memory is coming down in pricing.,0
But Microsoft is always requiring more.,0
And other than being some of the lowest quality Dell memory for a computer.,0
This is where Dell will make up for that low price.,0
XP operating systems require having a minimum of 128MB to run effectively.,0
If you need to add programs.,0
You need to add memory.,0
Dell upgrades are truly overpriced.,0
"So when you believe you are moving toward an Ultimate platform, You are really progressing toward an ultimate reaming.",0
For a modern system you are really being mislead with only 128MB of memory.,0
This model does come with 512MB.,0
But what is it?,0
It is not Dell memory.,1
It only has a Dell logo on it.,0
The Motherboard in this pile is a microboard.,0
"Great for an office environment, Internet only surfing, or elementary and pre-adolescents.",0
Dell motherboards have very secretive Specs and very poor architecture.,0
A good reason for a company to maintain a large repair and engineering staff.,0
Bios is locked down and very difficult to enter.,0
Almost every other manufacturer of motherboard is not afraid to give knowledgeable or trained individuals the capability to enter the bios settings.,1
"But then again, some people need to hide the truth.",0
"Most, if not all microboards have around 2 PCI slots and an AGP slot.",1
"They will have Integrated Video, LAN, and typically AC97 audio.",0
Do you feel the surge of excitement when you find out your system has Intel 3d Extreme Graphics?,0
OOOh! sorry truthfully you only an on board video chipset with 32MB capabilities.,0
And it pulls from your memory cache.,0
"So, remember your 128MB system.",0
It is now only about 96MB at full speed.,0
When you move into CD-Roms.,0
I was asked the question of what the difference is between a 48x and 52x.,0
The answer is very little.,0
around 400k per second.,0
"However, we are in the 21st century or so I had thought.",0
That is not meant to be an offensive statement to the commentator by the way.,1
That was an excellent question.,0
It seems to me that 48x were available around the turn of the century or before.,0
We sell DVD 16x for $ 65 off the shelf.,0
And my cost is so insignificant between CD-rom and DVD that I hardly ever try to sell CD-Rom unless a perspective just has to pinch those pennies.,0
I just wonder how much dust is being blown off those CD-Roms before they go into a supposed new Dell.,0
This model does come with a 16x DVD-rom.,0
But again who is the manufacturer?,0
Why is Dell afraid to disclose who makes their parts?,0
Sorry people their is nothing that Dell has actually made themselves except the Dell logo on the case and the sticker on their imaged software.,0
"And just remember, Upgrade means nice commission increase to a dell salesteam.",0
The Hard drives in these systems are truly another joke.,0
Or another question for turn of the century.,0
5400 RPM usually.,0
That is almost as fast as a Volkswagon diesel car climbing a hill with a 5 % grade.,0
Let the old have a peaceful euthanization.,0
Even 7200 RPM has been updated with 10K RPM hard drives.,0
And 10K is as fast as owning a SCSI hard drive for a third of the price.,0
You just can not Daisy chain several IDE hard drives.,1
Another modern convenience is the development or hard drives with 8MB caches.,0
Or memory on the hard drive.,0
"Hard to believe but it allows faster file accessing, and internet or web caching.",0
Memory is local to the hard drive instead of pulling resources from the memory on the motherboard.,0
"This model surprisingly has a 7200 RPM HDD, But it does not have the 8MB cache and it is also an unknown or generic manufacturer that Dell is too embarrassed to disclose.",1
One of the greatest jokes of owning a Dell machine is their Imaged software and included spamware.,0
It is true some of the other large names use Imaged software.,0
Most of the other names can have a full version operating system installed on them with little or no headaches.,1
Plan on sticking with the Image disk or x-file the Dell where it belongs in some dumpster.,0
The reason you receive Imaged software on systems like this is because of buying in bulk for one.,0
Imaged CD-Rom media is probably pennies for companies like Dell.,0
And they shave around $ 40 dollars per full OS media disk from Microsoft.,0
"If you are happy with your Dell after a few months, you will not care about having imaged Operating System media.",1
"If you are not, sorry can't use your media on different systems.",1
You have to buy imaged software for different machine or purchase full version after learning from your pain.,0
And do plan on a lot of pain if you wish to install full version OS's on a Dell system.,0
Do not be mislead by home version either.,1
"Win 95, 98, millenium, and XP Home is garbage.",0
"I do not recommend, sell, or install this garbage unless a client already has made the mistake of owning it.",1
"If they can return it, I always recommend the wise move.",0
"Lock-ups, poor system resourcing, will not join a domain, No internet firewall.",1
"Hopefully, microsoft will euthanize this worthless, sad architecture.",0
"Invest in XP profesional without Dell, Gateway, or some other companies imaged garbage on the media.",1
You will never regret it.,1
Other than worthless operating system software you will also have several Gigabytes of useless spamware.,0
Great publicity and marketing charges to hopeful companies to place junk and/or unwanted programs on you system.,0
You can plan on losing up to 10GB of your system to this garbage ( i.e.,0
"AOL, Bonzie buddie, music match jukebox, modem on hold, etc. )",0
You really didn't get something for a great price.,0
You still have to pay to get it or make it right in the end.,0
"Last, if not the greatest joke about Dell is their Service and warranty enhancements.",1
"As I have said in a previous review, it is a wise investment for a phone headset with a dell machine.",0
"When you call for support, you can rest your arms or twiddle your thumbs.",0
Plus if you are a light sleeper you can rest while you wait for help.,0
Next day support does not mean your system is fixed the next day.,1
"You will hopefully get a call, for a scheduled repair.",0
"Also, as our company is sub-contracted by a Dell agent, your support is usually provided by a sub-contracted local computer store or individual.",0
You should not have to Pay an extra for something that is usually provided by manufacturers of quality components.,1
Quality parts typically come with a 3 year manufacturer warranty.,0
Some people have a tolerance for pain.,0
If you plan on buying a Dell Plan on the enhancement for as long as you plan to have it.,0
"Or research some companies like ours, who stand behind their systems locally.",0
We have been in this business for over 12 years with hundreds of computer builds and our phones are not ringing off the hook for returns or low quality systems.,1
Case in point,0
"We just sold 2 systems to a client with this Dell comparison including a 17"" Black LCD.",0
Exactly what this system has with the included hidden specs for $ 1493 ea.,0
"The perspective had initiated an order with Dell, but called back for immediate termination after my following proposal:",0

Limited 1 year warranty,0
I sold 2 systems and made over $ 450 profit from each.,0
"After limited warranty if anything does happen to fail, rarely.",0
Client pays shipping and we help with RMA.,0
We don't have to worry about this promise because quality parts with 3 year warranties rarely fail.,0
"Also if you prefer an intel system as we are Intel and AMD partners, add $ 150 and my systems will still out-perform and stand above any Dell system.",0
There are quality and Leading technology computer companies out there if you put some effort into the search.,0
And if you are foolish or have the opportunity to pay those Dell upgrades.,0
"Instead of PAYING for it, INVEST and INVESTIGATE a more custom system.",0
"If you can break the $ 1000 dollar investment range, companies like ours will kick the crap out of any Dell quote for price, quality, and performance.",0
"Any company, who puts so much effort into marketing, needs it to sell low quality products.",0
I truly do not mind making lots of money off of Dell service work.,1
But the complaints are really over-whelming.,0
And I really would like to recommend K-y or vaseline and tell Whiny Dell owners to accept the inevitable.,0
Bend over and take Dell like a......,0
I have to truly applaud Dell for their sales abilities.,0
"If you are willing to Invest $ 1500 dollars, You should have a great entry to mid level system.",0
"However, It will never be a Dell.",1
Not in my opinion and I believe several of the silent majority as well.,1
Or individuals who are to embarrassed to admit they feel like they flushed their money down the toilet.,0
"I hate seeing the pain on clients faces, when they enter our store with yet another fairly new Dell.",0
""" Please fix it, I can't get any help from Dell support."""" I'm",0
"tired of being on the phone for what seems like hours with someone truly unhelpful."""" Yes,",0
"I do have a service /warranty contract, little good it does me.""""It's",0
"not even 6 months old, why the hell is it not working.""",1
""" How much to fix it??"" And the Dell pain goes on and on.",0
Now riddle me this.,0
If your sales people were not super friendly and helpful about selling a pile of crap would they still work for you?,0
Of course Dell sales is exceptional.,0
"With as much money as Dell puts into Marketing and TV, It is no wonder people can follow their animals around the yard.",1
"Scooping up something to hide in a colorful, fancy wrapper.",0
"And calling it a Dimension, or whatever.",0
There is always someone who will buy it.,0
Overall,0
Dells suck.,0
"Performance wise, Architecture wise, Modern parts are few and far between.",0
"Yes, it is cheap.",0
Until the upgrades and enhancements come into play.,0
Then you would have been better off researching local references.,0
The most entertaining thing is to see reviews from people who have owned their Dells for less than 3-4 months.,0
"Please....Any intelligent person can put together a system and make it seem like the latest, fastest, and coolest rocket ship.",0
Wait until you own it more than the return period or closer to expired warranties.,0
Experience some Dell support.,0
Than write your reviews.,0
"And hopefully, also weed out some of the Dell employees who are obligated to write reviews.",0
"If you like large names and fancy marketing, buy a gateway system.",0
Ask for a full version Operating system.,0
Have someone with experience do an install with pro version.,0
SAY NO to free spamware.,1
It's on the internet if you really want it.,0
You will enjoy a lot less stress and aggravation.,0
Or research and investigate some local companies and their references.,0
Be smart and Be happy.,0
Buying a computer is as important as shopping for a good vehicle.,0
"Dell is just a large, slick car lot.",0
"The new Apple 12-inch Powerbook ( PB) notebook computer is a sleek idea with some special features for a compact computer, but it overheats with extended use.",0
"Specifically, when using the computer for over one hour, and especially when multitasking with programs, ( i.e.",0
"word processing and listening to a CD ), the computer becomes exceedingly hot on the surface where the palm/wrists rest when using the keyboard and tracking pad.",0
"The excessive heat is not only distracting and unpleasant, it is unhealthy as heat inflames the tendon sheath associated with carpal tunnels syndrome ( CTS ).",1
"Notebook computers get hot, but the design and internal fan should dissipate the heat so it does not radiate upward on the working surface.",1
"This is a new compact model, and others have reported this over-heating design flaw; there are over 200 related postings on Apple's own website's discussion forum: ( http://discussions.info.apple.com",0
> PowerBook > PowerBook G4 12/17 Inch > Usage ).,0
This problem has also been discussed in other non-Apple affiliated sources.,0
Apple's warranty for the computer is one year.,0
"In my experience with the 12-inch PB, I spent excessive time on the phone with Apple regarding the overheating.",0
"I took it in for repair twice, but with no improvement.",1
"Apple claims that it is performing within specifications and will not replace, refund, or allow me to trade in the computer for a different model.",1
"On March 26th, Apple released an article concerning the excessive heat:"" PowerBook G4 ( 12-inch ): Feels Warm to the Touch - Article ID:86307"".",0
"In this Apple document, advice is provided to minimize the heat problem by making adjustments to the Power Manager Preference.",0
"Apple Technical Support has also recommended that I purchase a heat transfer device that goes under the PB to elevate it, and to put rubber pads where my hands rest as a barrier from the heat.",0
"This is all commendable advice, but it has not resolved the over-heating problem.",1
"More importantly, one should not pay top dollar for a computer advertised as the top model of its size, only to have to compromise certain features, how many programs operating, or speed, etc.",1
One purchases such a high-end model computer precisely because for high-performance to handle more complicated tasks.,0
"Discussion speculates that in its efforts to produces a powerful, compact, metal encased computer before others, Apple overlooked that the aluminum casing readily radiates heat, ( IBM's ThinkPad notebook computer has metal bottom and top, but a plastic working surface ).",0
"If you are considering switching to Apple because it advertises itself as an out-of-the-box, user-friendly, problem-free alternative to PCs, I would not consider this computer.",1
"Although I am new to Apple, and obviously disappointed with this initial experience, I am not anti-Apple: just use caution.",1
I recommend you visit Apple's own discussion forum on its website before purchasing any of their products.,0
"Certain flaws, such as overheating, will not be apparent until you find yourself at home with the computer.",1
"Also, I do not recommend buying the first line of a new model computer, but wait until it has been out a while so the problems can be worked out.",1
I have been a Mac user for many years.,0
When I started a consultancy business recently I bought an Apple Ti Powerbook.,0
It nearly cost me the business.,0
The packaging was delightful as was the design.,0
"Lots of curious and envious looks whenever it came out of its bag in meetings, presentations and cafes!",0
"Other pluses were the battery life, beautiful screen and thin profile.",0
Unfortunately I was forced to sell it due to on-going reliability and engineering issues.,0
These became so bad the unit was no longer reliable.,1
I could not trust it - even started to really really hate it.,1
The battery connection was very unreliable.,0
I have had many embarassing unexpected shutdowns midway through important presentations.,0
"What made it worse was I work with predominantly Windows-based clients, and having to defend this non-Windows laptop was no enviable task.",1
The screen did not close properly from day one.,1
The right edge floated above the bottom chassis when shut.,0
"There was no protection for the screen when shut - one day I found a wad of business cards had actually fallen in between the screen and the base, this was with the lid shut!",1
I hated the slot drive after about the 5th use.,0
"Imagine not being able to return a disc a client had asked me to look at because it was stuck inside this expensive"" toy""!",1
"Bad news was I could not remove the useless drive, thus having to still carry it around despite not using it.",1
"Heat was an issue, the very loud fan was a right embarassment in the boardroom ( where there were other noticeably quieter Windows laptops around ).",0
To top it all off Apple's service was slow and dogged by part shortages ( good intentions only went so far ).,0
There were only so many weeks I could be without a computer.,1
I believe my business (certainly my sanity ) suffered because of the poor quality of this laptop.,0
I switched to an IBM thinkpad after this.,0
"It was cheaper, very solidly built, quiet, and came with 3 year return to base warranty ( compared with Apple's 1 ).",0
And Windows is not bad after you get used to it.,1
I've owned my titanium powerbook for 3 months.,0
"It's beauty is apparent in pictures, but you have to own and use it for awhile",0
to learn of its problems.,0
-fragile (titanium is strong but this machine's shell is paper-thin and even titanium is weak when stretched like,0
onion skin ),0

#NAME?,0
#NAME?,1
"( that is, the decor on certain dvd's, the little picture on the back, is sometimes printed too thick",0
"or too uneven for the DVD drive to handle, and the DVD drive goes nuts when presented with a Cd",0
like this; ordinary pc's can handle this but the Titanium powerbook has little to no tolerance for,1
any CD/DVD deviation from perfect ).,0
-mine arrived with a battery that cuts out and FALLS OUT ( the battery actually fell out once when I lifted,0
the machine.,0
It bounced off the table and back up hitting AND DENTING the underside of the powerbook! ),0
-I sent the machine back and APPLE replaced the DVD and HARDDRIVE;,0
#NAME?,1
#NAME?,0
"I dropped the powerbook, only about 4 inches to the tabletop, but I dropped it, AND IT COMPLETELY CRUMPED UP!! Like a car with crumple zones, and that's when I saw how THIN the titanium really is.",0
It's absurdly thin.,0
Any thinner and you'd be able to see through it.,0
I paid for this repair.,0
"Apple returned it all fixed, completely revamped.",0
"Two weeks later, and believe me I handled it with kid gloves, VERY carefully after its return, two weeks later",0
it froze every time I booted up.,0
I spent 2.5 hours on Apple tech support.,0
The guy gave up.,0
I'm sending it back,0
in for a free repair yet again.,0
This will mark the FOURTH repair since I've owned this machine.,0
I've owned it for THREE MONTHS!!!!,0
"Okay, one of those repairs was my fault, so consider it THREE REPAIRS.",0
I suggest to you that,0
3 repairs in 3 months is 3 too many.,0
"This machine is beautiful but fragile and tempermental, probably owing to its slimness.",0
I imagine all sorts,0
of problems stem from the slim space Apple has fit this machine into.,0
If you buy it don't say I didn't warn you.,1

I purchased the sony PCG-FRV25 on recomendation from a pc sales person.,0
I want it for real estate purposes.,0
But it has been nothing but a total disappointment.,0
"The worst thing is it's terribly slow boot speed, and I don't even run a fire wall or any back ground virus checker.",1
Secondly it sometimes locks up and or takes like five to ten minutes to catch up to a web page request.,0
"It won't even let me shut it down, it will just hang.",1
It also won't even allow me to burn a back up disk it aborts half way through.,1
"I have an old 500 megahertz coppermine desk top, that runs circles around this peace of junk.",0
"I am seriously thinking of taking it back and stopping payment on it, but then I have wasted weeks of loading and working with all my programs.",0
Anyway don't say I didn't warn you.,0
"And, thereis always a chance that I happened to get a big lemon.",0
"On the paper this machine has everything to please a customer: power, big screen, universal DVD+ or DVD- writer.",0
The first big surprise is the weight.,0
Wow!,0
You won't take it with you if you're a frequent flyer!,0
"The machine itself is heavy, but add the heavy battery to it and the incredibly heavy and bulky AC power and then you're done with your daily fitness.",0
Incompatibility issues are also a concern.,0
I have two USB devices that just don't work on this laptop.,0
"They work on IBM, HP and even crappy clones like Acer or Dell.",0
No way to have them work.,1
"Sony is famous to be""almost compatible"" with everything but here you have to insure this to the customer.",0
USB is supposed to be UNIVERSAL!,0
Support is almost inexistent.,0
"Besides the""it's not our fault it's the other ones"" you can't count on anything.",1

"Fan noise: well, if you like to live next to an airport, you'll love the GRV616S!",0

"It's simple, that's the only thing you hear.",0
Even in quite mode ( at lower speed ) you still hear it.,0
It makes much more noise than any desktop PC I've ever owned.,0
My former laptop was an HP Omnibook 6000.,0
"As a developer, I pushed it to the limits by compiling long projects in C++ ( sometimes compiling for 6 hours ).",0
I used to hear its fan something like 3 minutes total.,0
"Here, even if you don't do anything, well, it's covering any other noises!",1
It drives everybody crazy.,0
So don't even think about using it in a library.,1
You won't be allowed!,0

Nice idea to have a universal one.,0
But why does it need to take between 45 to 90 seconds each time you insert a disk in it before giving the CPU back to Windows?,0
"It burned DVD+RW like breeze, without problems and was surprisingly fast.",1
It failed and destroyed in all my DVD-RW.,0
The keyboard is noisy and flaky.,0
The mousepad ways too sensitive.,0
Type in a text for 3 minutes and the mouse cursor will start jumping around the screen just because of the heat of your thumbs over it.,0

"We ordered a $ 6,000 souped up model ( maximum hard drive, RAM, processors, etc. )",0
It worked briefly each time we picked it up after repair.,0
We knew immediately that it should not rev up like a jet engine immediately upon booting and never slow down.,1
"It has frozen up, failed to recognize the operating system, take fifteen minutes to boot up...you name it, it hasn't worked.",1
"We do massive Final Cut Pro editing and looked forward to the machined used to create"" Finding Nemo.""",0
"Last night, we bought our 8th external hard drive so we could back up the one drive that is working on our G5.",0
"They are trying it out with the original hard drive ( smaller, but if it works, fine with us ) to see if it can find its brain again.",0
"We are about to seek a refund for our $ 6,000 purchase.",0
"If it worked, it would be worth it... because when it does work, it is a productivity dream.",0
But it's now a nightmare,0
"It pains me to rate my iMac so low because I have been a Mac booster for many years, after converting from a PC.",0
I will say up front that I am not a computer nerd and need something simple that I can operate without reading a lot of books or going to school.,1
"A long time ago I returned a new desktop PC to Gateway because I couldn't operate it intuitively ( my fault ), and Gateway graciously took it back, no questions asked.",1
I then bought a new little Mac 160 notebook and was immediately able to operate it.,0
I used it for years until it finally smoked its motherboard and had to be replaced.,0
"The next computer was another Mac notebook, a 5300 CS, which was not one of Apples finest products, but nonetheless it was fairly efficient and easy to operate.",1
It finally lost the top half of its color LCD and ran out of memory and I was again forced to buy a new computer.,0
The jazzy new iMac looked like just the ticket.,0
I now own iMac serial number 0T213E6FMAY.,0
"My iMac was trouble from the start and I got no help from Apple other than advice, and after 90 days I couldn't even get that unless I forked over an extra [ $ $ $ ] for an extended warranty, which I did.",1
Here are just a few of my complaints:,0
The iMac functions pretty much like a PC and is no longer as intuitive as the earlier Apple products they built their ease of operation reputation on.,1
"2. At times the screen locks up, the"" OFF"" button won't work, and the only way to shut it down is to unplug it from the wall.",1
"3. The"" OFF"" button is located near the left-back of the body in a hard-to-reach place, accessible only with the left hand, not the right, a very poorly thought out location.",1
"4. There is no"" ON-OFF"" switch on the keyboard.",0
"5. The so-called""SLEEP"" function doesn't always work like it should, certainly not like the earlier notebooks.",1
It sometimes awakens hung up.,0
"6. Sometimes when the shut-down command is given it only goes into the sleep mode, can't be shut down by the"" OFF"" button, and has to be unplugged from the wall for a forced shut-down.",0
On re-booting after such a forced shut down the system has to go through an automatic hard drive assessment before it is again functional.,0
Even after such a shutdown and hard drive assessment the system sometimes doesn't work right.,0
"7. Apple has loaded so much unnecessary""bloatware"" bells and whistles into their OX10 and 9.2.2 operating systems there is no way an ordinary user can operate it easily.",0
Even my paid Apple authorized technicians have had difficulties working out the wrinkles.,0
I never know what to expect next.,1
"8. The optical mouse clicker was too sensitive, even at full adjustment for firmer spring resistance.",0
I replaced it with a Logitech optical mouse.,0
After years of using Apple products I may go back to a PC because my iMac no longer offers the advantages Macs once had over PC's.,1
It doesn't matter to me if the problems stem from Apple software or hardware; the trouble remains and is still real.,1
Software unready for the market is just as bad as a defective motherboard design.,0
"A top notch professional computer technician recently told me that Mr. Steve Jobes' tech meddling is responsible for the newest G4 Macs no longer operating with the traditional intuitive ease of the earlier Macs, to say nothing of the continual technical glitches.",1
I have heard similar complaints from other iMac owners.,0
"You won't see this in the advertising, and some iMac users are reluctant to admit the weaknesses of their expensive new toys.",0
I am not one of them.,1
"For a person on a semi-limited budget, I wanted a computer that would give me the most bang for the buck.",0
This was my first computer purchase.,0
I knew ( or at least I THOUGHT I knew ) that I couldnt get a decent Windows PC for about a grand.,0
All I heard was how powerful and easy Mac's are to use.,0
So I decided on the iMac.,0
"I've had it a couple weeks, and after a few incidents that made me want to kick the thing out the window, I am now writing this review with a cool and logical head.",0
"i want to do an illusion and reality comparison of this computer...this is based on the research I did on the Mac before buying it, and the reality of the darn thing that Im living with.",0
Illusion: the Mac is a powerful computer that is easy to setup and use.,0
Fact: its not really all that powerful or easy to setup. the sales guy told me I'd be ready to go right out of the box.,1
Yeah right.,0
"I know, Im naive...like I said i never bought a computer before.",1
"For something so powerful, it certainly does NOT like to do more than one application at once.",1
"IFor example, if you are using iTunes to import songs onto the hard drive and want to go on to the internet, forget it.",0
its slow as molasses.,0
"As a matter of fact, the only application that works at regular speed with another application running is the stupid chess game.",0
Its not even specifically with iTunes...try running any two applications and everything slows down to snail's pace.,1
Illusion: the imac comes with a 56K modem for decent internet connection speed.,0
Reality: it will never connect at higher than 32K.,1
"Calls to Earthlink and Apple Care Support say there's nothing really that can be done about it, unless i can eliminate all the supposed line noise in the phone system.",0
"I use to own a webtv unit, and to be honest, webtv was faster than the imac is for accessing internet pages from the same phone line.",0
"i dont know, I pick up the phone and I dont hear any noise whatsoever.",0
Illusion: Mac OS X is the best OS thing to come along since sliced bread.,0
Fact: This stupid OS X in incredibly slow and frustrating to use.,0
"I believe that the OS X is mostly responsible for the turtle like speed of the system, it does run better in 9.1.",0
It also needs to switch freqently between X and 9.1 to run some applications.,0
this also takes up more time and slows everything down.,0
"And Im sorry, I hate the friggin dock.",0
It's too big and gets in the way of everything Im trying to do.,0
"I know you can reduce it in size, but then when I get it to the point where its not blocking scroll bars or Appleworks controls, its too small to read.",1
"It has a hiding function, and the dock pops up when the mouse is on the bottom of the screen.",0
"That seems to be the best option, though sometimes it doesnt respond properly.",0
"and for some reason, every time I restart ot shut down the computer, all of my icons are re-aranged on the desktop in weird locations.",0
Whats up with that????,0
illusion: iTunes is a revolutionary music program.,0
fact: it would be great if you could just copy a CD straight up.,0
"But no...you have to import the whole CD to your hard drive, make a seperate playlist for it, burn it, than delete everything-one song at a time so you dont overcrowd the HD.",0
What a drag.,0
"While im on the subject, the volume control for this thing sucks.",0
"its like there's 5 settings: Off, loud, louder, loudest, and deafening.",0
Not good for late night listening in the house when all are asleep.,1
"Also, the CD eject button only seems to work when it feels like it.",0
It malfunctions at least 1 out of every 3 attempts.,0
and why?,0
"Well, because the manual says you have to quit all other applications first.",0
"HUH?!?!?!? Im no computer genious, but how much friggin memory is needed to eject a CD? Come on!!!!! Another example of the multi-tasking suckiness of this thing.",1
"Also on my list of complaints are not enough USB ports ( 2 ), and Apple Care Support.",1
Why the support staff?,0
"Well, when you call them they give you the impression that you are an idiot if you dont know this stuff already.",0
I had once person laugh at me.,0
"Not very professional, no matter how bad I screwed up.",1
I didnt pay 150 bucks for a warranty to be made fun of.,1
A-holes.,0
I will probably update this review when the OS 10.1 update comes out.,0
Supposedly it will speed up the system quite a bit...we'll see.,0
"As it stands, I would not recommend the iMac to anyone, especially if you need a computer that can do more than one thing at a time effectively.",1
"This thing just sucks at multi-tasking, theres no better way to put.",1
"For the money, I imagine you could get something WAY better than this overpriced-for-what-it-does machine.",0
"If I could do it again, I would have bought the iMac model for 999, and upgraded the memory later.",0
This thing is not as fast as i was led to believe.,1
I also was disappoined in the lack of a DVD-rom drive.,0
I feel kind of ripped off and misguided in making this purchase.,0
"I guess theres a reason Windows PC's are so popular, they just seem to work better.",0
"Quite frankly, I think this iMac is a piece of junk.",0
I'd take it back were it not for those stupid open-box fees.,1
"I'll live with it for the next 3 years, just not happily.",1
"please, do shop around before you consider buying this thing.",0
"Mac has fashioned a prettier toaster in the form of its new desktop, but unfortunately, the toast does not taste better.",1
"My difficulties with using this product are numerous, and the fact that Mac has only 5 % of the market share on computers is fully understandable; they make a terrible product that is not very compatible with standard software, the Microsoft Office Suite of applications.",1
"First, there is no scroll-to-zoom feature.",1
"This means that the mouse wheel cannot be used to zoom in and out ( enlarge or minimize ) a document for editing, proofing, or viewing.",1
"More insulting, no mouse driver is available on the internet to install this essential feature that is STANDARD on Windows machines.",1
"Many sites offer such a driver, but I have yet to find one that works at all.",0
"To this end, I purchased 3 mouse accessories and none were able to zoom within a document.",1
"Also, assigning shortcut keys to applications by way of the tools menu causes the machine to lock up, necessitating rebooting.",0
Assigning shortcuts keys are essential for more proficient computer users.,0
"Thus, this is a debilitating fault.",0
"Worse, word and excel seem to lack features that are standard devices on the PC.",0
"Standard shortcut key assignments in word applications are not cross-application translatable in Excel or PowerPoint, although these three applications appear in a suite for purchase and are most compatible in this manner on a PC!",1
"The Mac product seems to persist like an uninvited houseguest, overstaying its welcome or utility.",0
"Frankly, Mac has made my job more difficult or downright impossible with inefficient document handling and un-user friendly filing systems.",0
"Also, having to drag down a menu bar just to perform a function is a time-waster.",0
Almost everything on a PC is key-able.,0
"No mouse is needed for the most common tasks, making usage a breeze for the more dexterous.",1
"Also, the Macs horrible desktop display choices make me feel like a punished three-year-old.",0
"I want to be able to alter every element of my desktop appearance ( including the way Word, PowerPoint, and Excel appear when I am working within these applications ) like I can on a PC?",0
What purpose does it serve to hold the Mac user hostage to someone elses factory preferences?,0
"Finally, memory problems on the Mac abound, causing system crashes daily.",0
This does not contribute to productivity.,1
"Mac causes problems, and solves no problems.",1
Technical support at Apple borders on IRS-style hostility.,0
"I was told that my brand new iMac was 8 years old, based on the serial number I gave the lady over the phone.",0
She refused to help me past that point unless I bought support!,0
What a rip-off.,0
My department bought a useless desktop and now must spend more for dubious support.,0
I have receive more support from old pantyhose!,0
Get real!,0
Can you afford to be rude to customers who comprise an ever dwindling share of the market?,0
I recommend that Apple go out of business ( and take their tacky support department with them ) and recall its awful products immediately.,0
The Benefits:,0
"For some reason, many people are recommending the iMAC DV+; however, they probably did not have my experience.",1
"I admit it has improved: it now comes with a nicer keyboard, optical mouse and a 20 gig hard drive.",0
I also admit that it is super easy to setup.,0
The Bad News,0
"Unfortunately, this computer burns up.",0
It runs extremely hot.,0
I handled the purchase of one for my college newspaper and it burned up within two weeks of its arrival.,0
"When it first came, I used it to save files on a CD and was amazed how hot the CD was when it came out; however, I dismissed this.",0
Then I felt the top of the computer.,0
It was so hot it hurt to touch it!,0
I should have taken action then but I shut it off and let it cool down.,0
"A week later, I came in after it had been on for a few hours, with the screen saver on.",0
The room was hot and I could smell something.,0
I felt the heat on my face when I got close.,0
"When I tried to get the computer working by moving the mouse, the on light kept getting bright and fading, getting bright and fading; however, the screen never lit up.",1
I turned it off and tried to turn it on.,0
The computer did not boot and has nt since.,1
It is shot.,0
The Conditions,0
It has been recommended to me that I describe the conditions this computer was in.,0
It was in an air-conditioned office.,0
"Also, it is important to note our G3s G4s and 2-year old iMACs are fine.",0
This indicates that our conditions have nothing to do with it.,0
The Good News,0
"Fortunately, it was still under warranty.",0
My Recommendation,0
I strongly recommend that you do not purchase this computer.,1
"However, if you already have one or insist on an Apple, I recommend that you minimize your use of it.",0
"Also, I spoke to a computer repairman who has worked with apple for years.",0
"He remembers the Apples that had the monitor and computer combined, like the iMAC, which many people owned 10 years ago.",0
He said they ran too hot and would be ruined if they were on too long.,0
He suspects that they must have a similar setup.,0
He used to install a fan inside the old computers and thinks something like that will work now.,0
"If you really want one, it would probably be best to have a repairman install a fan like that.",0
The Bottom Line,0
Im not a computer expert but I know money going up in smoke when I see it.,1
Allright I looked at this little computer in the store a couple weeks ago hoping there would be an advancement over the first Imac.,0
Besides a few minor upgrades that just barely met par with technology advancements there were no changes.,1
The sales rep made a big deal out of how there was no fan on the processor and that meant there was such advanced technology.,1
He did not realize he was talking to a man who is an overclocker at heart.,1
If there is no fan all that means is that if there was a fan on the processor then it could be run faster.,1
That means there is wasted hardware potential.,0
"Not only do you pay more for these machines but they are set up so as not to take full potential of their power, which is still pretty limited.",1
The mouse design problems have not been fixed and I still think the thing looks like bas 70's art deco.,1
I don't think it is possible to overclock with the hardware in this machine.,1
They aren't made for adjustment and they just aren't that fast.,1
I'm sorry but this machine is just not worth it,1
Why was I so drawn to the iMac?,0
"You see, for the last 11 years I have been using Microsoft Windows-based machines.",0
"Each version of Windows has been getting better, and XP in particular is quite good.",0
"In fact, going into this purchase, I was quite happy with XP.",0
"Still, roaming the aisles of CompUSA I felt myself being drawn to the iMac.",0
For a few reasons actually.,0
"First, I had continually heard that the Mac made it super easy to manage digital photos and create movies.",0
"Second, I found the design of the iMac very appealing.",0
"I still use a Windows machine for work, so I figured I would take a chance and buy an iMac to replace my Micron PC at home - and I haven't looked back since.",1
INITIAL CONCERNS,0
"Prior to the purchase, I did a bit of research to ensure I wouldn't be making a big mistake.",0
"My home computer had been used primarily for managing photos, creating and editing Microsoft Office documents, videoconferencing (using Messenger in XP), and surfing the net.",0
"With the iMac, I wanted to add making movies to the repertoire.",0
One thing that I discovered that eased my decision was the fact that MS Office documents now share the same file format for Mac and PC.,0
"My assumption was that the Mac version would require different file formats ( requiring a conversion at either end ), and this is not the case.",1
"Discovering that I could create a Word, Excel or Powerpoint document and e-mail it to a PC without any worries was a beautiful thing.",1
The other thing that was a concern was videoconferencing functionality.,0
"We have family on the other coast, and used the videoconferencing capability built into XP's Messenger to virtually visit these relatives.",0
"The version of MSN Messenger for the Mac does not have this feature, which was initially a bit of a bummer.",1
"However, there was an easy solution.",0
"Yahoo Messenger does have videoconferencing capabilities built-in, and works cross-platform ( Mac to PC ).",0
"In addition, the iSight camera that is available for the Mac is incredible.",0
"It is auto-focus, and the image quality is excellent.",0
Yahoo also offers better video quality as compared to MSN and the built-in version of Messenger available with XP.,0
"If there was one other thing I worried about, it was processor speed.",0
Owning a PC for so many years gets you caught up in thinking about speed simply in terms of the processor speed.,0
"The new PC's were shipping with 3 GHz processors, and here I was contemplating the purchase of a machine with a 1 GHz processor.",0
What was I thinking!,0
"I was told that the Mac and PC process information very differently, and the 1 GHz processor was equivalent to a much faster processor on the PC side.",0
"I put a bit of faith in this explanation, and never let it get in the way of my purchase decision.",1
Once I found that MS Office and videoconferencing would work for me on the iMac - and put aside the processor speed concern - I got out the credit card.,0
"Actually, I bought it from CompUSA and opened a CompUSA credit card account to get 5 % off my purchase as well as 6 months of no interest financing.",1
"They also gave me $ 50 toward the purchase of accessories, which I put toward the purchase of a Canon S400 ( which is phenomenal ).",0
OUT OF THE BOX,0
"One thing that really bugged me about my PC was the sheer number of cables, connectors and general mess it seemed to create on my desktop.",0
"It was so nice taking the iMac out of the box, placing it on my desk, connecting the speakers, keyboard and Ethernet cable to the iMac, connecting the mouse to the keyboard, and done.",0
I am stating the obvious when I say the iMac looked stunning.,0
"It truly is a piece of art, and the build quality is very impressive.",0
The bottom of the iMac was even finished off beautifully with a circular piece of brushed aluminum ( which looks very much like a larger version of what you'd find on the back of a fine watch ).,0
Another aspect of the design that is very nice is the fact that the system is very ergonomically pleasing.,0
"It is amazing how much more comfortable it is (especially at 6'3"" ) to have the screen up nice and high.",0
Apple used a unique mounting system for the monitor which makes it easy to manipulate the screen placement with just one hand with very little effort.,0
The range of movement is vast.,0
"Being tall, I have the screen very high, but someone who likes it lower can lower it all the way down so that the bottom of the screen is only a half inch from the surface of the desk!",0
"From the highest to the lowest setting, there is a range of movement of 7.5 inches!",0
"The LCD flat panel I had on my PC only pivoted up and down to adjust the viewing angle, but it offered no actual vertical movement as with the iMac.",1
"I found that once I started using the iMac, I got way fewer headaches.",0
"With my other monitor, even though the viewing angle was correct after it pivoted upward, I was still looking down at it quite a bit.",0
"This caused the back of my neck to strain after a while, which would sometimes lead to headaches.",0
"The iMac monitor also pivots from side to side, which I haven't found all that useful - but I guess people will use it when they want to show others their work, etc.",0
FEATURES,0
"The iMac is very full-featured, especially considering its diminutive size.",0
"I think anyone buying simply on specs will probably buy a PC, as they are leading the pack from a hardware per dollar standpoint.",0
I was more concerned with real world usability.,0
"Still, for those that must know, here are the specs:",0
1 GHz PowerPC G4 Processor,0
133 MHz bus speed,0
"17"" widescreen digital display",0
"DVD/CD burner ( read: 32x CD/8 x DVD; burn: 8x CD-RW, 16x DD-R, 4x DVD-R )",0
80GB 7200rpm Hard Drive,0
NVIDIA GeForce4 MX 64MB video card,0
256MB DDR SDRAM ( Max 1GB ),0
56K V.92 internal modem,0
2 Firewire ports,0
"2 available USB ports ( after the speakers, and keyboard/mouse are connected )",0
Apple Pro Speakers ( the translucent round speakers ),0
This is probably a good section to comment on the speed of the machine with the 1 GHz processor.,0
"While I have no 3 GHz windows machine to directly compare it to, I can say that I now have no worries about performance.",1
Probably the most processor intensive task I have undertaken on the iMac is movie editing.,0
"For this, I found the iMac to be plenty fast, and at no time did I feel like I needed more speed.",1
"I really feel that the Mac world is more focused on usability than raw speed, as is the case with the PC world.",0
"The PC world is filled with specs and benchmarks, and you don't see this nearly as often in the Mac world ( although you do see it ).",1
The first thing I did to my iMac was to add memory.,0
"From a performance per dollar standpoint, nothing beats additional RAM.",0
So I purchased a 512MB memory board from CompUSA for around $ 120 to bring the total memory up to 768MB.,0
"I have upgraded the memory in all the computers I have owned, so I didn't even bother trying the machine with the 256MB.",0
"Therefore, I couldn't compare the iMac with the standard versus added memory.",0
My recommendation would be for around $ 100 get the extra memory - it's a no brainer.,1
"From a hardware perspective, I should also note that you can get an internal wireless card for the iMac.",0
"The Airport Extreme wireless card for the iMac works with the AirPort Extreme Base Station using 802.11g for up to 54 Mbps, which is about 5 times faster than the currently most popular standard of 802.11b.",0
The Airport Extreme Card is also compatible with 802.11b if you already have a wireless router based on the older standard.,0
"I have a wireless network in my house, but have the iMac sitting next to the router.",0
"Therefore, I just connected it with an Ethernet cable.",0
"However, if I was to place it elsewhere in the house, the internal wireless feature would be nice as it would eliminate an external box.",0
"I have actually thought about putting it in the family room, and since it looks so nice, it would fit right into the decor.",0
"Actually, it would probably enhance it.",0
Another internal option for the iMac is a bluetooth adapter.,0
"However, be aware that this option is only available if you buy your iMac directly through Apple - something I was not aware of prior to purchase!",1
"Since I bought my machine through CompUSA, I wasn't able to get the internal bluetooth.",0
All is not lost however.,1
"First of all, I don't currently have a need for it.",0
"And second, you can buy a tiny D-Link DBT-120 bluetooth adapter that plugs into a USB port for about $ 50.",0
"The D-Link adapter is tiny at 1.81"" x 0.73"" x 0.37"", so you just plug it in and you don't see it.",1
"One thing I would advise is to replace the Apple Pro Speakers with a better system if you are going to do a ton of music listening, as the Pro Speakers have absolutely zero low end.",0
"So far, I have kept them - but I will replace them at some point.",0
GETTING STARTED,0
I turned on the machine and went through the setup procedure.,0
"In a matter of minutes, all the necessary information the machine needed was entered, and it had auto-discovered my internet connection.",0
I was ready to roll.,0
"When first using the iMac, one word comes to mind, and that is"" slick"".",0
Everything looks so nice and crisp and stylish.,0
"The way the icons look, and the way the applications launch.",0
"It's all, well, very slick!",0
"The 17"" widescreen display is absolutely stunning.",0
The images seem to jump off the screen they are so lifelike.,0
"Unlike most PC's that convert the digital image to analog, where it is sent through a cable to the monitor, the iMac display has a direct digital connection to the video card.",0
The high-quality of the monitor combined with the digital connection is what makes the monitor look the way it does.,0
"I started playing around with the applications, and they were very intuitive.",0
Anyone used to a Windows machine will find it very easy to use the Mac.,0
"Sure, it is slightly different, but the general concepts of pulldown menus are the same.",0
The one thing I did notice however is that I missed a 2-button mouse.,0
"I have no idea why Apple choose not to include a 2-button mouse on this machine, as the OS X operating system supposedly does support 2-button mouse operation ( although it supposedly doesn't offer as extensive support for 2-button operation as compared to Windows ).",1
The mouse it ships with actually doesn't have any buttons at all.,1
"Rather, you simply push down on the mouse itself and the whole mouse""is"" the button.",0
"Since you can use any portion of the mouse to click, I found myself"" thinking"" that I had clicked the right side and waiting for a menu to pop up.",0
"However, that was not the case, as there really was no second button to click.",1
"I have contemplated buying a 2-button mouse, but the mouse it ships with matches the unit and looks so darn nice with it that I haven't bothered up to this point.",0
I figure Apple will eventually smarten up and offer a 2-button version.,0
Another area where the iMac was lacking was in user switching.,0
My wife and I had separate user accounts on the XP machine.,0
"We could switch back and forth on the XP machine, leaving applications open.",0
"When we switched back, anything we were working on would still be there, ready to work on.",0
"With the Mac and OS X ( also called Jaguar ), you need to completely log off ( and close all applications ) in order to switch between users.",0
"This may not seem like a big deal, but if you are both home throughout the day, and want to jump on the computer from time to time, it becomes an annoyance.",1
"The good news is that the next version of software, called Panther, is due out from Apple on 10/24/03.",0
"Panther adds a number of features, and one of them is user switching similar in functionality to XP.",0
"One other minor issue that took me a little time to get used to was the differences between the""home"" and""end"" keys.",0
"With the Mac, the""home"" key takes you to the beginning of a document versus the beginning of the line with a PC.",0
"The""end"" key on the Mac takes you to the end of the document versus the end of the line with a PC.",0
"To go to the beginning or end of the line on the Mac, you need to use the up and down arrow keys.",0
"Minor quibbles of course, but anyone used to Windows would find it a bit confusing at first - in practice.",0
"Other than the issues mentioned above, I found the iMac and OS X to be very easy to use.",0
"Keep in mind, this was just basic usability, nothing application specific.",0
Read on to find out how the iMac stacked up from an applications standpoint.,0
APPLICATIONS,0
The iLife suite of applications ( which come with the iMac ) was one reason I went with the iMac.,0
"This includes iMovie, iTunes, iPhoto and iDVD.",0
To summarize each application:,0
iMovie - import movies from your camcorder and edit them,0
"iPhoto - import, manage, edit and print photos, easily order prints or photo albums",0
iDVD - put your iMovie projects on DVD and/or create DVD-based slideshows of your photos from iPhoto,0
"iTunes - import, manage music from your CD's or downloaded music",0
"Since the iLife applications are so central to the iMac experience, I wanted to really focus on them from the standpoint of""how"" I use them and how easy they are to use.",0
I really wanted to make movies from the footage I took on my digital camcorder.,0
I also wanted to better manage my digital photos.,0
I found it to be exhausting and tedious to try to find the best application for doing these things on the PC.,0
There were way too many choices.,0
"If people were raving about the Apple applications and how easy they were to use, and I didn't have to go on a search to find the best movie application, best photo application, etc., I would be very happy.",1
"So after playing around with the iMac and getting a feel for it, the next day I focused on the iLife applications.",0
"Over the past few years, I have accumulated many hours worth of video featuring my now 2 year old son.",0
"I had been itching to put them on DVD, but it seemed like such a chore.",0
"I did fool around a little on the PC trying to make a movie, but I didn't find it all that intuitive, and it seemed a little flaky.",1
"About an hour after launching iMovie, my first DVD was DONE, and it looked GREAT.",0
It even had transition effects ( e.g.,0
"fade in, fade out ), titles and credits, and a few songs I imported from some CD's!",0
It was so easy you cannot even imagine.,1
I simply connected my JVC MiniDV camcorder and pressed a button to import the footage.,0
The iMovie application seems to detect the various points in the video where I stopped and started recording.,0
"So different pieces of footage that I took on the same tape were stored on the"" storyboard"" as individual clips.",0
Then I simply took the individual clips and dragged them into a timeline at the bottom of the screen.,0
One clip would run into the other.,0
"However, if I wanted to put in a transition effect between the two clips, I simply selected from a list of effects and dragged the effect icon between the two clips on the timeline.",0
"Super easy, and super intuitive.",0
"You can name each clip, then see a list of the clip names in order to build a""scene selection"" for a DVD ( same as the scene selection feature on DVD's you rent ).",0
"I then used iDVD to burn my movie, and I was loving life.",0
The experience of making my first movie exceeded any and all expectations I had going into the process.,0
"As for performance, it was great.",0
"I would describe it as very responsive, and at no time did I wish it was faster.",1
iPhoto and iTunes are equally as impressive as iMovie and iDVD.,0
iPhoto stores all your photos in a library.,0
"After your photos are stored in the library ( which by default is organized by""roll"" of digital film which is dated and can be renamed to whatever you'd like ), you create albums.",0
You then select pictures from the library and drag them into an album.,0
"You can edit the pictures in the album, and also have a copy of the original stored in the library if you ever want to revert to the original image.",0
I have found iPhoto to be very easy to use and have not even scratched the surface of its capabilities.,1
"For instance, I know you can put in descriptions of individual photos, then search all of iPhoto for photos that contain a keyword.",0
The nice thing is that iPhoto presents you with a super simple and clean interface.,0
"The advanced features are there, but they aren't""in your face"" like they are with PC applications.",0
"Once I got some pictures from my digicam into iPhoto, I also found out how easy it was to e-mail photos to my friends.",0
"With my PC, e-mailing photos that were compressed down to a manageable file size was a big pain.",0
"I would open the photo, resize is, save it as a compressed JPEG, then open Outlook and attach the images to an e-mail and send it.",0
It was a labor intensive process.,0
"With iPhoto, you simply select the photos you want to send, then press the e-mail icon at the bottom of the iPhoto interface.",0
"It brings up a window which allows you to select a size of small, medium, large or full size as well as two check boxes asking whether you want to include comments or titles, and that's it.",0
I usually select medium ( which is 640 x 480 ).,0
"So in other words, I select the photos, click e-mail, click""medium"", then press"" compose"".",0
"This automatically opens up an e-mail with the photos attached, at which time I write my e-mail text and hit send.",0
So easy.,0
"iPhoto also makes it extremely easy for the novice to post their photos to their own internet site with the addition of the.Mac service, but more on that later.",0
"Lastly, you can click on""order prints"" or""order book"" to get your photos professionally processed or to order a hard-bound book containing the photos from any of your albums.",0
"When you order prints, the order is handled by Kodak.",0
"Not sure who makes the albums, as I have not done this yet, but they look beautiful.",1
They are hard bound and covered in linen in a variety of colors.,0
A 10 page album will run about $ 30.,0
Prints are $ 0.49,0
"for 4 x 6, $ 0.99 for 5 x 7, $ 3.99 for 8 x 10 and go all the way up to $ 19.99 for a 20 x 30.",0
"These services are commonplace for PC users, but the fact that they are so tightly integrated into iPhoto makes the process of ordering them MUCH easier.",0
It takes so little time that it is actually fun versus a laborious task.,0
iTunes along with the Apple Music Store makes it a pleasure to get into music on your computer.,0
"This is something that has been intriguing to me, but have never done it because it isn't all that intuitive on the PC.",1
It's not that it isn't possible.,1
It's just that I never wanted to take the steps to learn.,1
"With iTunes, there is no learning.",1
"You just pop a CD in, iTunes opens, and you can either listen to it or drag songs into your music library.",0
It couldn't be easier.,0
iTunes works like iPhoto in terms of having a library and then playlists ( equivalent to albums in iPhoto ).,0
"All your music gets placed into the library, then you create playlists which organize the music in the library.",0
"So I may drag one song into my"" Mellow"" playlist, and another in my"" Classical Music"" playlist.",0
"You name the playlists however you want, and organize them accordingly.",0
"Another very nice feature of iTunes is that along with your library and playlists, iTunes also has a"" Music Store"" icon.",0
Select this icon and it connects directly into Apples online music download service called the Apple Music Store.,0
"The beauty of this is that it doesn't open an internet browser, necessitating a second interface to deal with.",0
"Rather, the music is right there in iTunes.",0
"When your music library or playlists are selected, the search bar at the top of iTunes lets you search your own music for a group or a song.",0
"When you select the Music Store, the same search bar lets you search their online database.",0
"If you want to buy a song, you do it right within iTunes.",0
"After the song is downloaded, you can simply drag it into one of your playlists just like any other song.",0
"It is very simple, and very easy to do.",0
"Notice that""easy"" seems to be a recurring theme here?",0
I would say that Apple has not done enough to promote the iLife applications.,1
"Sure, the thought of these built in applications was appealing to me, and was a reason for purchasing the iMac.",0
"However, I didn't expect them to transform the way I used a computer.",1
"These applications far exceeded my expectations, and if I was running Apple I would make even more of an effort in promoting them.",0
"With my PC, even though it was capable of making movies and managing music, I had never actually done it due to the fact that it was too much of a bother to figure out.",1
"With iMovie and iTunes, it was a joy to do both.",0
"Also, iPhoto makes it much easier to manage and share your photos, which means that I feel confident my photos are where I want them, and easy to get to - versus lost in the midst of some folder somewhere.",0
"In addition to the iLife suit of applications, some other applications the unit ships with are iCal, iChat, Address Book and Mail.",0
"Obviously the person who decided not to put an""i"" in front of Mail and Address Book is no longer with the company!",1
"iCal is obviously a calendar application ( not a calculator, but the iMac does come with one of those too ).",1
iChat is an instant messaging application that works between Macs and also is compatible with AOL Instant Messenger.,0
"iChat does not support cross-platform ( Mac to PC ) videoconferencing, so I have not used it yet.",1
"As I mentioned earlier, I am using the Yahoo Messenger for this.",0
Address Book and Mail are just what they sound like.,0
"They are both very basic applications, but they do have one advantage.",0
"That is, they integrate well with other Apple software.",0
"If you are used to Outlook, you will NOT like Address Book, Mail and iCal, as they are all SEPARATE applications.",1
No idea why Apple decided on this.,1
"It's actually not quite as bad as it sounds, as the applications do offer some integration/interaction with one another.",1
"For example, if you are in Mail, you can click an e-mail and select""add this person to your address book"", and it will add that contact to Address Book ( without having to open the Address Book application ).",1
"Still, if you are an Outlook fan, then Microsoft Office X comes with Entourage X, which is a Mac version of Outlook.",0
"I loaded Entourage X to try it out, and I liked it very much.",0
"However, I eventually stopped using it in favor of the Apple applications.",0
"Not because I thought they were better, but rather because iCal, Address Book and Mail seemed to integrate better with the other Apple applications.",1
"For example, when I wanted to e-mail photos from iPhoto, iPhoto does offer you the option of selecting Apple Mail or Microsoft Entourage as the default mailer.",0
"However, when I tried to have iPhoto send photos through Entourage, I got an error message.",0
"I switched it to Apple Mail, and it worked flawlessly.",0
That was enough to sell me on the idea of sticking with the Apple Applications.,0
Hopefully they will improve them over time.,0
"I have the luxury of managing my calendar and the majority of my contacts on my work machine, which is a PC running Outlook.",0
So my iMac is primarily used for e-mail and managing some personal contacts.,0
"If I managed my business contacts on the iMac, I would definitely toss iCal, Address Book and Mail in favor of Entourage.",0
INTERNET AND THE.MAC SERVICE,0
I didn't find much of a difference between the PC and Mac from a web-surfing standpoint.,0
One thing I guess I did notice was that Internet Explorer offered slower performance than it does on the PC platform.,0
The iMac does come with its own browser called Safari.,0
"Safari does offer faster performance, and seemed much more responsive than Internet Explorer.",0
This makes a lot of sense since IE was built for the PC and Safari was built for the Mac.,0
"After using both, I actually preferred Safari, primarily because it offered tabbed browsing - which I had never experienced before.",1
"To explain, when you open a link in Internet Explorer, it will override the existing page, causing you to have to hit the""back"" button to get back where you were.",0
"IE also offers the ability to open the link in a new window, which means you don't override the page you were on previously, but now you have two windows open.",0
"Tabbed browsing simply allows you to open a link on another tab, within the same window.",0
"If you click a link in Safari, it will override the existing page just like IE.",0
"However, if you hold the apple button on the keyboard down when you click a link, it will add a tab at the top of the browser and open the new page associated with the new tab.",0
"You can then click on the different tabs on the top of the browser window to switch between the pages, as well as click on the"" x"" on the tab itself to close the tab.",0
"You can have many tabs open at once, and switching between them is very simple since each tab is labeled with the title of the particular page it is associated with.",0
"Personally, I like the concept of tabbed browsing, which is why I preferred Safari.",0
I also like the performance of Safari over IE.,0
Another hidden gem I found on the Mac post-purchase was the.Mac service from Apple.,0
"At $ 99 a year, it certainly isn't the cheapest hosting/e-mail service around.",0
"However, it is much more than that.",0
"For a novice who wants to put up a web page, and I mean a TRUE NOVICE, there is no better solution.",1
"The.Mac service has pre-formatted web page templates for just about everything, including templates for a homepage, file-sharing, photo albums, movies, writing, resume, baby, education and invitations.",0
"Furthermore, it doesn't allow the user anywhere near any programming code where they can screw anything up.",0
"For example, areas where text can be added only allow the user to put in their own text and move on.",0
"I believe you can make minor changes, such as text color and size, but that's it.",0
Experienced web designers will find the.Mac templates to be far too simple and inflexible.,0
"However, novices will get a big grin on how easy it is and how they can't mess things up.",0
Especially when within 5 minutes ( no lie ) they will have a web page up with photos!,1
"Speaking of photos, the.Mac service seamlessly works with iPhoto in what has to be one of the greatest feats of integration I have ever seen on a personal computer...and it works!",0
Let's say you have taken pictures with your digital camera and imported them into iPhoto.,0
Now you want to put some of those pictures on the website you created through the.Mac service.,0
All you need to do is launch iPhoto and select the photos ( by clicking on them ) you want to put on your website.,0
"Once you select them, you simply click on the""homepage"" icon on the bottom of iPhoto window.",0
"This brings up a window which shows what your web page, complete with the photos, will look like.",0
"It also adds a title of the page, which you can overwrite, as well as an area where you can write a description of the event related to the photos on the page.",0
"After you write whatever you want, you click on a"" theme"" from a number of designs that the.Mac service offers, which are various designs of borders that go around the photo ( such as wood frames, frameless, push pin, etc. ).",0
"Once you select the theme, you hit""publish"", and THAT IS IT!",0
"Not only does it automatically publish the page, but it also adds a link to that photo page on your home page!",1
You can then go back to your homepage in.Mac and edit the text for that link.,0
"Down the road when you want to delete the photo page, you simply login to.Mac and it shows you a list of the pages on your site.",0
"Select the one you want to delete and it not only deletes it, but also gets rid of the link to that page on your homepage.",1
"In other words, you don't need to worry about the impact that changing or eliminating one page has on another page.",0
"In fact, you don't need to know the first thing about designing a website.",0
iPhoto combined with the.Mac service makes it easy for ANYONE to put up their own website.,0
I can't stress enough how easy it is.,0
"Also, it gives you the option of password-protecting the site, which is a nice feature in this day and age.",0
"For instance, I have lots of pictures of my house and family that I wouldn't necessarily want just anyone to see - which is why I did password protect my site.",0
"The.Mac service also offers integration with iMovie for posting movie clips to your site, although I have not investigated that yet.",1
"In addition, you get all sorts of free software and special offers ( that are actually worthwhile ) through.Mac.",0
"The.Mac service also offers all sorts of online training for many applications, such as the iLife applications.",0
"The other"" services"" it offers are e-mail, server space for backup, as well as an interesting way to backup and allow you to access your bookmarks, calendar, contacts and files over the internet.",0
"The.Mac files and folders are available to you on your iMac through a disk called the iDisk ( Apple really loves the letter""i"", especially in lower case )!",0
"The iDisk looks like just another disk on your iMac, but it is actually a virtual disk that is located at Apple on their servers.",0
This is where your website and backup files are located.,0
"iSync automatically synchronizes information such as your calendar, contacts, bookmarks and files between your hard drive and your iDisk and makes them available to you over the internet through any web browser on any computer (PC or Mac ).",0
"iSync also performs various synchronization feats between your iMac and other Macs, as well as with Palm PDA's and bluetooth mobile phones.",0
"Once you get an understanding of how.Mac integrates with your iMac, and all the services it offers, $ 99 seems like a relative bargain.",0
I am very glad I have the.Mac service.,0
I should also note that more experienced website designers can upload their designs to the.Mac web server if they feel the.Mac templates are too simplistic.,0
WARRANTY,0
Apple warranties the iMac for one year.,0
SUPPORT,0
Apple provides complimentary phone support for 90 days from the date of purchase.,0
"Since I was new to the Mac world, I purchased 3 years of support for $ 169 ( called the AppleCare Protection Plan ).",0
"My assumption was that since I was new to the platform, I'd need the support more than the average person.",0
"Well, I haven't called yet!",0
I'm almost hoping I will have a minor issue just to get some sort of payback on my investment!,0
"Actually, the AppleCare Protection Plan also increases the warranty of your hardware an extra 2 years, to make it supported fully for 3 years on both the hardware and phone support.",0
It also includes onsite service versus having to send it - or drive it - back to an Apple authorized service center ( which is the case with the standard 1 year warranty ).,0
COST,0
I don't understand why many people say Apple's are more expensive than PC's.,0
"When I was shopping, I found that the PC's from Dell and Gateway were MORE expensive for a similarly equipped computer.",0
"I paid $ 1799 for my 17"" 1Ghz iMac.",0
"For example, at the writing of this review ( 10/23/03 ), I went to the Dell website to try and price out a PC which was as close to the specs of the 17"" iMac.",0
"Here are the details of the Dell system, which was based on a 2.6 GHz Dimension 4600C, which is their ultra-compact desktop ( which most closely matches the footprint of the iMac ):",0
Dell Dimension 4600C,0
Pentium  4 Processor at 2.60GHz w/800MHz front side bus/ HT Technology,0
Microsoft  Windows  XP Home Edition,0
17 in 1703FP Ultrasharp Digital Flat Panel Display,0

"The Dell system priced out at $ 2,033.",0
"A few hundred dollars more than the 17"" iMac!",0
"Granted, if all you want is a bare bones computer that will get the job done, you can get a much less expensive PC.",0
"However, you get what you pay for.",0
"I believe that the Dell above - with the options listed - most closely matches the iMac, and is more money.",0
SUMMARY,0
I really couldn't be any happier with my purchase of the iMac.,0
It has been the most satisfying consumer electronics purchase I have ever made...period.,0
It is beautiful.,0
It is easy to use.,0
It gets things done quickly.,0
It is fun.,0
What more could I ask for?,0
"For those worried about comparing the specs of the Macs to the PC's, I say get over it and move on.",0
"Once you sit down and use the Mac, you will see that the whole is much more than just the sum of its parts.",0
"You'll forget all about processor speeds, caches and different types of RAM.",0
"Rather, you'll just enjoy the experience of using your computer.",0
"Since Windows is pretty much universal on PC's, PC purchases usually boil down to how much hardware you are getting for your dollar.",0
It is this mentality that causes people to miss out on the beauty of the Mac.,0
The Mac purchase is really about software.,0
"Sure, you have your hardcore Mac fans who spend countless hours debating how fast something will get done on a Mac G4 versus G5.",0
"But for the average consumer who just wants to their computer to work effortlessly, it really comes down to the software.",0
And it is the software that really makes the Mac shine.,0
"Of course, the fact that it looks so nice is an added bonus!",0
This review is a bit long but if you're even slightly interested in switching to the iMac please take the time to read it (you don't want to spend $ 2K on just any old computer do you? ),0
1st of all the individuals who wrote the 1* reviews obviously don't own an iMac and probably own a lot of MS stock so they are Apple bashing.,0
I am in the military and have used PC's since there were PC's.,0
I spent one tour as the IT manager for my command.,0
My only experience w/ Macs had been at my kid's school and with my minister.,0
I was extremely skeptical of Apple and researched for several months before deciding on the iMac.,0
I was tired of having the BBB ( big beige box ) next to my desk.,0
I had seen the new iMac in the news during its intro and was immediately smitten.,0
I ask you why in the yr 2K3 do computers still look like they did 20 years ago?,0
Apple broke the mold with the original iMac and then vaporized it with the new iMac.,0
I've had mine for about one week now and my wife is about ready to divorce me.,0
The engineering and design that went into the iMac make it the most usable computer on the market.,0
Try moving a regular LCD monitor with one finger to position it precisely where you want it.,0
"I can bring the iMac?s monitor right over the keyboard for typing and surfing or put it up high to watch DVD?s with my kids, truly awesome.",0
"The 16X9 aspect ratio is great for everything, especially browsing w/ two windows open, one on each side of the screen.",0
I get so tired of hearing how you can't upgrade it.,0
How many average PC users actually crack a case and upgrade their PC's?,0
Not many I'll wager.,1
"If you're worried about the iMac's 1GHz processor vs a 2.x GHz PC clone, don't.",0
I run a 2.4 GHz at work and I see no difference in everyday apps.,1
I suppose if you're a game freak you'll want a PC but my kids and I play games on consoles now and use the computer for important things like the wonderfully educational and preloaded World Book encyclopedia.,0
If you're really interested read up on how the G4 chip processes in comparison w/ the PC chips.,0
"Set up was a breeze, about 15 mins including unpacking.",0
"The speakers look and sound incredible, and there's no power cord!",1
Do you really need a subwoofer w/ a computer ( more wires )?,0
"I was unsure of the Apple one button mouse but now I'm sure, no carpel tunnel as I move my hand around more the only thing it lacks is a wheel as you can hold the control key and pop up a menu window anywhere (you can add a multi-button mouse if you want ).",1
"I love the"" Dock"" that holds all frequently used program icons, it makes opening an app a delight as each icon blows up when moused over.",0
I have yet to use the super drive for burning DVD's or CD's but it plays/loads them fast and fine.,0
"The iMac is very quiet and just wait until you see it sleeping for the first time, way cool.",0
Lastly if you know your way around MS Windows then don't fear Mac OS.,0
I estimate it took an hour to familiarize myself w/ the important parts of the system.,0
"Go look at the iMac, talk to Mac users, read the switch testimonies and make you choice.",0
Anyone who doesn't give the iMac a test drive and buys a clone will miss a great opportunity to own a truly useful home computer.,0
"I've coveted an iMac ever since a friend's retired mom first got a flat panel 15"" iMac 18 months ago.",0
But I could never justified it.,1
"I'm self-employed, client work is scarcer than a few years ago, and I had two perfectly adequate PCs.",0
"If I wanted a speedy new computer, I could get one from Dell for $ 500, right?",0
"I got a great price on this, and I've never looked back.",1
"I've owned Macs on and off since 1987 ( when I famously paid $ 500 for a 15 meg hard drive ), but about six years ago, while working for a software company, I got fed up with my top of the line $ 5000 PowerBook and its constant crashing and switched to PCs as my main platform.",0
"In the long run, I didn't do this for the operating system but for my eyes.",0
"I spend at least 40 hours a week in front of the computer, mostly online.",0
"An enormous bonus is the audio capabilities, as they have always been with every Mac I've owned.",0
The speakers are great.,0
You plug in a printer ( see my rave review of the Epson 5200 multifunction ) and it just works.,0
The monitor is so crisp I can focus across the room.,0
I love the adjustable arm.,0
The keyboard is perfect.,0
"Took a while to get used to the infrared mouse, and I miss having a second button.",0
The superdrive is just super.,0
"On the downside, the OS doesn't work with the 256 megs of RAM the computer comes with--they should tweak the OS or not sell in this configuration.",1
"I'm running Panther on 768 megs of RAM, and it's really fast.",0
"Hello fellow mac addicts,",0
I'm mainly writing this review for those who may just be curious about the new 1ghz emac or deciding whether it might be for you...,0
I also feel it my karmic duty to post my first impressions because I couldn't find a damn thing on the machine when I was thinking of buying one.,0
"After a lot of a brain-racking over a new machine, the new 1ghz emac with the superdrive seemed to me the best decision in the long run.",0
The superdrive offers great dvd burnability and the machine is an excellent value.,0
I even haggled with the apple phone sales person ( Lisendro ) and was able to get a $ 100 credit in addition to my higher education price and a free canon printer.,0
Let me first start off by saying that apple phone sales rock.,0
""" Lisendro"" was extremely helpful and courteous and the discount just made my day.",0
"Anyway, I ordered my emac and printer last thursday and was impressed at apple's free shipping deal ( fedex ground ) getting the package to my place by monday!! That's an impressive turnaround considering there was no charge.",1
I knew the machine would only come with 256mb of sdram ( not ddr like the imac ) so my next visit was to crucial.com to order some ram.,1
"I snatched up a 512mb chip for 75 bucks ( with coupon code ) and free 2-day air shipping, also.",0
The ram arrived at my house the same day as the computer and printer...,0
nice.,0
"Out of the box, the emac looked fantastic...",0
"mmmm, that refreshing""new mac smell.""",0
"Everything was packed very nicely and well organized, not crammed into one compartment.",1
"Included with the machine is a redesigned keyboard, non-adjustable (unlike like the pro ) and apple has moved the usb ports from the corners to the middle near where the usb cable connects to the machine.",0
One cool/geek design feature of the new keyboard is the lip of plastic surrounding the keyboard.,0
This alone wouldn't be very exciting but after closer inspection I see that each key is suspended and surrounded by sealed plastic.,0
What does this mean to the average joe?,0
"If you knock a glass of soda into your keyboard during your next drunken stuper, not only will the liquid be contained in the keyboard so as not to bleed over your desk and precious electronics but since the keys are suspended upwards, the circuitry will not be affected by the spill.",1
Hard to describe without actually seeing but believe me this is a good thing.,1
"Other stuff that came with the machine: modem cable, blank dvd-r, blank cd-r, user manual and warranty info, back up and restore discs and a copy of the current 2003 WorldBook Encyclopedia Media Cd.",0
No rebate forms for the printer included...,1
I found out later you need to visit apple's website to get them.,0
"After connecting all the cables, I powered up the emac and was pleasantly surprised at the very fast startup time.",0
The 1ghz processor really flies.,0
I'd estimate with the stock ram it only took about 15-20 seconds to startup.,0
"Sure beats staring at the beachball of doom for 4 minutes, doesn't it?",0
"On screen, you are first greeted with some sweet music to help get you through the apple registration process, where you will set up your internet connection.",0
I was offered 12 free issues of MacWorld magazine if I completed apple's registration...,0
why the heck not?? free = smile,0
Upgrading the ram in the emac is painfully simple.,0
"Just turn off the machine, flip it on it's front, unsrew one screw holding the little door on the bottom and your set.",0
One comment about the screw...,0
"I've read a lot about this screw giving people trouble, even stripping so bad they had to farking drill the thing off to remove the door.",0
"I think apple has heard the cries because the new screw is very heavy duty and it's philips-head, not flat-head.",1
"After the ram upgrade, I restarted ( which blazed through in about 5-10 seconds!! ) and checked to make sure the machine had recognized my previous actions.",0
You could already tell she liked the extra memory...,0
"I could almost hear her saying"" thanks brian.""",0
I next decided to check out the speakers.,0
Not too bad but planning on grabing the iSub ( $ 50 ) for a little extra low-end.,1
"Included speakers are good for everyday tasks, but for music there is no contention.",1
"Also, some people have commented on the speakers producing feedback to the moniter at high volumes.",0
This has not happened to me.,1
I have turned them up to full volume and have not witnessed any screen changes.,1
There is a small issue that does arise when turning up the speakers.,0
The plastic surounding the speakers likes to vibrate just a little bit...,0
"a little annoying ( however, with the addition of the tilt and swivel stand, this problem has completely disappeared! ).",0
"Oh, and I've read a lot about the fan on the back of the machine being too loud.",0
"I won't lie to you, it's not as quiet as an imac, but it's not that bad.",1
I'd compare it to a box fan turned on in the corner of your apartment on the lowest setting.,0
You are aware that it's there but you sort of drown it out after a while.,0
I certainly wouldn't let it keep you from buying the machine.,0
Some have talked about the screen flaking out when the resolution is adjusted to the highest setting.,0
This has apparently been fixed because I've tried the monitor on its highest allowable setting ( 1280x 960 at 72Hz ) have experienced no problems.,1
I would have kept it there for the extra screen real estate but the refresh rate is painfully low and I kept getting headaches from looking at it.,0
"I kicked it down to the next highest, which is still very crisp and it's kept me satisfied.",0
"If you plan to compare the crt monitor to the imac's LCD, don't do it.",0
There is no question the LCD of the imac is much crisper and brighter...,1
but CRT's are reliable and much cheaper.,0
"After installing a few software titles like Office X, Photoshop, and Studio MX, the printer was next.",0
"An easy install, the i850 is great for the money.",0
"Unfortunetly, the driver disc included with the printer are for the OS 9 install, so if you are running OS X you'll have to chuck the cd and visit Canon's support website for the updated OS X drivers.",0
Tried it out by printing a few black and white documents and one 4 x 6 photo of my cat ( Leo ) and both came out fast and good quality.,0
The printer even does borderless pics...,0
Leo approved of his pic.,0
Other first impressions of the machine are positive.,0
Its more stream-lined than the average 17-inch crt and is less deep than most.,0
"Apple ditched the removable speaker grills, now permanently fixed; probably a good thing.",0
I bet they're fun to play with for a mischievous kitty.,0
OS X is a great program.,0
Very smooth-running and friendly on the eyes.,0
"For linux-junkies, the""terminal"" is a great place to hang out.",0
iTunes is great for music and syncing with your ipod.,0
"For surfing, don't feel like you need to stick with microsoft's bloated internet browser, IE; Safari and Mozilla are great alternatives and are very stable ( tabbed browsing is the way to go ).",1
"In the end, I'm very happy with the emac and would recommend it to anyone looking for a G4, sweet as heck machine, for right around $ 1000",0
".......... So, I've owned my emac for nearly 5 months now and it still manages to put a smile on my face.",0
"Novelty has worn off a bit, however.",0
"But, this is far from a novelty machine and my feeling is still of complete satisfaction.",0
"Since my initial purchase, I've done more software installation; mainly design titles such as Acrobat, InDesign, and Illustrator.",0
They run very smooth on the G4.,0
"Just an FYI, anyone looking for a decent ftp client, techtv.com",0
"just did a writeup of"" Transmit"" for mac.",0
I've tried it and think it's a great program.,0
"Anyone into webdesign looking for a better ftp alternative, try it.",0
I've also made 2 hardware upgrades.,0
"I ditched the single-button piece of sh** ( sorry apple, it's true ) and indulged in the Logitech MX500 ( $ 50 bucks most retail stores however check ebay to get up to 20 bucks knocked off the retail price ).",0
Not a fan of wireless or the MX700 would have been my first choice ( fantastic for all you wireless junkies ).,0
The MX500 is very nice...,0
great feel and very smooth with ample programmable buttons.,0
Only other hardware indulgence was the emac tilt n' swivel by apple.,0
Holy Schmoly...,0
"this thing is great!! Check out ebay to score one for about 35 bucks, normally $ 69 retail, and let me tell you it makes a HUGE difference with comfort level.",0
"Before I installed the stand, my emac sat about 2-3 inches lower on my desk and was permanetly positioned in a very uncomfortable upwards tilt, producing an incredible amount of glare from the artificial light in my apartment.",0
"After installing not only is the emac up to eye level, but I can tilt the screen down just a hair so it doesn't catch so much glare.",1
It also makes turning the emac easy as pie.,0
Made of a really strong Lexan plastic ( think Nalgene water bottle ) it truely compliments the emac's design.,0
I really can't say enough about the tilt n' swivel...,0
If there was one thing I'm thankful I bought for my computer ( other than the ram upgrade ) it would be this stand.,0
"I'd be lying if I said I didn't, on occasion, still dream about a 17 inch iMac sitting on my desk ( don't tell my emac ) but, the 1799.00",0
sticker price keeps me in check and thankful for my decision to go with the emac instead.,0
Good luck in your decision and I hope this review has helped.,0
"cheers,",0
brian,0
I bought my eMac because I needed a new PC for school/work/play.,0
"My current clamshell iBook; G3, 333 mhZ, 6 GB, 12"", simply was not cussing it anymore in the productivity department.",1
"I did look around at Dell's, Gateway's and HP's only to find that once I added a 17"" monitor, an ethernet card, a gig of RAM, an operating system, MS Office, the prices between the major PC makers and Apple are really out of whack.",0
"Although Apple demands a premium price for their products, you get all the bells and whistles at the time of purchase, thus saving you time and energy trying to incorporate all the add-ons.",0
"In the end, the eMac with all the stuff I need, including Office, was a better deal than a Dell laptop or HP desktop with comparable systems.",0
Apple has certainly created a great product in the eMac.,0
Affordable; up to a 15 % discount for students,0
"Easy to use; was on-line with my cable modem in 5 minutes,",0
Fast; as fast as my 2.3 GHz HP at work.,0
The cd burner works perfectly and the dvd player is a nice option.,0
"The 17"" ( 16"" viewable ) is also very nice to have as well.",0
"As with everything out there, technology is always changing and not everything will be as great as it seems.",1
"In order to have a great experience, you should upgrade to at least 512 MB of RAM ( this applies to all computer systems as well ).",0
This improvement was immediate and worth the 75 bucks.,0
Included with the eMac is a nice suite of software:,0
MacOS X based on UNIX; stable and powerful,0
MacOS 9 for older applications,0
Appleworks 6.2 - comparable to MS Office,0
Safari 1.0 - Apple's new browser based on KHTML,0
Quicken 2003 - a $ 60 dollar value and one great application,0
WorldBook 2003,0
"iTunes - for all your music needs, interfaces with iTunes Muic Store",0
"iPhoto - easily manage all your digital photos, print an album",0
iCal - similar to Outlook Calendar features,0
Quicktime 6.2 - movie player/viewer,0
"and to put all the software to use, there are 5 USB ports and 2 FireWire ports.",0
Limitations:,0
The fan can be a bit noisy ( I used to use only an iBook = no fan; no noise ) so I am still getting used to the fan,1
128 MB of factory RAM - recommend upgrade to 512 MB,0
"This is the only problem that I see, not enough memory out of the box.",1
But memory is cheap and very easy to install; just flip the emac upside down and undo the hatch.,0
No expansion slots,1
Overall the eMac is an exceptional value for the price.,0
"When you take the time to build a comparable PC and finally get to compare features and price, you will see that the eMac is a great buy dollar for dollar.",0
My $ 749 buy price reflects my educational discount.,0
Regular price is $ 999.,0
"bought this computer 12 of august'03 at the apple store in the mall of america, no additional apple care ( i'll buy that before the 1 year warranty expires ) or products to go with it.",1
i got a sweet deal on it with my higher education discount.,0
"the machine was easy to""assemble"" right out of the box, and by default booted into OS X after user setup.",0
"noticing that the default 128mb of ram was insufficient to run many applications simultaneously, i took 2 256 ram modules from my other mac and installed those in the emac.",0
"this was an easy task that does require a philips screwdriver, but that by following the instructions provided in the user manual, even a novice user should be able to perform.",0
"a word of caution however, when purchasing ram, apple has somewhat strict standards, and it is best to purchase ram from a dealer that caters to apple hardware specifically, e.g.",0
crucial.com,0
et cetera.,0
the addition of the new ram signifigantly increased the ability to run several apps simultaneously ( and not bogging down the system ) of the mac.,1
a week later i purchased an airport extreme card to accomodate a new networking scheme in our house.,0
"the card was $ 100 dollars, and was easy to install, once again by following instructions provided by the user manual.",0
"i was disappointed to realize that airport extreme cards are only compatible with OS X, and so that any time i'm using OS 9, i am limited to either an ethernet connection ( or modem ), or using Classic mode under OS X. gaming performance is very satisfactory on this machine, but i'm sure i'm not getting mega-high framerates that 128mb video cards get, but unreal tournament 2003 is very playable at 800x600 and full details set.",1
same with any game based on quake 3 engine.,0
"the speakers are *adequate*, but i choose to have my comptuters hooked up to my home stereo system for a higher fidelity sound.",0
about the monitor...people who are sensitive to refresh rates but want a high resolution will be disappointed.,0
"in OS X, the best combination of resolution is 1280x960 at 72Hz. this is plenty fine for me, but i have known people who get eye strain at looking at anything slower than 80Hz.",0
"the refresh rate goes up to 89Hz at 1024x768, which seems fine to me in OS 9, but things look too silly and large in OS X. the new mouse and keyboard are nice.",0
"one more thing, in sleep mode, the white power indicating light next to the right speaker pulsates, and may be irritating to some people who are sleeping in the same room as there computer, as it does give off quite a bit of light when it pulses bright.",0
i find the pulsating a lot less irritating than fan noise however.,0
The name Apple Computer is synonymous with quality hardware and happy users.,0
Many will be happy to find that the latest high-end system from Apple doesn't break the mold.,1
Hardware Overview,0
The specs are listed for this computer by Epinions so I won't waste space with those.,0
"However, I'll point out some interesting things that are new and/or noteable on this system.",0
The 1.42 ghz system has a better looking hardware package than its 1.25 ghz sibling.,0
This computer's enhancements include:,0
166 megahertz speed increase,0
120 gigabyte hard drive ( 40 gb more than the 1.25 system ),0
512 megabytes of RAM ( 256 mb more than the 1.25 system ),0
2 mb L3 cache *see: http://www.apple.com/powermac/architecture.html*,0
( 1 mb more than the 1.25 system ),0
The following are improvements over the previous generation of Powermacs and are included in all current Powermacs:,0
An optional DVD/CD reader and burner ( Superdrive ).,0
Firewire 800 technology ( an advanced form of the origional firewire interface allows for external devices to be connected to the computer at up to two times the speed of the origional firewire. ),0
Airport Extreme ( the next generation of wireless networking capabilities.,0
"Uses the""g"" technology of wireless interfacing to allow for up to 54 mbps, which is improved from the former 11 mpps. )",0
Experience,0
Truly a joy to use.,0
I've loved this system from the day I opened it up.,0
It comes boxed and packed precisely and carefully.,0
"After I got it up and running, I put my old backed up data onto this system and was running immediately.",0
"I realize that many are unfamiliar with the Apple world, however.",0
"For you, I can say that this system works just like the other Apple systems, just much faster.",0
There aren't any additional hurdles to learning the operating system or specialized hardware.,0
This computer is very quick and accessible to anybody.,0
"The operating system is called"" OSX"".",0
The X is for 10.,0
"Look for reviews for"" OS 10.2: Jaguar"" if you want to read about experiences with the Apple OS.",0
"So far, I've had my computer for about two and a half months.",0
I've had no hardware problems.,1
I've upgraded the RAM and added an Airport Extreme card into the computer.,0
The total time spent on these tasks would be less than 2 minutes.,0
I've been impressed with how intuitive everything is.,0
Performance,0
This is a great computer.,0
The reason it won't recieve a full score is that it doesn't have the speed of the current PC systems.,0
"Motorola, Apple's G4 chip makers, has not put the money into RandD necessary to keep up with Intel and AMD.",1
This is not to say that the Apple system is a pushover.,1
It will finish many tests with a slightly slower score than a PC with over double the megahertz ( 3 ghz Intel systems are now commonplace ).,0
"In some cases, the 1.42 ghz Apple system will outperform the competition.",0
I make these points to illustrate that the gap is not devastating.,1
"I burn CDs at 32x and have the cutting edge wireless technology in Airport Extreme, mentioned earlier.",0
Productivity in all areas is perfectly acceptable.,0
The real draw for this computer is the operating system.,0
OSX is revolutionary and addictive.,0
"If it would run on any other system, I'm sure Apple wouldn't sell many 1.42 ghz systems because people would buy the best hardware and the best software.",0
"That not being possible, I'd rather take the best software and mid-line hardware.",1
I absolutely love the OS so slightly slower test scores could not dissuade me from purchasing this computer.,1
Conclusion,0
My recommendation to everybody is to try out Apple's OSX.,0
"If you like it, then this computer is more than worth your money.",0
"If you don't, then I don't see any reason to get this system.",1
"It's a bit slower than the competition, after all.",0
"Either way, I and many other Apple users will be having a great time with our computers.",0
Final Note,0
Those interested should wait until June 27th to find out if Apple releases their newest systems then.,0
Keep an eye out at Apple's website ( Apple.com ),0
or other sites to know when your dollars will be best spent.,0
"Fortunately for me, I was in the midst of contemplating my upcoming new computer purchase when the recent Mac Expo was in session.",0
I had just donated my slooooow Performa 6200 to my son's kindergarten classroom and somehow convinced my husband that we needed a new computer.,0
( Note that we already have a perfectly good blue and white G3 and an iMac DV+. ) It's a testament to his devotion to me that didn't question ( too much ) my insistence on a new computer.,0
The big struggle for me was to decide which computer to buy.,0
I've lusted after laptops for ages and really had my sights set on an iBook or Powerbook but the truth is that you just don't get the same bang for your buck with a laptop.,0
"I also drooled over the G4 dual processors but, yikes, the cost was a bit too prohibitive for me.",0
Of course I considered another iMac ( my husband was lobbying heavily for this ) but I just felt like I wanted more.,0
"and then I saw it, the brand new, ultra sleek Flat Panel G4 iMac.",0
It was lust at first sight.,0
"When I told others that I had ordered a flat panel iMac, I got a mix of reactions.",0
Some were understandably envious and jealous.,0
"However, a small minority looked at me like I had lost my mind.",0
""" Why would you buy that freaky looking computer?""",0
""" It can't possibly hold up to everyday use."""" It's going to be a bust, just like the Cube.""",1
Harrumph!,0
"I ignored their taunts, secretly hoping that they weren't right.",0
"Unfortunately, I had to wait almost a month for the computer to ship so that gave me plenty of time to second guess the wisdom of my choice.",0
The Unveiling and Set Up,0
The big day finally came when my new baby arrived from Airborne Express.,0
I impatiently elbowed my kids and husband out of the way so I could be the first one to see this masterpiece.,0
I checked my watch before I opened the box.,0
It took me just under 9 minutes from cutting the tape on the box to having the computer up and running.,0
That includes the time that I took to drool lovingly over each component as I removed it from the box.,0
"I cant brag about how quickly I got on to the internet, though, since my darling husband has not yet installed the Ethernet wire I bought to connect to our new router.",1
"Needless to say, the set-up was incredibly easy and took no instructions whatsoever ( though clear visual diagrams are available for the less confident ).",1
The software is already pre-loaded and ready to go.,0
How does the New iMac Different Compare to the Previous Version?,0
"In comparing the two computers, I will be referring to the more recent iMac models, not the original fruit colored ones with the hockey puck mouse.",1
"Also, be aware that even though I am an avid and devoted Mac fan, I'm not a techno-geek.",1
"Therefore, my comparison of these iMacs will be limited to the features that I can sort of understand.",0
Don't sue me if I leave something out - just leave me a comment about my omissions and/or errors ( preferably a kind and supportive comment ).,0
"Although first glance suggests that the new iMac is vastly different than its predecessor, there are a few basic similarities:",0
~ ~ All in one package: The beauty and simplicity of having everything you need in one integrated unit was a major selling point for the first iMacs and it continues to be a significant advantage of the new generation of iMacs.,0
~ ~ Mouse and keyboard: Both of these input peripherals are identical on my two iMacs - the Apple Pro Optical mouse and the full size Apple Pro keyboard.,0
Both are significant improvements over the cheesy undersized mouse and keyboard that shipped with the original iMacs ( and my G3 ).,0
"Actually, there is one notable difference with this iMac  both the keyboard and the optical mouse are snowy white, just like the computer itself.",0
The white keys are an improvement over the black keys on my other iMac keyboard because theyre much easier to see in the dark.,0
"~ ~ Minimal Expandability: There are not many options for expanding either iMac model, though the need for expansion seems less of an issue with the feature-packed new iMac.",1
Both have one available slot for memory ( which Ive already filled on both computers ) and the option of installing an Airport card.,0
Now for the differences - some striking and some more subtle:,0
"~ ~ Size and shape: As you can see from the photo, the new iMac is a unique-looking computer.",0
"Personally, I think it's elegant but then I did buy it so I suppose I'm biased.",0
"Rather than looking like a large CRT monitor ( like the old iMac ), the new one looks like a soccer ball ( except closer in size to a basketball ) cut in half with a slender flat screen literally floating in space.",0
"The new iMac only has a 10.6 inch footprint so even with the two speakers, keyboard, and mouse, I have tons more room on my computer desk to clutter up with other gadgets.",0
"~ ~ Monitor: Instead of the 15-inch CRT on the older iMac, the new iMac has a brilliant flat-panel 15-inch display which provides almost the same viewable area as most 17-inch CRT monitors, but with twice the sharpness, brightness, and contrast.",0
The screen is bordered in white and then further edged with clear plastic.,0
"Therefore, there is ample space to grab a hold of the screen and move it without actually putting your fingers on the viewable screen itself.",0
~ ~ Speakers: This high-end iMac also ships with two 9-watt round external Apple Pro Speakers.,0
The earlier iMacs are all limited to internal speakers that provide a much more limited audio experience.,0
The Apple Pro Speakers look like softball-sized clear eyeballs.,0
"The sound quality is impressive, but then I haven't cranked them up to listen to any music yet.",0
"~ ~ Hard Drive: Though hard drive size is not a huge issue for many people, I really appreciate the 60GB Ultra ATA hard disk drive on the new iMac ( as opposed to 20GB on my older iMac ).",1
All it took was a little digital video-editing project to max out my old iMac's hard drive space.,0
"~ ~ Processor: Instead of the 450-MHz G3 in my first iMac, the newer iMac comes with the 800-MHz PowerPC G4 with Velocity Engine.",0
"This allows it to process data in larger chunks ( 128-bit ), in comparison to the smaller chunks used in earlier processors.",0
"What this means is that the newer iMac can easily handle the data-intensive processing required by digital video, music, graphics applications and 3D games.",0
It also comes with a NVIDIA GeForce2 MX graphics processor with 32MB of dedicated Double Data rate video memory that gives a major boost to 3D graphics.,0
"~ ~ Removable Media Drive: My old iMac was considered cutting edge ( OK, well not really ), because it came with a DVD player.",1
"Though the removable media drives that ship with the new iMacs differ from model to model, this one is the top of the line - the SuperDrive.",0
The SuperDrive is a DVD burner as well as a DVD player and CD-RW.,0
The new iMacs drive is also a tray drive as opposed to the slot drive on my older iMac.,0
It fits flush to the round computer base and is almost invisible.,0
You can open and close the drive with the media eject key ( far upper right on keyboard ).,0
"According to Apple, the SuperDrive""writes DVD-R discs at 2x speed, reads DVDs at 6x speed, writes CD-R discs at 8x speed, writes CD-RW discs at 4x speed, reads CDs at 24x speed.""",0
I haven't timed it yet so I'll have to take their word for it.,0
"~ ~ More USB ports: The new iMacs have one extra USB port than the earlier iMacs, making a total of 5 USB ports ( counting the two on the Apple Pro keyboard ).",0
"I appreciate the extra port, though I suspect I'll still need a hub at some point.",0
~ ~ Operating System: My first iMac was one of the last machines that shipped without OS X.,1
The new one comes with two operating systems: OS X and OS 9.2,0
"~ ~ Digital Hub Goodies and Other Software: Both iMacs came with good software packages but the new iMac has the newer iTunes2, iMovie2, iPhoto, and iDVD2.",0
"Other software shipped on the new iMac includes the latest QuickTime, AppleWorks 6, Mail, Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Quicken 2002 Deluxe, World Book Mac OS X Edition, Otto Matic, Mac OS X Chess, PCalc, Acrobat Reader and FAXstf 10.0 Preview.",0
"I have nt checked it all out, though I have had a blast with the World Book ( encyclopedia, dictionary, atlas, and more ).",0
"~ ~ Other Features ( not necessarily unique to this iMac ): The G4 iMac comes with 256 RAM ( I added another 256 immediately ), a built-in 56K V.90 fax modem, built-in 10/100BASE-T Ethernet ( takes RJ-45 connector ), two 400-Mbps FireWire ports, built-in antennas and a card slot for an optional 11-Mbps AirPort Card.",1
Adding additional memory and an airport card is a simple process of unscrewing the base plate.,0
"However, I had my extra memory installed free from MacConnection so I didn't need to do this.",0
You can find out more technical details by checking out Apple's web site:,0
http://www.apple.com/imac/specs.html,0
"Enough of the Dry Details, Tell Us About the Intangible iMac Experience!",0
I must admit  I love the all white look.,0
Its downright virginal!,0
"Dont let appearances fool you, though.",0
"Besides looking gorgeous, sitting on my desk, this G4 iMac screams in terms of speed!",0
The flat screen is crystal clear and sharp with all pixels live and accounted for.,0
It's going to be hard to switch back and forth between this and my older CRT.,0
"The screen moves effortlessly up and down, forward and back, while maintaining the same angle.",0
I was a bit apprehensive about the strength of the chrome arm but after handling it a bit I can see that s more than tough enough.,0
"In fact, you lift the computer by the arm when you want to move it.",0
The video quality in this computer is first rate.,0
"Ive watched several DVDs on this without any problem, though I have nt yet burned one.",1
"There is a distinct hum to the computer ( probably a cooling fan ), though it s still quieter than my older iMac.",0
The tray drive itself is rather loud opening and closing so I guess it could disturb someone sleeping in the room ( a potential issue for me since the computer is in our bedroom ).,0
One of my biggest concerns in getting the new computer was dealing with OSX.,0
"Though Ive been quite curious about this new operating system, Ive also been understandably nervous in having it on my new computer since virtually all of my applications ( except the ones that came pre-installed ) are not OSX compatible.",1
"Fortunately, it also ships with OS 9.2 so I assumed I would make that my default operating system  if I could figure out how.",0
Some people I know are so paranoid about OSX that they uninstalled it completely.,0
"Fortunately, I not only discovered that it s quite simple to switch default operating systems, I also was delighted to learn that the"" classic"" environment ( OS 9 ) kicked in automatically whenever I tried to us one of my earlier applications.",1
"For example, I installed my Microsoft Office 98 without switching operating systems and it works just fine  in fact Im typing in it right now.",1
It takes a few seconds for the classic environment to open but then everything seems to work perfectly ( so far ).,0
The ease of dealing with the operating system question has definitely added to the pleasure of using this new iMac.,0
One thing that s taking awhile to get use to is the location of the power button.,0
Its on the back of the computer on the left side.,0
You cant see it so you have to feel around for it.,0
"Its actually not hard to reach since the computer itself is so petite but it sure confuses people who are unfamiliar with the G4 iMac ("" How do you turn this thing on?"" ).",1
I still miss the power button on the keyboard ( on my Blue and White G3 ).,0
Practical Considerations with the G4 iMac,0
"Though I'm thrilled with my new purchase, I do have some doubts about the practicality of this model in certain situations.",0
"For example, I don't think this iMac will ever take off as a computer of choice in the public schools ( a haven for the original iMac ).",1
The flat screen is just too delicate for the kind of handling that curious and impulsive kids provide.,0
"In fact, I have my concerns about my own kids and the flat screen.",0
"Originally, I envisioned this computer serving as the""family computer"" where I could write Epinions, my husband could surf the net, and our young children could play games.",0
"For now, I've banned my kids from even coming within 5 feet of this baby, though I know I won't be able to enforce the"" no kid zone"" for long.",1
"My six-year-old is already talking about what games he wants to load on to"" Mamas new computer.""",0
Dr_Steph's Recommendation,0
"The 800MHz Flat Screen G4 iMac is everything I want in a computer - fast, reliable, powerful, compact, beautiful, and downright fun.",0
"It has the features to delight the experienced computer whiz, yet is simple enough for the novice to enjoy.",0
"In case you couldn't tell yet, I love my new computer.",0
You can laugh all you want - I know you're just jealous.,0
The Beginning...,0
Apple snagged me as a prospective customer in January of 2001 after a series of problems with my Gateway desktop.,0
I was in the market for a laptop for school and decided to try the local Apple reseller in town.,0
The technicians were knowledgeable and friendly the the price was right.,0
"However, I found that I could customize my own iBook through www.apple.com,",0
and shipping was free.,0
The chance to avoid the pressure of salesmen was attractive and so I quickly placed my order.,0
A week later I received my new Keylime iBook and promptly fell in love it.,0
A year later...,0
A year had passed and my Gateway desktop was still giving me the same problems it had been giving me since I had purchased it.,0
"However, I had learned to live with the problems as it had been a gift from my parents.",0
That was until I found out that Apple had released photos of it's upcoming Flat Panel iMac.,0
"I immediately fell in love all over again and experienced the urge to own one ASAP ( part of the compulsive shopper speaking out in me, part of me knew it would make my digital lifestyle a heckuva lot easier ).",0
I once again placed a customized order through www.apple.com,0
"for the top of the line model: 800 MHZ G4 Superdrive with DVD/CD RW capabilities, 60 GB of memory, and I bumped the RAM from 256 to 512 MB.",0
"Some may argue that the DVD-RW may not be necessary, but I wanted to keep my options open just in case I purchase a digital camcorder in the future.",1
"Ground shipping, as always, was free.",0
All together my purchase came close to $ 1900.,0
"You could also choose from a 700 mhz model that had a CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive ( as opposed to the DVD-RW drive with the 800 mhz ), or an even cheaper 700 mhz model that had just a CD-RW drive.",0
They were around $ 1600 and $ 1400 respectively.,0
( **NOTE: Prices since have gone up about $ 100 a computer since my purchase due to rising costs of quality parts.,0
Worth it in my opinion. ),0
"I was able to finance the computer through MBNA, which provides an easy loan application through the Apple website.",0
I placed the order in the middle of January with the promise of it being delivered in 3-5 weeks.,0
I settled in for the long wait.,0
The Verdict...,0
"Five weeks to the day later, I received an e-mail from Apple stating that it would be delayed an additional 7 days.",0
"At this point, I was so used to waiting that the message didn't phase me.",1
"However, I was surprised when I received an e-mail two days later saying it had been shipped.",0
Five days later and it was on my doorstep.,0
"First off, Apple knows how to deliver.",0
"It was in a perfectly square box that had a picture of the iMac on one side, and an Apple logo on the other.",0
I cut through the top of the box and was greeted by a heavy-weight poster of the new iMac in various positions.,0
Do I dare say it looked like it was dancing?,0
At this point I couldn't wait.,1
"I removed the poster and styrofoam that contained the keyboard, and the styrofoam that surrounded the computer.",0
Set-up was a snap.,0
"I lifted the computer out making sure to grip the""arm"" with one hand and the base with the other and placed it onto the table.",0
I connected one end of the plug into the computer and the other into the wall.,0
"Then, I connected the keyboard and speakers.",0
"Finally, I connected the mouse.",0
I was frustrated at the amount of USB slots that were taken up until I realized that the mouse is meant to be plugged into the keyboard ( which contains two USB slots at the top ).,0
Whoops.,0
"Nevermind being frustrated, I was now impressed!",0
"Apple supplied their customers with a total of five USB slots on this beauty, along with two firewire slots.",0
More than enough.,0
"I fired up my new beauty by pushing the""power button"" located on the left side of the base and was greeted by OS X.",0
It looked absolutely amazing on the 15 inch LCD monitor.,0
OS X was automatically programmed to get me setup as a new user and onto the internet in the fastest way possible.,0
"I already had a user account through Earthlink and I had no problems setting it up, but Apple also gave the option to set up a new account.",1
Ten minutes later I was surfing the internet with my new iMac.,0
Apple also supplies their users with accounts for iTools.,0
This account gives you access to an e-mail address ( mine is xxskagirlxx@mac.com ),0
and additional access to community features online.,0
"I was able to immediately access my""mac mail"" through the mail program in OS X ( when connected to the internet ) but I also wanted to access my Earthlink mail account.",0
Setting up the mail program to retrieve my Earthlink mail was a piece of cake!,0
"All I needed to do was fill out my domain, username and password.",0
I can now retrieve both mail accounts from my Apple.,0
After a bit I decided to install a game.,0
"Once again, installation was flawless and the game ( The Sims, a memory hog ) ran great.",0
"The computer also came with iTunes, iMovie and iDVD.",0
I tried iTunes out right away and was impressed the the simplicity of the program.,0
The music that was preloaded into the program sounded wonderful through the Apple Pro Speakers that came with the system.,0
I'm looking forward to starting a new MP3 collection.,0
"I'm also looking forward to using iMovie and iDVD in conjunction with a digital camcorder, when I get around to purchasing one.",0
I need to win the lottery first.,0
"I've also gotten a lot of use out of iPhoto, Apple's digital photo editing software.",0
I own an Olympus digital camera and I love to download my photos to edit them.,0
"However, I've always had such a tough time keeping track of the photos once they were saved to my computer.",0
iPhoto eliminatated this problem.,0
"The program saves each set of pictures you download as a""roll"" of film to be accessed later.",0
"The pictures can be left in the""rolls"" or I can reorganize them as I wish.",0
I can also organize the photos into slide shows with one click of a button.,0
It's very simple to use.,0
Apple has a reputation for being different and making software that is easy for the average consumer to use.,0
They easily live up to their name with this computer.,0
"Not only is the G4 Superdrive ultra fast (arguably faster than my Gateway Athlon ), it's quieter than a mouse.",1
"Surprisingly, the base doesn't get hot as one would think, meaning Apple has done a superb job of designing the CPU.",1
"The screen, of course, is a genius idea.",0
I can pull it closer when I want to read a website.,0
I could push it back when I want to play a game.,0
All it takes is a little push with one finger and it hovers to where I want it to go.,0
I can also push it up or down if my neck is getting strained.,0
"The lack of space the computer takes up is definately a plus as it isn't intimidating as other, bulkier computers.",1
"And, the software is a snap to use.",0
I haven't had any freeze-ups or hardware problem yet.,1
I look forward to using this computer for all my digital needs for years to come.,0

I would also highly recommend checking out www.apple.com.,0
"They have a lot of information concerning their newest iMac, including a Gallery that allows you to take a closer look",0
"I've been a"" Mac girl"" ever since the introduction of the Classic and I must say that this is one of the best computers I've ever owned.",0
"Many of the other Apple computers and components I've owned have been plagued with problems, yet after 6 months this one has been virtually problem-free.",0
"Although I had just purchased a Snow iMac in late 2000, once I saw the ad for the Flat Panel iMac I knew this was the computer for me.",0
The original iMac and iMovie for OS 9 had got me hooked on editing home movies and I was drooling over the built in DVD-R in the new model.... I had to have it.,0
Getting the computer was the only major problem I've had due to a release date that Apple couldn't meet.,0
"Once I ordered the system it took months to come in because they weren't shipping, but I believe those problems are gone now.",0
"When the computer arrived, the flat panel screen was cocked and the fix was too difficult to complete alone as it required opening the flat panel screen.",0
Apple tech support was very understanding of the problem and quickly set up a case for me and it was fixed at a local shop within a week.,0
"I was a little nervous about switching operating systems since everything I used was on OS 9, but the learning curve isn't steep.",0
"OS X is very sleek and much more user friendly and stable than OS 9, and for the few programs that you can't get on OS X, it even runs OS 9 in the background if you want!",0
OS X comes with all the tools you need ( except the video camera ) for making professional looking DVD's of whatever you want.,0
"In 6 months I have already attended an event, video taped it, then edited it with iMovie and sold 80 copies of the DVD's I burned with my new system.",0
At $ 22 a piece it has almost paid for itself!,0
"Unlike Apple's previous attempts at stylish computers, they did not sacrifice function for fashion in this model.",1
"Not only is it ingeniously"" cute,"" it also runs extremely cool ( no burning hot CD's coming out of THIS drive ).",1
It is the quietest computer I've ever owned as well.,0
"The flat panel is beautiful and although I've seen others complain of dead pixels, I don't have any yet.",0
"( I also believe this is just the""nature of the beast"" with flat panel monitors ) The screen pivoting feature is wonderful in a room where I am constantly showing my work to people around me.",0
It will run even the most graphic intensive game and multi-task like a champ.,0
"I'm disappointed that they are now coming out with a 17"" model, as I would have waited for this had I known.",0
"I know I know, you never know with computers and whatever you buy is typically outdated within 6 months anyways, but with this machine I went by past experience with iMacs always being 15 inches.",1
"I figured if they hadn't come out with a 17"" at this point that they redesigned the whole machine, they never would lol.",1
The only complaint I have is really just with Apple's policies.,0
I just got this machine in February and they've already come out with a new operating system that I'm required to pay *full price* for in order to upgrade.,0
"This is ridiculous, to me they should at least offer a little cheaper version if you already own the operating system.",0
"I am also a little"" torqued"" that they are charging for iTools.",0
"Not because I think it's not worth it ( well, worth $ 100 a year?",1
"I dunno... ) but because they had always""promised"" that at the very least the email would continue to be free.",0
"At this point, they aren't even offering different levels of iTools ( like mail only $ 20/year, mail +website $ 40/year, etc ) you just have to pay $ 100 or not get it.",1
But for years the free iTools has been one of their strongest selling points and they advertise it on every machine.,0
"For a company that relies heavily on word of mouth advertising from Mac to PC users, I would think that it wouldn't want to reduce it's loyal customer base by making them feel slighted.",0
The first thing you notice about the P25 S507 is the huge screen.,0
"At 17 inches, it is probably as big as you can get while still being""portable.""",0
"After you get past just the size of the screen, you will find a fairly potent laptop.",0
Although I say laptop very loosely as you will see.,0
First off the specs:,0
Desktop: Pentium 4 with Hyper threading 2.8 GHZ,0
Screen: 17 inches,0
Weight: about 10 lbs,0
Storage: 60 gigs hard drive,0
"DVD: DVD R/RW, yes you can write DVD!!!",0
Internet: Ethernet and integrated wireless adapter,0
Connectivity: 4 USB2 ports and an IEE Port,0
RAM: 512 mb,0
Video: GeforceGo 5200fx 32 mg VRAM,0
"Battery Life: About 2 hours, roughly 1 1/2 with heavy use.",0
Operating system: Windows XP,0
Impressions: The extra wide screen size and ability to burn your own DVD's lends this laptop to be consider an extremely good movable movie theater.,0
"It has really good sound, with two stereo Harmon/Karmon speakers.",0
"The screen is pretty clear and crisp, so movies and pictures are pretty good.",0
"Though not quite as good as a HDTV, but not too bad either.",1
"I'm a pretty big movie buff, so the ability to watch my favorites movies anywhere is a big factor for me.",0
"Plus with the extra wide screen format, it lends itself perfectly for movies.",0
Preloaded programs also makes it quite versatile.,0
I found the Quicken program the most useful as I can balance my finances.,0
"I especially like the integrated wireless modem, since I have a wireless network at home.",0
"Connecting to the internet was quite easy, and did not require a lot of tinkering.",1
"Though lots of web pages are not made in the extra wide format so, there will be wasted space on your screen.",1
"Playing games on this machine is great, the high specs on the machine allows me to play a game like FreeLancer at good frame rates.",0
The game actually is in wide format so I get the see more of the game than a regular laptop.,0
"You will have to buy an external mouse, since the touch pad is not really made for games.",1
"I have not try it yet with a graphics intensive game, but when Doom3 or Half2 comes out, I'll let you know.",1
"I have not been able to find a program to uses the hyper-threading aspect of the CPU, so I can not give any impressions on that.",1
Drawbacks:,0
"While this is consider a laptop, I really think of it more as an movable movie theater.",0
Why?,0
"Well, at 10 lbs it is pretty heavy thing to lug around.",0
"Plus, with the extra wide screen, you can not fit it in an average laptop bag.",1
The size of the laptop itself makes it harder to move from place to place.,0
"You can probably movie it from room to room or from house to house, but I would not recommend using it in where your lap is your only option.",1
This laptop requires a desk.,0
"If you do want to bring this laptop, you will find it hard to find a bag that will fit a 17 inch screen.",0
"I've found one, but it barely fit and requires some squeezing.",0
Bottom line.,0
"Great for movies, not so great for your lap.",1
Let me just start off with a little background about me before I get into the review.,0
"I've been involved in PC's for about 10 years now in various capacities, from PC tech to Network Administrator.",0
"So, I've seen many different PC's come across my desk.",0
I also do consulting/PC sales and Repair on the side and prefer to build my own PC's whenever possible (you get the best value that way ).,0
"Now, on to the review:",0
Back in 99 we got a digital camcorder as a wedding and Christmas present and I was so excited - we could edit our home movies on our computer and do all sorts of neat titles and such!,0
"Well, after $ 150 for the FireWire card and 2 PC's later, I was never able to get it to work well.",1
"The software was buggy, the card manufacuturer claimed my PC's chipsets were bad as I was never able to get the finished product back to tape, etc.",1
I gave up in'00 on video editing.,0
"Then in 2001, I picked up a new digital camera.",0
"Since photography has been one of my hobbies for years, it only seemed natural to try out a good digital camera.",0
"Along the way, it seemed as if our current PC just wasn't cutting it.",1
with digital photos....,0
"I had always heard Macs were the best for photo and video, but I never was really drawn to them - the iMacs were ugly ( sorry ), and the towers were EXPENSIVE.",1
"Besides, who uses a Mac anyway?",0
Then in February I saw an ad for the new iMac.,0
I fell in love!,0
"This was what I was looking for, a fast computer with all the bells and whistles!",0
"After showing it to the wife, along with the comments about""why are you getting a Mac?"" and"" Are you crazy?"" and"" It's so UGLY!"".",0
I just knew this had to be the computer for me.,0
We took a trip to the Tyson's Corner Apple store one Sunday to check it out and make sure it was for me.,0
"Arriving there, it was an awesome experience - you could play to your hearts content and really experience the hardware.",0
Definitely worth the trip.,0
"I was sold immediately - iPhoto was just what I needed to organize my photos, iTunes was the BEST MP3 player, iMovie was what PC editing should have been.",0
"Unfortunately, I had to wait about a month for the money to come in before I could even think about the iMac again.",0
"Then, once the money was in I called up local Mac dealers - none of which had them in stock, then the Tyson's Corner store....Nothing, then the Clarendon store - they had 1 left and would only hold it for me until the end of the day...",1
"So, at 5pm I left on a 2 hour journey...Got there around 7:30 and was out the door with my ner toy by 8pm, home by 10:30.... I think the salesperson was in shock when he learned I was from 2 hours away to pick up the computer.",0
"Out of Box Experience - Apple has, hands down the best.",0
"Opening up the box, you saw a cardboard poster with unpacking instructions.",0
Everything was precisely placed and laid out very well.,0
"Initial Setup - Again, flick the power switch and in 10 minutes you were off and running.",0
Just answer a few simple questions and you are all setup.,0
Performance - Performance is great.,0
"OSX really needs more memory than the standard 256MB ( so does WinXP), expecially since I love to multitask - I'm one of those people that have 10 things running at a time!",0
Display - THE BEST!,0
I have a work issue IBM laptop and the iMac is the best.,0
"Big ( as big as a 17"" monitor ), bright, and beautiful.",0
"What more can I say - everything looks gorgeous, from my Pictures to text!",0
Stability - I'm a stickler for stability.,0
I've never managed to coax more than 10 days of uptime out of any of my Windows boxes ( except my Win2k server ) that are in daily use.,1
With the Mac and OSX I regularly get 20+ days of uptime before I need to reboot.,0
It just runs and runs and runs.,0
"No""reboot to fix this"" or any stuff like that - it just chugs away.",1
Software - What can I say - this thing is truly the digital hub.,0
I've made more movies and DVD's with it in the past 4 months than I have with my PC's in 10 years.,0
It's so easy and just works.,0
"Recently, my wife and I completed a DVD and VHS tape for her brother's wedding and the results are better than the PROFESSIONAL we hired to do ours!",0
"MP3's rock in iTunes, iPhoto is a great way to organize your photos....",0
Compatibility- All my files and hardware work with it.,0
"I made the transition to all USB devices ( printer, scanner, memory card reader, etc. ) a while ago and they are all Plug-and-Play with the Mac!",0
Complaints,0
These are small:,0
*/SYM Re-learning a new OS.,0
"Being a Windows guy, learning OSX has taken some time.",0
"In the first couple days I wanted to return the machine, I was so frustrated with it.",0
"But after""forgetting"" my Windows stuff Mac OS was/is so intuitive.",0
*/SYM Scanning in OSX is a disaster.,0
"For some reason, few scanner manufacturers support OSX. Epson ( whose scanner I love ) has beta software that works well, but it could be a lot better.",0
*/SYM Printer support.,0
"Again, I use Epson.",0
"Their drivers are OK, but lack some of the features of the"" Classic"" versions ( or even the Windows versions.",0
I hear the new version of OSX will fix this.,0
*/SYM Networking with Windows.,0
"You can connect to file shares on a Windows network, but cannot use printers or share files from your Mac on the Windows network ( without installing AppleTalk support on the PC ).",1
"When you do connect, the Mac has a nasty habit of leaving weird files on the server (.DsStore and a couple others ) I hear the new version of OSX will fix that as well.",0
"All in all, it's the best computer that I've ever used.",0
"Fast, stable, and IT JUST WORKS!!!",0
I have spent three months with my new Sony Vaio PCG-FRV27 notebook computer and must say that I am impressed.,0
"Our company had been using a four year old Sony that just did not cut it; too slow, too heavy, too old.",1
"After a couple of years of haggling, we finally convinced the bosses that we really did need a better laptop.",0
"Thankfully, they saw that we might be on to something and managed to free up enough money so that we could make a purchase.",0
The differences between the three or four year old Sony laptop that I had been using and the Sony VAIO PCG-FRV27 Notebook are simply amazing.,0
"Suddenly, I am not hesitant to pull out my laptop in front of clients ( Improved graphics, speed, mouse, etc. ) because of the ineptitude of my previous computer.",1
"Heck, the improvements are a huge step up from my desktop of two years.",0
"Regardless, here is what I like and do not like when it comes to the Sony VAIO PCG-FRV27 Notebook.",1
THE SPECIFICS:,0
*/SYM 2.66 GHz Intel Pentium 4 processor,0
*/SYM 512 MB RAM,0
*/SYM 533 system BUS speed,0
*/SYM DDR SDRAM,0
*/SYM 1.024 MB maximum RAM,0
*/SYM Windows XP home operating system,0
*/SYM One 40 GB hard drive,0
"*/SYM CD-RW 24x ( read ), 16x ( write ), 8x ( rewrite )",0

*/SYM Warranty for parts and labor of one year,0
"Ok, so what does all this provide you with?",0
How do you make sense of this?,0
"Well, if you are me, you don't.",0
"I will provide you with what I like and do not like, but this will not be a highly technical epinion.",1
I simply do not understand a lot of the technical stuff.,1
What I do understand is performance and what is important to the everyday end user.,0
WHAT I LIKE:,0
The size is much better than what I was accustomed to.,0
"I know it seems odd that I would list this first, but when you are traveling frequently the size of your machine is important.",0
"The smaller and lighter the better, so long as you are not sacrificing performance.",1
The Vaio PCG- FRV27 Notebook is quite light and a similar size to what all other notebooks are.,0
A great improvement over what you could purchase a few years ago.,0
2. Speed.,0
"No, the Vaio is not as fast as my desktop computer, but yes it is fast.",1
I am able to download as fast as I can on any computer in our office.,0
This is of utmost importance to me when I am traveling since I am constantly downloading large files that contains numerous graphics for various presentations.,0
I am also able to download videos that go along with the presentations without delay.,1
Both are great upgrades over my previous laptop.,0
3. The graphics are sharp and professional.,0
"Again, this is important when it comes to any presentation.",0
I must have a computer that can produce colorful and sharp graphics in order to look professional.,0
The graphics must also be sharp when shown through the lens of a projector.,0
The Vaio PCG- FRV27 Notebook meets both of these criteria without a problem.,1
"In addition, the screen is larger than my old machine because the screen takes up most of the frame that you view.",0
What I mean is that there is not really much of a frame around the picture.,1
"Hence, the picture portion of the screen is larger.",0
4. Options are important.,0
What do I mean?,0
I mean multiple ports.,0
"At any one time, for instance, I may need to be hooked to a printer, projector, and the internet.",0
In order to do so I need multiple ports.,0
This machine provides me with three USB ports and two pc card slots.,0
What this means is that I can be hooked into multiple accessories at the same time.,0
"With my old machine, I had to often disconnect from one accessory in order to hook another one up.",0
5. The bundled software is useful.,0
"This software includes the following: Microsoft Money 2003, Microsoft Works 7.0, Intervideo WinDVD 4 for VAIO PC, Microsoft Encarta Online, Sony DVgate Plus, Sony SonicStage, Sony PictureGear Studio, Sony VAIO Media Software, Sony Click to DVD, EasySystem Drag'n Drop CD+DVD.",0
"While not all these names are familiar to me, I am sure that some of them are used without my knowledge.",1
I do spend a good bit of time using Microsoft Money 2003 for my personal financial computations and budgets.,0
I also frequently utilize Microsoft Works in order to import and export charts for presentations and to develop reports for clients.,0
A number of the bundled software programs are used for digital images - whether it be processing or editing.,0
"Regardless of whether or not you utilize many or any of these software programs, it is best to have them available.",1
The touch pad mouse is easier to use than most.,0
"I have never been a fan of the touch pad mouse, but am becoming a fan of this mouse.",1
Most have always been difficult for me to use because they would always move too quickly or have too much lag.,0
I also found that I struggled in getting them to go where I wanted them to go.,0
Not so with this mouse.,1
The touch pad is easy to operate and works like it should.,0
You will find a consistent speed and pinpoint control.,0
"7. Though I infrequently utilize the sound feature, it is decent enough.",0
The speakers are built in ( Obviously ) and provide a sound that I would not be embarrassed to utilize in a presentation.,1
"Again, this is a big step up from a few years ago.",0
WHAT I DO NOT LIKE:,1
The battery is just mediocre.,0
I say this with a caveat; I may be using more battery draining operations than before since I can.,0
"However, I would have liked to see Sony utilize a better battery.",0
"Utilizng a couple of accessories, I can go for a good four to six hours without problems.",1
Anything over six hours and the battery begins to die out in a hurry.,0
2. Customer service is nothing special.,0
"Ok, this is nothing new.",0
It seems as though customer service is poor regardless of which company you are talking about when it comes to technology.,0
I was disappointed when I had to wait for 30 minutes and then spoke with a rude individual shortly after first using the new machine.,0
More frustrating was that I was put on hold twice while the technician consulted with someone else.,0
I had a simple question ( I cannot even remember what it was. ),1
and felt as though I should have been treated better.,0
THE BOTTOM LINE:,0
The Sony VAIO PCG-FRV27 Notebook is a gem of a laptop.,0
I have found that it does everything I want a business use laptop to do and more.,0
My complaints are minimal and the positives far outweigh anything I can think of on the negative side.,0
"Additionally, the battery problems can be cleared up by using the AC adapter or by carrying a backup battery.",0
The customer service issue may be just one individual and a heavy call time.,0
"Regardless, I do not expect to be calling customer service often.",1
I would highly recommend the Sony VAIO PCG-FRV27 Notebook to those who need a powerful computer that will impress.,0
"This is probably too much computer for those who do not have business needs, but you never know when you will need the capabilities that the Sony VAIO PCG-FRV27 Notebook provides.",1
"Without a doubt, a very good new laptop from Sony.",1
I purchased and am quite satisfied with the IBM ThinkPad G40 PC.,0
"There are many models, differing in the clock speed of the Intel chip, the size of the hard disk, whether there is a wireless card built, in, etc.",0
My comments relate to the whole family of G40 ThinkPads.,0
"Prior to purchasing the G40, I was also interested in, and tried out, several Sony Vaio and Dell notebooks.",0
"The Sony had a sharper, glossy display and is much lighter ( the G40 is rather heavy ), but the typing keys were too close together and shallow, and the Vaio can only be booted with the latest Microsoft system (XP ).",0
"In contrast, the G40 can be booted with 98SE, 2000, and both versions of XP.",0
"This was important to me because I purchased several PCs with Windows ME, a defective, unstable system, and only after purchasing them found that the machines could not be formatted for W98 because the chips in the machine expected the ME junk.",1
"Despite what many people claim, PCs are not a commodity, in that the feel of the keyboard and the resolution of the screen differ from company to company and model to model.",1
I was attracted to Dell because it offered customization over the Internet.,0
"I could select what I want ( more memory, better screen ) and dump what I did not want ( overpriced high-end Intel chips, Humvee-sized hard disks ).",1
"And I would not have to spend hours on the'phone, during inconvenient times, with an idiot specifying each part, I could just enter it via the Internet.",1
"But if you want to actually touch a Dell, in most of the world, forget it.",0
"I called Dell from a Chicago location and asked where I could see a demo model, and was told that the nearest location was Florida.",0
"Since the operator was in an Indian call center, he mentioned the Floridia location as if it were the next street down from me, because he had no idea of North American geography.",1
I began to wonder what would happen if I had a technical question and had to talk to someone in India.,0
"I finally managed to play with several Inspirons in Tokyo, but was disappointed by their cheap, creaky plastic parts and the keyboard with substandard key spacing and key travel.",0
"Too bad, otherwise the Inspiron 8600 is a nice machine, but I type lots of reports and articles, and I need a machine with a superb keyboard.",0
I don't have space to add a separate keyboard on my desk.,1
Here is where the G40 shines.,0
It has a wonderful keyboard at an ergonomic angle.,0
"I use my PC mainly for reports, comments, spreadsheets,etc.",0
I don't use it for games ( that's what a PlayStation-Game Cube-Xbox are for ) and I don't use it to read email while I travel ( that's what a PDA is for ).,1
"The G40 accepts a PS/2 plug for keyboards, although the built-in keyboard is excellent by itself.",0
"The PS/2 jack is being phased out of notebooks, like the serial port, but there aren't that many USB keyboards available and who wants to use up all their USB ports with basic equipment?",1
"Besides the keyboard, I was attracted to IBM's responsible service.",0
"IBM has always had well-trained, courteous help staff, and has repaired or replaced problems immediately in past IBMs I have owned.",0
"Sometimes, the repairs were free.",0
"Other times, they were not as expensive as elsewhere.",1
"If one ignores the keyboard and the service, the G40 is a plain vanilla PC.",0
"It is only 2.4GHz, it only ships with 256MB memory (upgrades to 1GB), this model has a 40GB hard disk but that only spins at 4200 rpm instead of the newer 7200 rpm, the memory cache is on the processor and not separate, etc.",1
"Since memory and drives are commodities available cheaply, one wonders why IBM doesn't splurge a bit and include the latest stuff, but IBM was never the low-cost leader.",1
The G40 model I purchased ( 2388-4XJ) comes with 4 USB 2.0 ports.,0
"Other PCs have only 2, and trust me, they will be full from the first week of use.",0
"It also comes with CD RW/DVD, 1 PC card slot, parallel, monitor ports, built-in floppy drive, built-in T100 ethernet, audio jacks and a modem.",0
"I did not want a built-in wireless card, they typically are incompatible with third-party transmitters.",1
The Dell Inspiron 5150 is a powerful notebook with some nice components to give you plenty of power and needs on the go!,0
The power of this notebook is run by the 3.06GHz mobile Intel Pentium 4 processor with 333MHz of DDR memory and the ATI Mobility Radeon 9000 graphics chip.,0
"The Inspiron 5150 is upgradeable with several options, this one that I am reviewing has 512MB of 333MHz DDR RAM, and 64MB of 266MHz RAM for the ATI Mobility Radeon 9000 graphics chip.",0
"Other features include a 15"" Ultra Sharp UXGA Display, a 60GB Ultra ATA Hard Drive and a 2x CD/DVD burner.",0
( DVD+RW/+R ) Added upgrades for Microsoft Windows XP Professional and Microsoft Works Suite 2003.,0
We added a leather case which brought the cost to $ 2377 before tax with a 1 Year Limited Warranty plus 1 Year At-Home Service.,0
The Dell Inspiron 5150 starts as low as $ 1499.,0
The Memory,0
One disappointment in upgrading the Inspiron 5150 was the memory.,0
"The 5150 comes with two slots and the 512 MB of memory for one slot was $ 150 higher in price, so we settled on two 256MB chips.",0
Here is one of those deals that Dell continues to rip off the consumer because the price of two 256MB chips and the one 512MB chip should be about $ 20 difference in cost.,0
The good part is they are using PC 2700 333MHz DDR memory for a faster performance.,0
The Processor,0
"The Dell Inspiron 5150 is available with only one processor, the 3.06GHz mobile Intel Pentium 4 processor with on-die 512K L2 cache and 533 MHz Front Side Bus.",0
This is plenty of processor for anything that you may need for now.,0
The Display,0
"The Inspiron 5150 comes standard with a 15"" SXGA display and an upgrade to a 15 UltraSharp UXGA TFT high-resolution display.",0
"The upgrade to the 15"" Ultra Sharp UXGA Display was a good investment because the display is crystal clear with brilliant colors.",0
Graphics,0
The choice to go with the ATI Mobility Radeon 9000 graphics was a great idea.,0
It comes standard with 32MB of DDR RAM running at 266MHz.,0
It is an AGP 4x graphics card and can be ordered with the 64MB installed.,0
I highly recommend the 64MB over the 32MB.,0
Other Features,0
FireWire,0
"S-Video-out,",0
"VGA, Ethernet",0
Two USB 2.0 ports,0
A 56Kbps-modem V.92,0
One Type II PC Card slot,0
A jack for headphones and a jack for a microphone,0
The Looks,0
The Dell Inspiron 5150 comes in a new Moonlight Silver and Venice blue that makes it look very attractive.,0
"Looking at and around the notebook in the Front and Top you have the 15 inch screen, keyboard, mouse pad and a pair of front mounted speakers.",0
"The left side has a PCMCIA Type I/I I card Slot, Microphone/headphone jacks and a Media bay.",0
The right side has the 56K modem.,0
"The rear has an AC adapter plug-in, S-video out, Two USB ports, Monitor out, IEEE 1304 port and 10/100 Ethernet port.",0
"The bottom has an access door for the memory, the hard drive and battery compartment.",0
Overall,0
Dell did nt include a serial or PS/2 port; these are ports that are outdated today.,1
No big loss on these ports I think you will see them disappear from most systems yet to come.,1
Good choice Dell!,0
Overall the performance is fast; playing DVD movies are no problem at all with a clear and smooth running movie.,1
Games are fast and produce beautiful graphics with no hesitation at all.,1
Color is beautiful on anything that you do with the Inspiron 5150; the games are the most impressive.,0
"The sound through the speakers are fair, they are missing a good bass sound.",0
Adding a nice set of speakers for use at home would be helpful.,0
"The built-in mouse is easy to use, not as good as a regular cordless mouse but for trips it will do fine.",1
At home I still prefer a USB cordless Optical mouse.,0
I was very impressed with the battery use; I get roughly 4 hours of usage before I need to recharge it.,0
"An extra battery here could get you around 8 hours of usage, this maybe something to consider if you are on the go a lot.",0
"I am very impressed with the quality that went into this notebook, in my book the Dell Inspiron 5150 is one of their best computers on the market today!",0
The 5150 has proved to be a true desktop replacement...with all the pros and cons that go along with it.,0
My Model,0
3.06GHz Pentium 4,0
UXGA screen,0
XP Home,0
512 Meg RAM on 2 DIMMs,0
60GB 4200rpm drive,0
2x DVD+RW drive,0
Integrated wireless NIC,0
NVIDIA GeForce FX Go5200 64Mb,0
I am delighted with this machine's performance.,0
"The machine is extremely fast when running at full-speed, and multi-tasks well.",0
"When running at battery-conservation speeds, the machine is still very responsive, though I do notice occasional sluggishness while trying to listen to MP3's and process large files in Photoshop.",0
The screen is fantastic!,0
It is well suited for the demands of photo editing; vastly superior than my previous laptop ( IBM T22 ).,0
The color range is noticeably better -- pure whites and deep blacks.,0
"The screen is also noticeably brighter than my IBM T22, and reasonably usable in outdoor shade.",0
"I would estimate that the screen is still readable at about 130-degrees, though the brightness falls-off outside of 90-degrees.",0
I am still working to adjust to the massive 1600x1200 native resolution.,0
Some websites just aren't intended for such a large resolution.,1
"The screen is still very usable at lower resolutions, despite some diminished quality.",0
"So far, the system has had no problems sleeping or hibernating.",1
"The options are very configurable -- hard-drive, processor, screen, network, etc -- based on inactivity, or closing the screen.",0
I have un-installed most of the Dell software.,0
All software un-installed flawlessly.,0
"I left the Dell Support Alerts, but it has proved worthless and will soon be removed.",0
It's just a shot-gun approach to curbing customer service contacts.,0
"I am constantly being reminded of Windows updates I've already downloaded, and tips on how to burn CD's using Roxio -- things I don't need alerts for.",0
"I've set it for critical alerts only, but still receive the Roxio messages every couple of days.",0
"After reading feedback from others, I was concerned that my 4200rpm hard-drive might be too slow.",0
"It hasn't been an issue for me, even though I listen to mp3's and work with large Photoshop files at the same time.",1
I was pleasantly surprised by the battery life!,0
"I can easily get 2 hours, and up to 3.5 if I'm conservative.",0
"For two hours, all I do is lower the CPU speed.",0
I can still use the screen at full brightness and listen to mp3's.,0
The touchpad takes some getting used to.,0
I miss the trackpoint on my IBM Thinkpad.,0
"But the touchpoint is very configurable, and includes some thoughtful capabilities.",0
"You can tap on it to double-click, and you can configure it to continue scrolling the mouse when you reach the edge of the pad.",0
"Even with the sensitivity set to high, it still takes more muscle work than either the trackpoint or a regular mouse.",0
"The DVD Burner works flawlessly, and it is much faster than my old 16x CD burner.",0
The ability to burn 4.7Gig of digital photos onto a single disk is VERY nice.,0
"Since the drive fits under the palm rest, you can feel a little bit of heat while you're burning disks.",0
"It's not hot enough to cause discomfort, but you are reminded why they call it""burning.""",1
The integrated wireless card was a smart way to go.,0
"Works even better than my PCMCIA card, and there is no protruding antennae.",1
The overall build construction isn't as solid as my IBM Thinkpad.,0
"This machine is more""plasticy.""",0
"When picking it up with one hand, you can feel the case flex a bit.",0
"But given this machine's weight, I won't be holding it with one hand for prolonged periods, anyway.",0
Very quiet -- compared to my desktop PC.,0
Minor gripes...,0
I wish the headphone jack didn't get in the way of the cd tray.,0
I also wish the PCMCIA card adapter was easier to eject.,0
"The included DVD viewing software is clunky, but it works.",0
"Like all laptops, I find some of the key locations awkward.",0
"The eject button on the CD tray has a little too much""play"" in it.",0
"The keys are a little flimsy, and I suspect I will catch one of them with the edge of my finger and break it, eventually.",0
But that also happened on my Thinkpad.,0
I don't like the sliver/blue design -- what was wrong with grey and black?,0
I am extremely happy with my purchase.,0
Canceled my order for an Inspiron 8500 for the 5150 - and have no regrets.,1
"This sweet notebook has everything I was looking for: performance, value, quality construction, and CAE capability.",0
Everything worked flawlessly out of the box - except for strange behavior of the second USB port.,0
Updated drivers downloaded from the Dell support site later cleared that problem.,0
"I took advantage of the free 512 MB upgrade offer, and added the 60 GB HDD.",0
"The 4200 RPM speed is a bit behind the curve, but use of a larger disk cache (XP or 3rd party ) can compensate for this somewhat.",0
"As another reviewer observed, Dell's expansion options are occasionally overpriced.",0
"Compare, pick, and choose.",0
"A trip to local computer store ( Fry's ) yielded lower-cost port expander, 12-volt adapter, floppy drive, and USB networking cable.",0
"PC2700 notebook RAM is available much cheaper over the WWW, when upgrade time comes around.",0
Just order what Dell offers'free'.,0
I also ordered an extra battery pack from Dell.,0
"Haven't needed it yet, since a 3-hour DVD movie leaves 40 % capacity to spare on a single battery.",0
"The tilde key is in an awkward place; otherwise the keyboard is fine, and does not have the problems reported for the Inspiron 8500.",1
Built-in sound quality is poor: headphones or external speakers work fine.,0
"I miss the printer and serial ports, since I didn't want to replace my legacy home office equipment.",0
"The USB port expander fixed that, and works well.",0
"With that and an external USB 2.0 HDD enclosure for my old 80 GB drive ( now used for backups ), I was able to retire the old desktop: the 5150 is my'main' machine on the road AND at home, with NO sacrifices.",1
"These omissions are VERY minor: this is a beautiful, first-rate desktop replacement for gaming or serious engineering work.",0
"The basics are rock solid: processor, chipset, FSB/memory speed, display, graphics acceleration, performance/battery life, quiet operation, runs cool.",0
"The just-released Inspiron 8600 may be a better choice for gaming or DVD viewing, but I believe the 5150 is a better fit for CPU-intensive business and engineering use.",0
Why no reviews on this model?,1
Because most folks are not familiar with the name Sharp as far as computers go.,1
This is a brand exclusive to Circuit City so I don't think most folks feel comfortable with it yet.,1
They should give it a try.,0
There is a lot to love about the Sharp Actius RD10.,0
It has so many features that other laptops do not.,1
Number one on my list is:,0
NO Shared memory!,1
"That's right, most laptops have about a half a gig of SDRAM, but they share that with the video.",0
"Now, in the majority of cases this won't be an issue.. but if you plan to play any of todays graphic-intense games, you need it to not be shared.",1
That was what swung us to buy this model.,0
We can't be having our memory smashed in the middle of battle.. know what I'm sayin?,1
heh.,0
No problemo with this baby!,1
"Number two would be the display: Amazingly crisp, bright, and clear display.",0
Brighter even than any of our CRTs!,0
"On our desk tops we're running a Sony Multiscan 400PS on mine, and a Samsung Syncmaster 1200NF.",0
This laptop monitor blows them both away on clarity.,0
I'm not talking hmm I think that is a little brighter.,1
I'm talking Oh hell look at the difference in this puppy!,0
It's also surprising to me that there is no difference in this between battery or if it's plugged in.,1
Just a freakin sweet display!,0
"The sound is also, of course, built in.",0
"There are two speakers up near the display and while they won't rival your desk top speakers, they do the job.",1
"You won't want to be cranking your music CDs on this, but for watching a DVD or cruising the web they are more than adequate.",1
Have a digital camera?,0
Plug your memory card right in to the front side!,0
"That's right, no need for extra gadgets, this sucker I believe has a slot for about any size camera flash card.",1
It fits my Cannon and has other slots for other sizes.,0
Very convenient indeed...and it's fast.,0
"Actually, the pictures come up faster on this than on my big Micron Millennia.",0
The wireless ( 802.11B ) is built in.,0
"Again, no need to keep track of endless accessories for everything, it's all right here built in.",1
The wireless works seemlessly on this baby too.,0
I could tell no difference between cruising the web on this with the wirelss and my PC which is cabled to the hub.,1
It worked when we took it upstairs too.,0
"That may speak to the effectiveness of our wireless thingy in general, but I tend to think it's a combo of that and the wireless set up in the Sharp itself.",0
All the geeky stuff:,0
"2.8-GHz Pentium 4, 512MB of DDR SDRAM, Windows XP Home, 15-inch XGA screen, NVidia GeForce4 420 Go with 32MB of DDR SDRAM, 60GB hard drive, 8X DVD-ROM and 24X/10X/24X CD-RW combo drive, built-in V.90 modem, 10/100 ethernet port, touchpad pointing device, One-year parts and labor warranty; lifetime 24-hour daily toll-free technical support.",0
"Battery life is not something I am concerned about, but this one is only about an hour and a half.. probably due to the awesome display.",1
"In the car I can plug into the cigarette lighter though, and the hotel of course has jacks, airlines also have plug-ins if you have the adapter..",0
"I can't think of very often that I would need more than that hour and a half of battery life anyway, and if you're smart you always keep a spare battery anyway.",1
"So, to me at least, that isn't even an issue.",1
I figured some of you may like to know though.,0
"It has no serial or parallel printer ports, but it does have 4 USB 2.0 ports.",1
"( I have no idea what I just said, Nick told me to add this part )",1
Why am I replacing this if I like it so much?,0
Because it's very heavy at 10.3 pounds ( 12.2 with the adapter and all that stuff ) and over 2 inches thick.,0
"Yep.. sad to say, but it's like lugging bricks around.",0
"In fact, I'm having a difficult time finding a bag that it will fit in even.",0
"This is one behemoth mo'fo, I'm tellin ya!",0
"So...the thing is I do recommend this machine, just not for folks who travel a lot.",1
"This would be very good as a desk top replacement for a college student in a dorm, or as an additional home unit in another room or something.",0
For compact travel though?,0
No way.,1
I think we're going to go buy a little Sony today for our trip to New York next week.,0
"As much as I love the features on this Sharp, I just am not lugging the damn thing around!",1
"I don't usually write in electronics, so you folks need to tell me if I left anything out here.",1
"I do plan to review whatever we decide to buy tonight also, so please do give me a heads up if there is any vital info you want in addition to what I have put here.",0
Thanks guys!,0
I bought this computer almost 4 months ago.,0
Still works: ).,0
But let's review it.,0
First what I liked about this model is that it is really everything in one.,0
"It contains all(still, computer world so fast changing, that almost everyday there is more invented, so correct me if I will be wrong ) possible media readers.",0
Well someone can wonder why there is floppy disc reader?,0
i mean floppy is really old fashioned and probably will be gone sooner or later.,0
"But meanwhile, there is people who will use it.",0
"Other readers include Sony Memory stick, SD card, Smart Media, Compact Flash, Pc Card slot.",0
Well can't forget to mention that there is 4 USB and one FireWire port.,0
"Also 60 GB hard drive... my god, this computer probably made for file storage...",0
But I must tell that is computer isn't perfect.,0
First - display.,0
"It is advertised as extreme brightness and wide vieving angles, at least sticker on computer say so.",0
"Well it is bright, but don't forget that it is ONLY XGA!",0
"I can compare this computer with other computers, with xga lcd.",0
"It is brighter, but comparing with sxga ( I am not talking about uxga)it is not so good.",1
I mean brightness is not all.,1
"How about picture detail, crispness?",0
"Besides, that brightness adjustment button is not necessary.",1
"When you turn brightness off, the view on screen is dull.",0
Well might be it save some battery life... Speaking about battery.,0
Battery's life is too short to call this computer a laptop.,0
It is not enough mobile.,1
"By the way, if your battery is fully charged and you turn computer on, don't be fooled - battery monitor show that you can use it for 3 hours, but after about 5 minutes, it show that only a little bit than hour left( correct time ).",1
"Ok, I can sacrifice short battery life - my laptop is used as desktop replacement anyway, so I am happy to have one peace instead of 4-6 basic ones.",0
But lets continue cons list.,0
"ok, how about brand name?",0
It is made by Sharp.,0
"So it means that it is not so easy to find this laptop in every store, by the way, recently even in circuit city couldn't find it... Must be was out of stock or something?.. Still i guess that other brands could charge more for the same stuff.",1
"I bought it for more than 1700 $ (with a 100$ mail in rebate,and some other catches: ) ) but now it cost about 1300-1400.",0
"processor speed seems a champion when you look at the data sheet ( pentium 4, 2.8 ghz ), but when you use a laptop, it seems it is a little bit slower than it suppose to be.",0
Especially when you turn it on after it was turned off.,0
"I use a password to protect it, so it takes couple extra seconds, but when it is on, I can't use any programs, because it freeze for about 5 minutes.unless",0
"i leave a program running and close lid, so it shuts down, but it is faster to start it.",0
Actius rd10 is locked to microsoft windows xp home edition.,0
"So I guess it wouldn't be popular among computer pros, who want linux or even other windows... My opinion is that windows'95 is better than xp.",0
"But I cannot mess up with OS... ussually when i play dvd and laptop run on batteries, dvd play with some interupptions.",1
"It is like running on pause step by step, frame by frame, and again at normal speed.",0
"Burned music on cds sounds metalish like music was performed with bad equipment, even using other cd players.",0
Upgrading lovers will be disappointed when they find out that memory is upgradable only 256 mb.,0
When hard drive fills up coputer slow down a lot.,0
"Computer fan run almost all the time, and it is louder than some desktop's.",0
Ok I guess I said enough to prevent from buying this item.,0
"But if I had an opportunity to choose a laptop again, I most likely would buy this one again.",0
"At least for these all options - pentium 4( 2.8 ghz ), bunch of media readers, spacy hard drive, cd-rw/dvd drive, NOT shared video memory, I can play games perfectly.",1
"It has wireless 802.11b, even I don't use at all, but it is nice to have: ).",0
"Laptop don't have printer port, so you will either use a cord-adaptor or one of 4 usb ports.",0
You can even lock this computer using special lock.,0
"I bought this computer as a desktop replacement, after I study other computer data sheets.",0
"It seems that even after 4 months this computer is more advanced than others, and price is attractive.",0
HP has come out with their own 17 inch widescreen notebook labeled the zd7000 which is the customizabe version of the zd70XX series.,0
"so if you see other notebooks with zd70XX, everything would apply except for certain things like the processor speed, amount of ram and video ram, size of the harddrive, and if the wireless option is installed.",0
"and now that you know the difference, lets get on with the review.",0
my specs are:,0
3.2 ghz processor,0
512 MB ram,0
128 mb nvidia geforce graphics,0
80 GB 4200 hard drive,0
dvd+r dvd writer,0
"i wish now that i actually opted in for the wireless, but when i had ordered my machine, i was under the impression that the wireless card was just a pcmci card which i already had, this was because on the HP website, they showed a pcmci card next to the laptop, but then later updated the image to show a mini pci card which is correct.",0
"this would work better since embedded behind the laptop screen, there are antennaes which greatly increase the effectiveness of the wireless.",0
but i was mislead and now i suffer for it.,0
"and dont think that you can use another mini pci card because there have been other people that have had problems doing this because the bios checks for a particular brand of mini pci card, adn they have not been able to change the bios or anything to make it work.",1
so might as well be safe and get it preinstalled.,0
"other than that, I am extremely happy with this laptop.",0
its not quite as nice as my apple g4 17 but then what is?,1
so here's the run down:,0
screen,0
the screeen is HUGE! 17 inches with a resolution of 1440x900.,0
"thats really impressive, i definitely have more work space, and the colors are crisp, although it will seem a bit dull under flourescent lighting, but this is due to them not installing a protective shield like the toshiba p25-s607 which also uses this screen, but seems crisper.",1
but their screens dont look great outdoors.,0
so its a trade off.,0
"the screen is bright and beautiful, especially when watching dvds. it just blows my mind how great it looks.",0
"one thing that would seem weird is that the screen is narrower than what you may be used to with other laptops or monitors, but this is a wide screen, and therefore you get more sideways real estate but also lose the top-to-bottom real estate.",0
"all in all, the screen is fantastic.",0
I have been able to work with 2 full windows of word or excel ( that doesnt mean maximized ) and its just great expecially when editing documents.,0
keyboard and touchpad,0
the keyboard is also cool because it features the numeric keypad which i havent seen on other laptops.,0
"but don;t let that alone be the reason to buy this. the keys are a bit stiff and springy which is great for the tactile typers, but if you have carpal tunnel, like i do, it does tend to aggravate it somewhat, which is why i use an external keyboard that has softer keys.",0
"the keyboard is a full size keyboard, which is great with no real odd key placements like some laptop vendors do.",1
you also get a full size backspace key too which comes in handy a lot.,0
"as for the touchpad, one annoying design issue is that they decided to make the touchpad wide, so when i do type through the keyboard and i tend to rest my palms on the laptop, my hands tend to somehow glide onto the touchpad which puts the cursor somewhere.",0
"this movement is annoyingh especially when editing documents because i would accidentally move the cursor somewhere so that when i do look at the screen to see what else i would need, i would find the text in odd places.",0
"This is definitely annoying, but I havent heard of any other complaints.",0
even decreasing the sensitivity doesnt completely fix the solution.,0
"also, near the top of the touchpad, it does tend to get a bit warn.",0
"all in all the touchpad is responsive and sometimes the cursors can jump around when using it, so I would recommend using an external mouse, like the logitech mx700.",0
sound,0
"the speakers on this laptop are harmon kardon speakers, and they are fanastic.",0
i haven't heard sound this great on a laptop ever.,0
"i had a bunch of mp3 from my last computer that I played on this laptop and at first, I thought the speakers weren't any good because of the tinny sound, but then I realized that it was because of the bit rate encoding, it was encoded at 96 bits instead of 128 or 196 for cd quality.",0
"once i popped in a cd, the sounds came alive.",0
"I was pleasantly surprised by this, and it does get loud, unlike some laptops where even if you put the sound at the highest setting, you still can barely hear it.",0
Not with these speakers.,1
I actually only have the volume at 2 or 3 bars because its so loud.,0
"One this missing though is a subwoofer, but thats a small price to pay.",0
battery life...battery life...battery life...,0
"it wont last longer than 2 hrs, but you can do some power saving things such as reduce the brightness of the screen, dont use the dvd drive, etc, but then whats the fun? this is definitely meant as a desktop replacement.",1
"for you just want to take it with you, but only if there is a deskt and an outlet available.",0
otherwise you should purchase extra batteries or one of those solar panels that can power it up.,0
"along the lines of battery power, is the actual power converter or brick.",0
"man, this thing is heavy.",0
its slightly larger than other converters too.,0
"and its also a 3 prong plug going into the brick, so if you plan on using a mini power surge protector, belkin has a nice one, i dont think targus makes one, or at least they didnt have one at best buy.",0
over all impressions,0
"my overall impression of the laptop is two thumbs up. the blue lighting is very mesmerizing, and the dvd drive is very responsive.",0
"i havent tried burning a dvd yet, i have to find some tiem to buy dvd r blanks, i wish it were a multi drive, but can't have everything.",0
"also, the dvd drive is a 4x drive, the included roxio software lists it as a 2.4x but when I installed nero 6, it read it as a 4x drive.",0
the media slots are also a plus.,0
"they let you use your smart digital, memory stick, and 3 others which i dont know off hand, but those are the ones i use, and it works great.",0
no more carrying around the adapter for these.,1
"the case definitely seems sturdy, there is no flex in the keyboard, at least none that i can tell ( i dont want to break this ) and also this laptop is heavy.",1
its about 10 pounds with the battery and the adapter.,0
"there are 4 usb 2.0 connections and a firewire conenction, the small one, parallel port and vga out.",0
"there is also s-video out which i havent tried, but will do soon.",0
downsides,0
some of the design problems i have with this are that the ac plug goes into the back left of the laptop instead of at the back.,0
"this is ok, but annoying.",0
"the placement of the volume buttons being on the top of the keybaord, near the quick launch buttons, who thought of this? i guess ive been spoiled with volume buttons being on the sides.",0
"the only firewire connection is on the left side which is also weird, b/c I tend to just leave my firewire external hdd plugged in, so i usually have this plug protruding from the left side.",0
thats somewhat annyoing.,0
the size of the beast also makes it difficult to purchase bags.,0
"since it just hit the market, most bags that are able to carry it are bulky and ugly.",0
and the ones that fit the G4 wont fit this.,0
which blows because now i have to find another bag.,0
"i was hoping the timbuk2 bag which just came out for the g4 would fit, but to no avail.",1
it was made to tightly fit the apple.,0
"another thing is when typing with this on yer laptop, which i dont recommend since you will be covering the fan inlets, the positioning the keybaord will make it weird to type.",0
"that definitely takes some getting used to, and the heat makes it not feel so good.",1
"it doesnt get as hot as the apple, but it gets uncomfortably warm.",0
"one other thing is that this laptop doesnt have themedia controls that many other laptops have, that allow you to play your cds without turning on the computer.",1
conclusion,0
this machine is great.,0
its definitely an investment to be happy with.,0
"i especially liked the fact that i could customize it to my liking, and when yer buying a laptop, especially a wintel machine, you want to think about the future and what you'll be able to do.",0
"the HT or hyperthreading on this is great an all, but there arent that many applications that can take advantage of that just yet, other than some of those intensive graphics apps and database apps.",0
but its cool to have!,0
also the 128MB of video ram also allows me to play future games as well as todays latest.,0
"i havent had a chance to load up some graphics heavy games, but from what i saw on my friends with only 64 mb on his toshiba p25, i am sure mine will blow his away!",0
I have been looking to replace our aging laptop for a while.,0
I sat down and thought about how we have been using it and realized that we really didn't do much mobile computing; I mainly used it as a home base when we traveled.,0
Keeping this in mind steered me toward a desktop replacement type of laptop.,0
As far as desktop replacements go this one is at the top of the pack.,0
I bought the zd7040 which is the version available at Best Buy.,0
"Most other computer stores have the zd7020, the only difference is that the 7040 has a 60Gig hard drive and the 7020 has an 80Gig.",0
Best Buy had a great 18 month no interest deal and the extended warranty was better.,1
The screen has to be seen to be believed.,0
It is 17 diagonally with a widescreen ratio.,0
This could substitute for your main TV in a pinch.,0
The contrast is very good and the images are very sharp.,0
The processor is a desktop Pentium 4 at 2.8GHz.,0
Different models may have faster/slower versions.,0
I think there is even one with the new hyper threading processor for bigger $ $.,0
This model has the GeForce to go FX 5600 chip with 64Megs of RAM.,0
I ran 3DMark2001 benchmarks and got over 10000!,0
My older desktop with a GeForce 4 4200 could nt get that high.,0
This thing really is a nice desktop crammed into a portable  package.,0
Dont mislead yourself into thinking you will be working away on a long flight.,0
"This thing probably wont even fit on an average tray table, it is that big.",1
It weighs about 10 pounds with the AC adapter.,0
The battery life is also not that great.,1
"I worked in our living room for a while and got about 45 minutes when the battery read 50 %, so I am guessing about 1  hours with normal use.",0
I think if you are playing some 3D games it will be less.,0
"Hey, at least you can play some 3D games.",0
This graphics chip supports Direct X9.,0
How many laptops can say that!,0
"There are ports-a-plenty: ( 4 ) USB 2.0, one firewire, one S-video out, one VGA, one parallel, headphones, mic, 10/100 Ethernet, modem, IR, 5 different digital media reader ( compact flash, SD, memory stick, etc. ), ( 2 ) Type I PCMCIA slot or ( 1 ) Type II slot.",0
This actually has more ports than my desktop!,0
The keyboard is full sized and there is a numeric pad on the right ( the Toshiba model that also uses this screen does nt have the numeric pad and does nt look nearly as cool ).,1
The touchpad is pretty good and the software lets you do some neat stuff.,0
"One weird thing is that HP has the tap-click feature ( that everyone else uses ) disabled by default, but you can change it in the settings.",0
This model has a DVD +R/RW drive but I have nt tried it out yet.,0
It reads CD just fine and plays DVDs great.,0
The sound is by Harmon Kardon and is OK.,0
I have Harmon Kardon in my car and I am not overly impressed.,1
I think Bose would do a better job.,0
It still sounds way better than most tinny laptop speakers.,0
"For the amount of room they had to work with though, I would think they could have done even better.",0
One thing that is bothersome is the amount of power it consumes.,0
I cant find an auto adapter to power it.,0
It looks like it draws about 120 watts but the new Targus 120 watt auto adapter does nt say it supports it.,0
Maybe in a few months the situation will improve.,0
Overall I am very happy but this is the Hummer of laptops.,0
For what it was built to do it does very well.,0
Just don't think it will be something it isn't ( like light ).,1
Bradman,0
I just barely received my new PowerMac G5.,0
It's the 1.6 ghz model with a little more than standard RAM and hard drive space.,0
It's awesome...,0
The blazing speed of this computer is amazing.,0
"I am on a budget for school, and so I did not get the 1.8 or the 2.0 ghz models.",1
But I can't see how anything could get faster.,0
"Not only can I run everything and anything at once, but I can do it with such incredible stability that it would make any window's user cry.",1
"I can literally go down to the dock ( containing 30+ items ), and click on every program there, and they will all start up fine without any crashing at all.",1
Find a PC that can do that.,0
It is truelly awesome.,0
The new OS that is bundeled with it is awesome too!,0
Panther is so cool!,0
I have Expos on and its is sooo handy!,0
"You can go from window to window so easily, seamlessly, flawlessly, and quickly, without any clutter or confusion of any kind!",1
Its so fast too!,0
"You can have no windows on the desktop viewable, but hit the option key ( in my case anyway ), and bang!",1
"All the windows that you might have open, are right there at your finger tips.",0
It's nothing short of genius.,0
More about the hardware: The graphics on this computer are great.,0
"Playing Quake 3, Unreal 2024, All the high end, graphically demanding games glide on this computer.",0
I get more frames per second in both games than I would ever need!,0
"In Quake 2, running at 1600x1200, with 32-bit color, maximum texturing etc.",0
I was still pulling off 320 frames per second.,0
Thats just amazing.,0
"I don't know the specific number of frames on the newer games, but in Q2 I was getting incredible frames.",0
I have the second rate video card in there.,0
I can only imagine what the faster machines get.,0
There is tons of free software that comes with this computer!,0
"iTunes4, iMovie, iPhoto, iChat etc.",0
They are all so useful.,0
iTunes let you LEGALLY download music.,0
"It's not available for Windows, but still.",1
"The iTunes music store is a way for both the record companies, and the users to feel satisfied.",0
They are great deals.,0
$ 10 for most CD's!? Thats a steal compared to most.,0
The Powermac G5 is a great computer for anyone.,0
"It is more than capable for any task thrown at it, and it has power to spare.",0
"It's free packaged Software are a plus, and the new Operating Sustem is brilliant!",0
I have had my G5 for about a month.,0
And I really love it.,0
I went to the local Apple store to get my G5.,0
"I got the Dual 2gHz Model with 512 Meg memory, 160 G hard drive, DVD RW/R/CD-R/RW and Radeon 9600.",0
OS: OSX 10.3 ( Panther ),0
"I brought it home, made my connections to the appropriate periphials, and turned it on.",0
The welcome screen came up within a matter of SECONDS.,0
This was the first clue that this really IS a fast machine.,0
I registered and then logged in.,0
After I loaded all of my software ( which took me about 2 hours ) I started playing around with it.,0
"I have a lot of graphic intensive and memory hogging software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Final Cut Pro, DVD Studio Pro, etc. ALL of them it handled like butta!",0
The Plusses:,0
It's FAST.,0
This machine handles processes SO efficiently and it shows because moving from one command to the next it really does zip.,0
"Also, when rebooting, it reboots within 15 seconds - if that doesn't tell you something I don't know will!!",1
It's FAST.,0
Burining DVDs and CDs are LIGHTENING fast!,0
"Seriously, within 3 or 4 minutes in most cases.",0
It's incredible.,0
It's EXPANDABLE.,0
It's true that the G5 isn't as expandable as one would think for a machine of this caliber and price.,0
But I really don't find it necessary.,0
"You can have 2 hard drives, up to 8 GB of memory, it has 4 additional PCI slots on the back for additional expansion cards, it can have only one CD ROM/DVD ROM slot but why do you need more than one anyway?",0
It has 4 USB ports and 3 firewire ports including the 800 Firewire.,0
Optical Digital input and output.,0
And more.,0
I would say it has everything you need.,0
I do a lot of video editing as well as design and I use everything this machine has and I haven't done anything to expand it with the exception of additional memory and a pre-existing Firewire drive I had.,0
It's Beautiful: It is as sexy as a machine can get.,0
Keeps its word: It does everything they say it will do and more and does it fast.,0
THE CONS:,0
No Virtual PC: I only ever used Virtual PC to use Microsoft Access which is unavailable for the MAC.,1
You cannot use Virtual PC on a G5 due to some technical stuff - the G5 doesn't posess something that G4's had and which VPC ran on.,1
So sorry if you depend on Virtual PC I'd wait until Microsoft comes out with the new version ( probably in another year or so ) as they are not releasing a patch,1
CRASHING: The first 3 days I had my G5 it crashed A LOT.,0
At least 5 or 6 times a day.,1
I suspect that it was because of software compatability issues but still it was annoying and disconcerting after spending $ 3000 on it and I never had this problem on my Powerbook G4.,1
"However, that issue seems to have subsided as it no longer happens.",1
Only certain programs would crash and that seems to have been rectified by adding more memory.,0
"So now, it works great!",0
It's BIG: I don't really consider this a plus or minus but I'm putting it here for those with a premium on space.,0
It's EXPENSIVE: I don't mind paying a lot for something that is worth it and this machine is worth it but it was still A LOT even with my student discount.,0
Guess that's all I have to say.,0
It's a great machine,0
"The PowerMac G5 is a computer designed for two types of person: The power-mad user of CPU-sapping programs like Final Cut Pro and After Effects, and the person who just wants to look like one.",0
"For the latter type, Apple has an entirely new case design, one that is beautifully made, but looks formal, stiff, a little stand-offish.",0
"It is not warm and fuzzy; my friend Amber will not hug it, as she did my PowerMac G4 at work; she would probably slide a finger or two over it, admiring the smooth, brushed-aluminum surface.",1
"In short, it looks impressive, much more impressive, a formidable piece of engineering.",0
But those who like to hug computers might want to find one of the last old G4 models.,0
The G5 is taller and somewhat thinner than the old model.,0
"It's lighter, being made of aluminum instead of steel.",0
Setup and Installation,0
"Setup and installation are, as usual, done with the same meticulous good taste and sleekness of all Apple products.",0
"You turn it on, plug in the keyboard, mouse and monitor and while it's setting itself up, it treats you to a somehow dazzling but tasteful and understated"" Welcome"" in ten different languages.",0
Subtle and pleasant new age music joins you as you start typing in your registration details.,0
"And the process continues, smooth, pleasant and tasteful until it is all done and you have a set up internet connection and all is well.",0
"I thought there was a big problem at this point, since the networking didn't work, but due inspection showed that I had simply forgotten to plug in my Ethernet cable.",0
Don't do that.,0
"After that, it started to work flawlessly.",0
I don't buy computers to look at their case design!,0
How's it perform?,0
All routine operations are blisteringly fast.,0
"Applications open fast, web pages load fast, even the rather resource-heavy Apple mail runs fast.",0
And all of this happens with a tiny fraction of CPU use.,0
"Encouraged by this, I decided on a stress test no computer I'd ever owned could pass.",1
I decided to try capturing video and then using my machine for other stuff.,0
"Video capture is one of the most difficult things you can ask a computer to do, because it all has to be done in real time.",0
"If it drops as little as one frame out of the 30 coming at it per second, the capture is useless.",0
"Because of this, video capture is usually a mind-numbingly boring procedure where you sit at your computer, stare at your footage and ( since you can't edit it at this point ) become bored to tears.",0
Not so on the PowerMac G5!,1
My first attempt at this didn't work because I was installing LiveType at the same time.,1
It turns out that you can't install something from a CD while capturing video.,0
But you can do pretty much anything else you want.,0
"I was playing music with iTunes, checking my mail every minute, writing a message on my web browser, cruising the web and switching between mail and web constantly.",0
The system handled this all perfectly.,0
This is a big deal.,0
"On all my older computers ( PowerBook G4, PowerMac G4/450 dual ), I could not do ANYTHING else while capturing video.",1
I had to close all my other programs to prevent dropped frames.,0
"On this computer, with the standard 512mb RAM, everything just worked.",0
"I'm still getting used to the computer, and I have a lot to learn about optimizing its performance.",0
"But so far, I'm very pleased; it seems much faster than the benchmarks imply.",0
"If there's more interest in real-world performance, I'll add to this epinion later on when I have more results.",0
The 9 Fans,0
"I am having problems with my home air conditioning, and as a result my house has been a bit hot.",0
"It is a bit of a trip to see - well, hear - how my new computer reacts to its difficult environment.",0
"The computer will be silent for a while, and then when I ask it to work hard it begins howling like a banshee.",0
"When I start working on it after a period of inactivity, the fans will run loud for a few seconds and then restore themselves to silence.",0
"Based on other reviews, I don't think this will be a problem for a typical household environment.",1
"When my air conditioning gets fixed, I'll post an addendum about the change in fan behaviour, if any.",0
"I suspect it would be almost inaudible if I placed it under my desk instead of on top of it, but then I couldn't admire it's good looks, could I?",0
"The bottom line, then, is that if you have a hot room, prepare for a suprisingly noisy computer as it protects itself from the hostile environment outside.",0
"I recommend a comparably loud speaker system when in a loud environment, and remember, you can play music through iTunes even when your computer is capturing video.",0
"I should emphasize, however, that a comparably powerful PC would have a whole bunch of fans that would be on constantly.",0
"Compared to the kind of PC that's often used for video editing applications and the like, the PowerMac is quiet enough.",0
It's just that most people aren't going to put that kind of computer in a room where noise is an issue.,1
Buying Tips,0
I do not advise the purchase of any hot Apple product from the online Apple Store.,1
"In most cases, you will actually get your product faster if you purchase it from the retail Apple Stores on the day it becomes available there.",0
"At the time I bought my machine at the Apple Store in the Grove shopping center in LA, there were people stacked up in the mail order queue who had ordered months before I did.",0
"Since the savings for buying via mail order are literally non-existant ( with sales tax and full retail prices still charged ), there is literally no reason in the world not to buy retail.",1
"Well, there is one.",0
"Certain build to order options, such as getting a 250gb drive instead of the stock 160, can only be obtained online.",0
"For me, with projects to do and stuff to accomplish, it wasn't worth waiting three weeks to get a bigger drive.",1
"You should always buy your memory upgrades from a third party, not Apple.",1
Apple memory upgrade prices are absurd to the point of comic relief.,0
"For example, upgrading my system from 512mb to 2-1gb sticks ( total of 2gb ) would cost over $ 1,000 when purchased from Apple.",0
"Two third-party 1gb memory sticks would cost me around $ 620, and I would still have the original 512mb ( thus a total of 2.5gb instead of 2.0gb ).",0
Other Considerations,0
The old G4s could accomodate 4 hard drives in the case.,0
"The new G5, despite its larger case, can only accomodate 2. Fortunately, support for the new FireWire 800 standard makes this less important than it used to be, but it's still annoying and feels like a step backwards.",0
"Hard drives have gotten much larger than in the G4 days, but hard drive usage, driven by DV video, has accelerated even faster.",0
Every component of the G5 has undergone a makeover.,0
"Faster video, faster memory, faster disk interfaces, everything's faster.",0
What this means is that you shouldn't even try upgrading your machine to a G5 if and when upgrades come out.,0
You won't get the performance you need.,1
"Surprisingly, the keyboard on the G5 is a significant improvement from the G4's.",0
"With the G4s, the mushy keys often didn't register my keystrokes, especially when trying to type capital letters.",0
"With the G5, the keyboard is still mushier than I'd like, but it's at least reliable; when I hit the shift key, I always get capital letters.",0
"So if you've relied on third-party keyboards in the past, give the G5's a shot.",0
"Sound on the built-in speaker is poor, but since most people will buy third-party stereo speakers for a system of this class, that didn't wind up being significant.",0
MacOS X,0
MacOS X really started coming into its own when I bought my PowerBook 1ghz system late last year.,0
"Menus snapped into place, everything scrolled quickly, and so on.",0
The dual G5 makes the PowerBook G4 look and feel downright sluggish.,0
"It's probably not more than things taking.1 second instead of.5 second, but it feels even more responsive than the old system.",1
The operating system is every bit as much of a brilliantly designed art object as the computer itself.,0
"If you want a good reason to switch from Windows, the tasteful elegance of MacOS X is an excellent one.",0
"And, of course, the performance.",0
Conclusion,0
"I'd say a healthy percentage of those who have deserted the Mac platform during its sluggish days are going to return to it through this speedy, brilliantly designed machine.",0
"This is an expensive product, but unlike 99 % of computers made today, it has the fit, finish, look and feel of something polished to gleaming perfection.",0
"If you have the money, you won't regret getting this computer for a second.",0
"At the end of July, I found it necessary to replace my trusty Dual 1GHz G4 ( QuickSilver 2002 ).",0
"Since I've never before owned a"" cutting edge"" computer, always choosing to buy machines that were near their""end-of-life,"" I decided to take a chance on the hottest of the hot, the Dual 2GHz G5.",1
"So, I ordered one.",0
And waited.,0
And waited.,0
And waited some more.,0
Apple had to re-authorize the charge on my card twice before I received a nice e-mail that included the FedEx tracking number.,0
"Then I spent another week waiting, checking the FedEx tracking website for progress, and making sure someone was here to receive the package when it arrived.",0
"Even the box it arrived in screams,"" I'm stylish, I'm beautiful, and GOOD GRIEF I'M FAST.""",0
"Opening the black cardboard box reveals a sheet of cardboard over the accessories, including the keyboard and mouse, a phone cord, a USB extension cable ( nice touch, Apple! ) for those who'd like their keyboard to be a bit farther from the machine, and the power cable.",0
"Removing the G5 from its cradle of styrofoam, I just had to stop to admire the work.",0
The case is made of plain matte-finished aluminum with an Apple logo embossed very lightly in a different texture.,0
"Unless you have the light just right, you won't even see it.",0
"All of the seams meet perfectly, and I found no irregularities at all.",1
Setting the computer up was a snap.,0
"I set it on my desktop ( fortunately for me, I don't use one of the"" computer cubbies"" so popular with home-office furniture - the G5 very likely wouldn't fit, being about 10 % larger than my old Dual G4 ), plugged in the power cable, the USB cable for the keyboard and mouse, the video cable to the monitor, and the network cable to the hub.",0
"As a show of workmanship, Apple even had the end of the power cable molded to fit perfectly into the back of the computer to leave a flat surface instead of the normal""knobby"" look that computers get around their power cords...",0
"Turning the machine on, I heard the familiar Apple chord, and it started right up.",0
"Seeing a welcome screen in several languages, I proceeded to fill in the little forms to register the machine...",0
The last week has been a blur.,0
The Dual G5 isn't just fast.,0
It's *fast*.,0
"I can rip entire CDs to MP3 in approximately four minutes, and according to the CPU Monitor I'm not even maxing out the processors.",1
"The Box, or"" What's With the Giant Cheese Grater On Your Desk?""",0
More than one reviewer has suggested that the G5 with its front and back surfaces covered in holes looks like a giant cheese grater.,0
"I don't see that close a resemblance, myself - it looks more like a speaker grille to me.",0
"There are so many holes in the case that I understand the actual surface area to be reduced by about 35 % - 65 % of it is aluminum, and the front and back are 35 % holes.",0
"The gorgeous aluminum case for the G5 houses three available PCI-X slots, the AGP slot, dual processors, a SuperDrive ( DVD-R, CD-R, etc., all in one unit ) and a 160GB hard drive.",0
"The back panel includes ports for USB 2.0, FireWire 400, FireWire 800, optical digital audio in and out, analog audio in and out, Gigabit Ethernet, a phone port for the modem, and two little connectors for internal Bluetooth and Airport Extreme.",0
"( Bluetooth is only available as a build-to-order option, and cannot be added internally post-purchase. )",1
Also on the back panel is the latch to open the case - which is padlockable.,0
A little metal tab folds out through the latch to provide a padlock hasp.,0
"Much more effective than the Kensington"" security slot,"" I'm sure.",0
"The front panel has the power switch, a headphone jack, USB 2.0 and FireWire 400 ports.",0
No longer do I have to reach around the back of a machine or USB hub to plug in my CompactFlash card reader to download pictures from the digital camera.,1
Nor do I have to fumble around trying to connect a FireWire cable behind the machine to capture video.,1
"The Fans, or"" The Sounds of Near-Silence""",1
"The Power Macintosh G5 has multiple"" cooling zones"" inside the machine.",0
Remember all of those holes in the front and back?,0
"They're designed so that air can move from the front of the machine to the back and out in a""laminar"" flow.",0
"This means reduced turbulence inside the machine, resulting in better airflow - and quiet.",0
"Turbulence means noise, too.",0
"You can remove the aluminum side panel to look inside the box while it's still running, but if you remove the clear plastic air deflector, the machine will automatically go to sleep so that it doesn't overheat.",0
"I've heard stories from other people who say that the fans will cycle up and down, and get very loud - I set the machine to""fastest,"" and the fans stay on all the time, and the box is still quieter than my old Dual G4 was ( and it wasn't a WindTunnel/Mirrored Door Mac, either! )",1
Even the SuperDrive spinning up to rip a CD to MP3 is louder than the fans are.,0
"Music, or"" I Paid $ 3000 For A 3"" Radio Shack Speaker?!?""",0
"The G5's internal speaker is, well, wimpy.",0
That's the best I can say about it.,0
"Additionally, the G5 no longer supports the Apple Pro Speaker connector, so I can't use the Griffin ProSpeaker Cable to connect speakers to the machine.",1
"On the other hand, the optical digital audio out port means I can plug the G5 directly into a Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound amplifier or receiver, and have more audio wattage than I know what to do with.",0
The analog audio-out port is also available to plug in a regular set of powered speakers.,0
"Video, or"" Prepare For Warp Nine""",0
"The Dual G5 comes standard with an ATI Radeon 9600, 64MB of VRAM, dual output connectors... yes, you can connect two monitors to the same video card.",0
"The two connectors are the ADC, or Apple Desktop Connector, which supports Apple monitors with built-in USB hubs, and a DVI connector for other industry-standard LCD flat panel screens.",1
"The ADC connector itself supports the power and USB signal to the monitor, while the DVI connector provides nothing but video signal.",0
"Apple thoughtfully includes a DVI-to-VGA adapter in the box so one can connect a non-DVI flat panel screen ( like the Samsung 171S), as well as regular HD-15 VGA monitors.",0
"Expansion Slots, or"" What Do I Do With My Old Keyspan SX Pro Serial Card?""",0
The PCI-X slots in the G5 only support 3.3v signaling.,0
"This means that a rather significant number of PCI cards will not even fit into the slot, let alone function.",1
"So, I need to upgrade from the old Keyspan SX Pro to a four-port USB-to-Serial adapter in order to connect my other machines' console cables.",0
"There are eight memory slots in the G5, two of which are occupied when you buy it.",0
"This makes for a current limit of 8GB of RAM, assuming you remove the original RAM and replace it with eight 1GB modules ( 2GB modules are supposed to become available, but I haven't seen any yet ).",1
This doesn't even come close to the maximum RAM addressable by the processor.,0
"With more RAM, the machine doesn't have to swap things in and out of virtual memory ( located on the hard disk ) and will be even faster than it was in the first place.",0
There's one extra slot inside the machine for an additional Serial ATA hard drive.,0
That's right - only two possible slots for hard drives.,0
"But since Serial ATA drives come in flavors up to 200GB or more, do you really need that much storage space?",0
"The Goodies, or"" Not ANOTHER One-Button Mouse!""",1
The G5 comes with a very nice keyboard and mouse.,0
"It is, unfortunately, yet another clear-bodied""one-button"" Apple Optical Mouse.",0
"I never even unwrapped the mouse, opting to install my Kensington Turbo Pro Trackball and Nostromo SpeedPad n50 as my input devices.",1
( Bonus: The Nostromo driver no longer kernel panics the machine! ),1
"Software Compatibility, or"" The Upgrade Race""",0
"So far, I've been lucky.",0
I have yet to find any of my current software rendered useless by moving to the G5.,0
"Virtual PC, on the other hand, is something that a number of my friends and acquaintances depend on for specific applications.",0
The G5 simply won't run it - yet.,0
"Supposedly, an upgrade is on the way, but since it will require a ground-up rewrite of the application, I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it.",0
( Knock on wood ) I haven't even managed to crash this one yet.,0
Mac OS X 10.2.8 ( G5 ) is the most stable iteration I've seen yet.,0
Speed - Enough Said,0
Have I mentioned how fast this machine is?,0
"In the course of writing this review, I've also ripped another 13 CDs to MP3, dumping them into the iTunes library.",0
"While ripping CDs, I've also been using iChat AV to talk to a friend of mine (using the iSight FireWire camera - a slick little piece of hardware! ) and writing at the same time.",0
It's fast,0
I only wish Apple were as fast at building and shipping these speed demons!,0
bought my Calphalon Non-stick pan because I believed that you must have at least one non-stick in your kitchen.,0
I picked this product because I figured for the price I was getting a top quality product that would last.,0
My pan lasted less than a year.,0
It was never the same after I burned pancakes on it.,1
The accident left a round burnt mark on my pan that I could not get rid of.,1
Then the pan lost it's non-stick luster and everything I cooked adhered to the pan.,0
Very frustrating if your trying to make omelettes.,0
"Besides burning the pancakes, I always handwashed it, and only during the pancake incident did I cook it at high heat.",0
"Ok, I'm not perfect, but products should be a little forgiving through one mistake.",1
"Eventually, I gave my pan up to Goodwill and good riddance to a poorly made product.",0
"Later, I received the Farberware Non-Stick pan as a gift and even though the quality ( weight and style ) is not like the Calphalon, that pan has lasted me more than 2 years and I have not encountered the same problems as I have with Calphalon.",1
"I bought a 12"" fry pan.",0
"After using it for a few months, I take issue with the manufacturer's claim that it is non-stick.",0
"It is no more non-stick than a pan with a finely polished stainless steel surface (eg, All-Clad ).",1
Cleaning the pan will often entail the use of stainless steel scouring pad ( provided with the pan ) and a fair amount of energy.,0
My other gripe is the shallow sides of the pan.,0
"I like to toss fast-cooking vegetables in the pan, to ensure they don't burn.",1
"Mind you, the pan is very heavy, so shaking it is quite aerobic, for those of you who don't exercise enough.",1
"However, between the shallow sides and the weight, it's a chore to toss the pan's contents around without launching a bit of it across the stove.",1
"On the plus side, its heft seems to contribute to its even cooking.",0
"I also like the tall, see-through cover",0
I bought this pan and the two-quart saucepan and a saute pan in the same line when I first upgraded my cookware.,0
I found that they all performed well.,0
"They are heavier than most mass-market cookware, make good contact with the electric burner, and they cook with quick, even heat compared to the lighter mass-market items.",0
"The plastic handles are a bit bulky for small hands and harder to clean than straight steel handles, but they seem well-built and do provide excellent heat insulation.",0
"Though I'd never wished I had them in my old pans, the pouring spout was a nice touch.",1
"In all, this was a nice pan to use when it was new.",0
"It wasn't long, however, before my cooking style left its mark on these pans, literally.",1
"I knew not to use a metal spoon in the non-stick pans, so I used plastic and wooden spoons.",1
"Still, the non-stick surfaces of the saucepans are scratched enough that they aren't as non-stick as they used to be.",1
"The saute pan has fared better with the use of plastic and rubber spatulas, and only occaisional plastic or wooden spoons.",0
"Also I tend to bang the handle of the spoon on the rim of the pan to clear it of sauce, and this has left little dents along the inside of the rim.",0
"Lastly, hot oil stains the outside finish of these pans.",0
"Cleanup requires some care, too.",0
"While the interior of the pans is easy to clean, being non-stick, you still must remember to not use the scouring side of the sponge on the interior, according to the instructions.",1
"These pans are not dishwasher-safe, which isn't an issue with me since I don't use one.",1
Note that the Kitchen Essentials line is not Calphalon's best line and perhaps the professional lines are more durable.,1
"I can't recommend non-stick sauce pans, however, and the annodized exterior finish of the Kitchen Essentials non-stick line is difficult to keep looking good.",1
Do your sauces stick to your stainless or aluminum pans?,0
"If not, perhaps you don't need non-stick sauce pans.",1
"Note that the hot spots you get with thin, steel pans that cause some food to burn and stick may be the fault of uneven cooking, or heat that is too high, and not necessarily the surface of the pan.",1
"Uneven heat is solved with better, heavier pans.",0
They don't necessarily need to be non-stick.,1
"I still use the saute pan to cook felafel patties or similar without oil, but the sauce pans have been replaced with tri-ply pans with stainless steel cook surfaces and exterior finishes.",1
They've proven to be much more durable and easier to clean.,0
"One of those"" when I get around to it"" household projects many of us think of when Spring Cleaning rolls around, is the organization and streamlining of our kitchen utility drawer.",0
"Often times this drawer becomes a catch-all for a number of dubious utensils, twisty-ties, rubber bands, little packets of spice mixes and soy sauce and other less savory items I'd rather not think about.",0
"In California's San Joaquin Delta region, peat dirt islands which help to make up the Riparian feature known as 1,000 Miles Of Waterways, alternately flood and serve to provide the ideal growing medium for one of local agribusinesses major vegetable crops, the asparagus.",0
"For many consumers, this King of Spears is only known as a canned product, to be served chilled, in aspics, ( feh! ), or salads.",0
"Others, encountering the raw variety with its woody base, scaled stalk and feathered head, may be unsure just what to do with it.",0
"Which leads me to this niche tool, someone's clever idea, when to my mind a simple 4"" paring knife or slightly larger utility knife would do.",0
Cooking.com Stainless Steel Asparagus Peeler and Tongs,0
"Cooking.com is a fine website, with all sorts of pots and pans and baking supplies.",0
"Like many more esoteric cooking supplies companies, this site offers a mind-boggling array of single-use cooking tools.",0
Such as this one.,0
"Pluses include relative low cost, and easy care stainless steel.",0
Three finger grips make this feel vaguely like a cross between a pair of scissors and tongs in the hand.,0
"A separate blade serves to peel off those nasty purplish and papery scales from the stalks, and does this with dispatch.",0
"There's no need for your hands to touch the blade, and even people with impaired eye sight, ( thinking of my elderly parents here, who were'gifted' with this contraption, touted as perfect for people who have everything ), can make safe use of this 7"" gadget.",1
"The 5"" tongs are cunningly shaped like a pair of asparagus spears, and joined on one end.",0
"There are some nooks and crannies that require a bit of extra cleaning, and a bottle brush could be put to good use here.",0
"The tongs supposedly adjust to lift, remove and transport a variety of spear diameters, but did not work on the pound of freshly steamed"" jumbo"" spears one of my Dad's Island buddies gifted us with just this past month.",1
"I found no benefit to using these tongs over the usual variety of open or solid metal""pincher"" type tongs you can find in an housewares section of local department stores.",1
"The very short length actually works against these tongs, as your hand is exposed to more steam, and conducted heat than with a longer, ( standard 9"" to 12"" ), pair of kitchen tongs.",0
This is especially true if you use the tall inserts that most cookware brands tout as asparagus steamers.,0
My advice?,0
"You will do just as well, if not better, with the sort of small knife mentioned above, a standard, swivel peeler, ( the Oxo cushion-handled one is dandy ), and garden-variety kitchen tongs, probably already in your cooking arsenal.",1
Save the $ 7.50 plus shipping/handling charges from this Internet shopping site for something better-like maybe a luscious box of chocolates!,0
"I met up with Calphalon cookware way back in 1986, when I worked for Williams-Sonoma, the King of Kitchen stores!",0
"As an avid cook, I tried it and many other types of cookware, myself--and I have continued trying out various Calphalon pieces as they come out.",0
"As you would expect, we sales associates were bombarded with a ton of product literature on all of the different cookware lines ( Le Creuset, Cuisinart, etc. ) and we were expected to absorb and memorize the benefits and features of each brand of cookware...BUT, I liked the extra selling edge of being able to tell customers what I had thought after USING each item...so I cooked a lot of things in Calphalon pots--just to test them out!",0
"I regret to say that I felt then, and still feel Calphalon is highly over-rated.",0
I had to revise my whole way of cooking because the black anodized aluminum surface of Calphalon heats a lot hotter and faster than regular cookware.,0
"It is very easy to quickly ruin your food, set off the smoke alarm, and scrub your head off just trying to remove the stuck-on remains.",0
( Yes-Calphalon sticks... ),0
"I was also disappointed in the""artsy"" design of the pots...interesting shapes, but HOT metal handles!! Calphalon brags that their cookware is""oven-safe,"" but those handles make it impossible to use the oven feature without getting 3rd degree burns.",1
"The non-solution for that problem was manufacturing suede covers for the handles, which are pricey and slide off without too much warning.",1
"I don't mind paying premium price for good cookware, but it has to be much better designed that Calphalon!",1
I can't recommend buying Calphalon.,1
I went on a Calphalon Hard-Anodized Cookware a few years back.,0
The pots looked great.,0
"They seemed to say"" the owner of these pots has class.""",0
"However, after using them for a while, I went back to less-expensive non-stick cookware for most jobs.",0
The Calphalon pots are heavy and hard to clean.,0
And you can't put them in the dishwasher--they'll get white spots on them ( I tried with one small piece. ),1
"However, the very heavy aluminum does work better for some purposes.",0
"For example, I use my Calphalon when I'm searing fish--I need to get the pan very hot first, and the olive oil I'm using ensures the fish won't stick.",0
"Because the handles are metal, they heat up with the pot.",0
You need a potholder when lifting one of these pots off the stove...and I'm always unsure of my grip when using a potholder to lift a pan with bubbling oil off the stove.,0
"For a quick omelet in the morning, I reach for the budged non-stick.",0
"Only for special dishes which reqire a hot, smooth, evenly heated surface do I use the Calphalon.",0
We got two pieces of hard-anodized Calphalon for our wedding: the 2.5 quart saucepan with lid and the wok.,0
At the time it seemed like a good idea.,0
"We didn't want anything with a nonstick coating, but we also didn't want to spend hours scrubbing pots.",1
"Calphalon, with its sturdy anodized finish, appeared to be a good compromise.",0
"The heavy aluminum core, we figured, would keep things from burning.",0
Then we opened the boxes and read the directions.,0
"Don't use metal utensils, they said.",0
Don't place your Calphalon on more than medium heat.,1
Don't leave food in it.,1
And don't use a scouring pad.,1
If we'd wanted to baby our pans like this we would have gotten Teflon!,0
"We did our best but it wasn't long before the pans, especially the saucepan, were nicked and scratched.",1
They seemed to develop odd filmy stains that couldn't be removed by soaking or scrubbing ( we even cheated and tried a nylon scouring pad ).,0
It's hard to say whether the stains were from cooked-on food or from the slowly-dissolving coating.,0
"If food was left in the pans for any length of time beyond a couple of hours the finish started to wear away, exposing the plain aluminum interior.",0
Calphalon acts... strangely when you put it on a lit burner.,0
"It heats up very slowly and never really gets hot, even if you disregard the warning about higher than medium heat.",1
"This makes it hard to saute things, and stir-frying is especially challenging.",0
"It also takes a long time to cool down, so that even when you take the pan off the burner the food inside continues to cook.",0
"After the finish started wearing away, the aluminum core made things taste funny, not just acidic foods like tomatoes but even boiling water.",1
Not exactly what we had in mind when we asked our relatives for this pricey stuff.,1
"Finally, after less than three years, we were forced to toss the saucepan.",0
"The wok is still with us, but rarely used.",0
So my recommendation is: skip the Calphalon.,0
"For frying and sauteing, get some nice cheap cast iron; it works better and requires just a minor investment of time at the beginning to get it seasoned.",0
"For boiling and stewing, your basic stainless steel, preferably with a heavy aluminum disk on the bottom, will do just fine.",0
"Then take the money you've saved and buy some good knives or a Kitchenaid mixer, or stock up your liquor cabinet.",0
Cheers!,0
"I love to cook and, like most, prefer to use highest quality tools for ease and best results.",0
"I was so happy to"" step up"" to Calphalon about five or six years ago.",0
I did not do any checking around...the choice was made on the recommendation of friends who also are passionate amateurs.,1
"Initially, I babied these pans, even though it seemed a little odd that the supposed choice of professional chefs would require this kind of treatment.",0
"I mean, any time I watch film footage of restaurant chefs, they are banging their stuff around like crazy.",0
Imagine a high volume restaurant dishwasher gently coddling a pan with Dormand low abrasive cleaner.,0
"I, too, used the hideously expensive Dormand cleaner and carefully stacked the pans in the cupboard with towels in between.",0
"Irrespective of this, the finish VERY quickly began to ding and wear.",0
"Had I been a little smarter at the time, I would have demanded my money back on the spot.",0
They have never been easy to clean.,1
They required a great deal of soaking and gentle nylon abrasion over a day or more if something got really stuck.,0
I have never been happy with the surface for sauteeing tasks ( although the heating is very even and the pans sit nicely on the burner...the structural integrity is just wonderful ).,1
"Now, the anodization has completely worn off the bottoms of the saucepans ( the most-used pans for everyday ), and is starting to come off the skillets.",0
"After a few years, I gave up completely and now we just stick them in the dishwasher.",0
Who cares??,0
"No matter what we did, they seemed to wear out anyhow.",1
I will never purchase anything again requiring this degree of care.,1
"After reading other Epinions, our next purchase will definitely be All-Clad stainless.",0
"I recently received a heavy, multi-ply stainless steel griddle as a gift, and am so happy with its performance.",0
Thanks for reading and I hope this helps you in your decision.,0
"As someone who loves to cook and enjoys entertaining, I am always trying new recipes.",0
"I have tried many different types of cookware including Revere Ware and T-FAL, both were fine but I wanted to upgrade to""restaurant quality"" cookware.",0
Calphalon was my first choice.,0
The look of it combined with the reputation I was convinced it had made me want it in my own kitchen.,0
I bought it piece by piece.,0
"Knowing which pans I would use most, allowed me to purchase just the ones I wanted, as each went on sale.",0
Some even came with videos on how to cook in it and clean it.,0
"Of course, I, being the chef in my own mind, was sure I did not need to view it, but did just for fun.",1
"As I watched, I saw that I needed to use a ScotchBrite pad ( included with the pan and video ) and was told not to ever use dish liquid or put it in the dishwasher, at that point I began to wonder if these pans were going to be a hassle to clean.",1
"But they looked so beautiful hanging from a stainless steel rack, I figured it would be worth it.",0
As I began cooking with my Calphalon I started to become more and more disillusioned.,0
"This commercial-type, quite expensive cookware was not only a chore to clean due to having to use special""equipment"", but it seemed as though just about everything I created stuck to the pans.",1
"Granted, I was well aware that it was not non-stick, however it truly was incredibly daunting to have to be scraping the bottom and sides of the pan, rather than just stirring the food inside.",1
I found myself using it just for certain types of cooking and for certain dishes.,0
"Basically, I personally am disappointed in the Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized pans.",0
"However, I have recently purchased a Calphalon Hard-Anodized Non-Stick Wok and I love it.",0
It looks beautiful hanging with the others and it used much more.,0
"Recently got married and registered for the obligatory kitchen"" stuff"", including a set of calphalon hard-anodized cookware.",0
"I must say I am underwhelmed, considering how much they cost.",0
-- Cool things about the pots'n pans:,0
*/SYM Glass lids!,0
I didn't know what I was missing with my old target pots and pans.,1
"When cooking, I want to check the status of the food often and the glass lids are a simple but amazingly effective feature.",0
*/SYM The handles don't get hot when the pots are.,0
"*/SYM While they're not dishwasher safe ( see below ), they are amazingly easy to clean, cooked in food does slide right off the surface.",1
*/SYM Very sturdy.,0
"You can't knock it off the stove accidentally, and nothing you do to these pots is going to damage them ( well, except use metal utensils in them:-)",1
-- Not so cool things about the pots'n pans:,1
*/SYM heaaaavy.,0
I have to use two hands to move the larger saucepan when it's full of water.,0
*/SYM Not dishwasher safe.,1
"Aww, shucks.",0
"I've long been one of those people who says"" Hey, why bother scrubbing pots if we have a dishwasher, so what if we can only fit 4 things in before having to reload.."" so I've found this to be a fairly big drawback.",0
"*/SYM You can't use metal utensils in them - I'm lazy, I used to grab a spoon from the silverware drawer to stir.",1
Now I have to use an actual *gasp* plastic or wooden spoon.,0
*/SYM Cost.,0
$ 200 for a *pot*??,0
"So overall, I'm sure the calphalons are great for professional cooks who are constantly making things that require these heavy duty pots and pans ( the same type of person who probably pays someone else to wash the dishes ), but for the average joe it's probably not worth it.",1
I'd rather buy a set at target and replace it every year for the convenience of being able to put them in the dishwasher and their lighter construction.,0
"The glass lids is the one feature that keeps me using the calph's, so if I ever find a cheaper, lighter, dishwasher safe set with glass lids..",0
"I bought this cookware set because I finally graduated college, got married and decided that I was finished using the"" cheapies"".",0
I decided on this brand because quite a number of professional chefs I know also have these pans in their home kitchens.,0
I was originally very impressed with the set and loved the design and heaviness.,0
After many uses I have now discovered several items worth mentioning to potential buyers.,0
"First, on the positive side, I must say that the heat distribution is great and this cookware cooks very evenly.",0
"And, as I mentioned before, stylistically they are quite lovely to look at.",0
They add a touch of class to any kitchen.,0
A problem I have discovered and have been greatly disappointed with is the heat retention and conduction of the handles.,0
I have been burned several times now by grabbing on to the handles which appear to have been designed to avoid just such accidents.,0
I don't know why this occurs but it is a hazard and I have to constantly remember to grab a pot holder before grabbing the handle of the pan or pot.,1
I do A LOT of cooking and this is a huge problem for me.,0
I always wanted professional cookware.,0
Now that I have it - I have the professional burns and scars that come with it!,0
The danger of using this product ( because they are made to conduct heat and distribute it evenly ) is the handles.,0
EVERYTHING on these pots and pans gets hot.,0
Until I became fairly use to this my family thought I was going to lose my hands and fingers while cooking.,0
Don't get me wrong I like the finished product of using my new cookware.,1
"It is just the means to the end that is hard for me to overcome, at least until I get it in my head that the handles are VERY HOT!",0
The food comes out wonderful and takes less time to prepare.,0
But you think it wouldn't matter whether the handles conducted heat evenly!,0
Just do something with those handles so we don't have to have the professional scars that come with restaurant-like food.,0
I've enjoyed cooking with Le Creuset cookware.,0
It's solid.,0
It cooks well.,0
It works.,0
"It's also heavy to the point where the usage is impaired, the enamel coating doesn't last as long as it should for the price, and some of it is just plain ugly ( see especially the flame orange colour ).",1
"And the pans with wooden handles will outlive the handles, another thing not commensurate with the price.",1
"I got rid of most of my Le Creuset in a move -- it is the last cookware you'll ever want if you move a long distance, and the last cookware you'll ever want if you move frequently.",0
"Most of mine was actually inherited, which is a bit of a rare thing with pots and pans, and that says nice things about the quality.",0
"That I parted ways with these particular family heirlooms doesn't, though.",1
"The handles were starting to go, as was the enamel coating which never stuck me as a good idea in the first place; it is only marginally more'non-stick' than uncoated metals.",1
"And it was just too heavy: it worked well to slow-cook a curry, but boiling something that might require draining -- well, forget it.",0
"I did put pieces in the oven, a nice bit of functionality, but they were so unpleasant to take out of the oven that I gave up.",0
"You may enjoy one or two pieces of Le Creuset for things that want to be slowly cooked at a low, constant temperature, and if you are the type to constantly have an unmoving pot ( of soup stock, porridge, anything ) on your stove, this may also be your cookware.",0
"A small pan would probably turn out some lovely sauces, though only in small quantities -- anything much over a quart suffers from the weight problem so much that it's not worth it.",1
"I haven't quite been able to duplicate some of the stews and curries made in the Le Creuset pans, but it's a small price (unlike the retail selling one... ) to pay to be free of pots that were so heavy as to be immobile and unwashable.",1
"Yes, Le Creuset is attractive, long lasting and comes in a variety of lovely colors, and are suitable for most heat sources.",0
"However, as a classically trained chef and manager of a cookshop, I feel that the disadvantages to owning it far outweigh the advantages.",0
"It is obviously extremely heavy on it's own without any food in it, and the price tag is quite hefty as well.",1
"Furthermore, if you should happen to chip or crack it in any way, having it re-enameled is as costly as replacing it.",0
Another problem...what if you decide to redecorate your kitchen and it's color scheme?,0
I suggest that you are far better off with stainless steel or anodised cookware.,0
"They can be found in a variety of price ranges, suitable for all heat sources, and fit in with all color schemes.",0
"I received a Smoothie Elite as a Christmas gift and was mildly appreciative of the gesture, but needed a blender, so I didn't return it.",1
"After using it once, I figured out it would never replace a true blender in my kitchen.",1
Now it's just a prop at my bar.,0
"The 500-watt pulse-power motor with 3 speeds (on, mix, and smooth ) is loud - almost whiney - more so than other blenders.",0
"What does""mix"" and"" smooth"" mean anyway?! Give me high and low and we're talking.",0
56 ounce / 7 cup capacity is quite sufficient.,0
"Unique stir stick breaks up air pockets, increases mixing efficiency.",0
But this thing is a nuisance - just gets in the way.,0
I usually just keep the alternate removable lid center on it.,0
"The dispenser valve serves smoothies without a mess, but keeps on serving when you don't want it to.",1
From day 1 the valve dripped onto the counter after using it once.,0
"It's difficult to clean, as well.",0
You have to disassemble the entire valve - a 15-minute ordeal.,0
The base is oversized and bulky.,0
The owner's manual suggests not using a dishwasher to clean.,1
Great...so much for convenience!,0
As you can see by the title here I'm not a fan of Farberware cookware.,1
Purchased a set in May and it has not held up to its reputation.,1
"I don't know what they are doing or not doing, but this set left a bad experience for me.",1
"Can't go in the dishwasher, can't use oil or sprays in it.",1
It scratches easily and stains and peels.,0
This cookware is not a cooks friend what so ever!! Shipped set back to Meyer corp.,1
"and would you believe they didn't stand behind their"" Lifetime Limited Waranty"" due to their explanation of telling me that is was not defective.",1
"Well if peeling and scratching aren't covered under this""WARRANTY"" after less than 3 months use then I have no clue what is covered.",1
It cost me over $ 15 to return and they send me back the exact set.,0
Is this customer service?,0
Is this what we buy now is use for less than 90 days and throw the cookware away?,0
"If you are considering purchasing this"" stuff"" I'd think twice.",0
It's not worth the price or the hassel,1
Lodge is celebrating 100 years of making pans cast from iron.,0
They even have a special cookbook to go with the Lodge pans which is available at the web site.,0
"Lodge makes the entire pan in a cast ( mold ) which is where the cast name comes from, and the pan is made out of iron.",0
Why should you care about a pan being a cast iron?,0
Well--lots of pans fall apart.,0
Pieces come off.,0
The finish flakes off.,0
That doesn't happen with a pan cast in one solid piece and made of iron.,1
As for the iron--iron has been used for centuries in cooking.,0
It holds up to the heat and it absorbs the heat and cooks evenly.,0
It is not a smooth finish like most pans.,1
It has pores which absorb oil ( which means these pans get better over time ).,0
Also the iron gets in the food ( faint traces ).,0
"This is fine and actually a good thing, since we all need iron in our diet.",0
"If you are anemic, then you might want to consider cast iron for cooking.",0
Lodge makes a variety of sizes from the tiny one you see in the product to picture up to the large size in the picture.,0
I do like the small size for meling butter for popcorn or for frying onions to go on a sandwich.,0
The larger sizes are a problem though due to the weight.,0
Cast iron is heavier than other types of cooking materials.,0
Lodge also has the cookbook plus items like covers for the pans ( though I just use a regular lid ).,0
They have other kinds of pans like a wok and Dutch oven.,0
Actually the 20SK2 is not even pictured for you to look at.,1
It is a two handled huge sized pan.,0
It is 20 inches in diameter and 2 1/4 inches deep.,0
In other words this pan is almost 2 feet across.,0
"Since cast iron is heavy, this pan weighs in at 27 pounds and then more when filled with food.",0
I would suggest the Lodge 3 piece pan set.,0
"That comes with 3 pans that are approx 8, 10, and 12 inches.",0
Those are the sizes I generally use.,0
The small size is nice.,0
The large ones are just too heavy.,0
"If I have to cook those kinds of quantities, then I use a stew pot and make soup or stew or something like that.",0
"For a large skillet meal, I'd go with a lighter weight cookware product.",0
Maybe the model number is a mistake on this item.,0
Note that you see a price of $ 5 to $ 35.,0
"Well, that jumbo Lodge runs almost $ 160.",0
"But this model number is the big pan, and I would not use that order number unless you really do want this really large pan.",1
The only way I could see this pan as a good buy is if you own a restaurant.,0
Even then I don't think you could hire many people who could really handle 27 pounds of pan.,1
"Not only is it hard to move the pan around to cook, it is really hard to wash such a large and heavy pan.",1
Don't give up on cast iron based on this pan.,1
Check out my review and others on other Lodge pans.,0
They really are fabulous pans.,0
Cast iron does require seasoning with lard or crisco ( and not just oil ).,1
You rub that in and then heat the pan on 200 degrees for a couple of hours.,0
A newly seasoned pan is best for meat of deep frying ( they do have a deep fryer in fact but you can use the regular fry pan ).,0
To start with you want to build up the oil base.,0
Then you can cook most anything in the cast iron.,0
"Tomato based products tend to break down the seasoning, but other items are fine.",0
"Although some people do baby the cast iron and scrape out and wipe or use a special sand cleaner, I just wash mine right in the sink.",0
I don't let them sit in the water though as that can cause rust.,0
"If a pan does rust, then just use a brillo pad and rub down.",0
Then reseason.,0
They can be recovered easily as I have had them rust during military transitions when they are in storage for months.,0
Do not buy these spoons if you are looking for a decent product.,1
"Yes these spoons are modestly priced, but the quality is highly lacking.",0
"My first impression, was""what the hell are these""",0
"Upon inspection of the spoons they appear to be a cheap type of""pot metal"" stamping.",0
The finish on most of the spoons was a flat unpolished grey color.,0
The only part of the spoon that was even remotely shiny was the head of the spoon.,0
It looks like a big machine stamped them out and then some poor enslaved Chinese 12 year old was forced to quickly ( and unevenly ) polish just the part of the spoon you put into your mouth.,0
"As was evidenced by each spoon having a very nice""made in China"" sticker on it.",0
"However each spoon on the bottom has unevenly stamped into it the words,"" stainless steel"" which is about the only indication that these are actually stainless steel.",0
To be honest I think that it is stamped there just to make you believe that they are stainless steel and keep you from immediately demanding a refund.,0
We received this Farberware stainless steel set when we got married and found them to be great at first.,0
"However, we did end up having some problems with them.",0
The main problem we had was with the handles coming unscrewed.,0
We kept screwing them back in time after time and they kept loosening up.,0
We ended up having to send three of the pans back for repair--which they did gladly ( we had to pay to ship them for repair ).,0
"So on this note, we were very pleased with the warranty.",0
The other problem we had was with the smallest sauce pan.,0
"One day, we noticed that the lip of the pan was cracking at the top.",0
"Since we had always followed the care instructions, I'm not sure why this happened.",1
"However, we do use babysitters who have used our pans so maybe they caused the problem.",0
Who knows?,0
"But, we are still waiting to get our replacement pan from Farberware since the repair place couldn't repair it.",1
"On a more positive note, I have loved the fact that these pans aren't too heavy.",0
We have some Scanpan 2000 pans that are sooooo heavy ( I know they have some lighter ones now )!,0
"Also, this set seems to have everything you need for basic cooking in the kitchen.",0
The only thing I wish it had was a small omelet pan.,0
I would recommend not placing these pans in the dishwasher.,1
"Although the instructions do say""dishwasher safe,"" I think they will last longer if you wash them by hand.",0
"For the price, I think this is a worthwhile set.",0
"However, you may have some problems like I did.",0
At least the warranty is what they say it is and that gives me more confidence in the product,0
"If you like washing dishes all of the time, this cookware set is for you.",0
"Yes, they cook great and they are classics, probably before the turn of the century!",0
Don't buy if you cook low fat meals as you must use oil to keep everything from sticking.,1
"You can wash in the dishwasher and use metal tools, but I bought non-stick skillets because I was tired of scrubbing and soaking before I put them in the dishwasher.",0
My mom told me the other day that she had a set that she bought before I was born ( 1950's ) and I don't remember ever seeing them.,1
She said because she spent all of her time scrubbing and soaking them so now she uses non-stick.,0
They are great for frying and browning foods but do yourself a favor and purchase some additional non-stick cookware too.,0
When I got married my mother bought me a set of Revere Ware and my mother-in-law bought me a set of Farberware.,0
Each swore up and down that their choice was the best set of dishes on earth.,0
"Well after 4 years of testing, I have to say that my choice is Revere Ware!",0
I found the Farberware to not be so durable.,1
"For starters, the handles fell off two pans.",0
"Second, I dropped a Farberware pan once and it cracked in the rim.",0
"Third, I dropped my farberware skillet and revere ware skillet one day while cleaning.",0
My farberware skillet is now oval not round.,1
My revere ware skillet is just fine.,0
"Fourth, I found that the Revere Ware heats through faster and more evenly.",0
My recommendation to anyone who wants a durable long lasting set of pots and pans - that they choose Revere Ware.,0
My mother has been using her pots for 26 years.,0
They look great and work wonderfully!,0
I've had these for 20 years now.,0
"I always thought they were very good, until I tried All-Clad.",0
I never knew any better.,1
"For novice cooks, these Farberware pans are good, durable, inexpensive, competent products.",0
"For more experienced cooks, well...",0
My biggest complaint is that the sides of the pans are thin stainless steel - the aluminum bottom is just that - on the bottom.,0
"This causes sauces, soups, etc - anything liquid in the pan - to scorch along the outside edge.",0
"Any serious cook will spend the extra cash on All-Clad - at least for a few key pieces, such as a Saute Pan, Fry Pan, and a good Sauce pot.",0
"However, if you need a good set of pots ( starter set? ) and you need a whole set for $ 100 or so, instead of $ 100 per pot, these are very adequate.",0
"Desperately in need of new cookware, I added Farberware to my Christmas",0
list a few years ago.,0
I wanted something that would last and wear well.,0
"To my surprise I received two sets of cookware, one Farberware Classic and the other a brand I'd never heard of called Meyer Bella Cuisine.",1
Both are stainless steel.,0
"While I have enjoyed using the Farberware, I find that the other brand is heavier and nicer to use.",0
For the most part I have put my Farberware away.,0
"Though I didn't personally have to pay for the Farberware, for my money I would go with another brand that is not so expensive.",1
The Farberware is thinner and just feels of lesser quality when you handle it.,0
"Considering the expense that this brand costs, check out other brands.",0
You can find better quality for less money,0
Dear Calphalon ,0
We regret to inform you of the demise of your product.,0
I hope you can take comfort in the fact that it performed bravely under adverse conditions..,0
"In our household, the cooking and clean-up chores fall mainly upon me, THE MAN.",0
"you know, the one who throws everything into the dishwasher.",0
"I don't complain about this chore, it's the hand washing that bothers me.",1

"I can tell you, this has been the subject of many conversations in our house.",0
"My better half claimed that she would hand wash any Calphalon  cookware, but after three days, I figured it was either throw it in the dishwasher, or succumb to the science experiment that had formed in the dregs of the Spanish rice.",0
"In the dishwasher with you, I muttered.",0

"It wasn't the peeled and beaded non-stick surface that bothered me, it was the look in her eyes, like I had just eaten the last Reese's miniature without asking her if she wanted it first.",1

"Until then, I am sincerely Yours Briansdad Dept. of Destructio",0
My wife and I received the wonderful gift of a ten piece set of Calphalon for a wedding present eight years ago.,0
It was a joy to cook with in the beginning.,0
It is now time to trash these pots and pans and buy a new set - a more durable one!,0
Had I known that you cannot put them in the dishwasher - nor can you cook on high heat - I would have pampered this stuff.,1
"No, on second thought, even had I known, I wouldn't have.",0
I don't have the patience to hand wash large skillets and stock pots.,1
I think the replacement set will be a less expensive brand which is much more durable.,0
"And if I have to throw it away, I won't feel as bad.",1
I received this set of Pans three years ago for Christmas.,0
( Was my husband trying to tell me something? ),0
I love them.,0
Mine are hanging from a beautiful copper pan wrack from my ceiling and they still look like new.,0
The wedge of copper between the stainless steel in the bottom of the pan helps the food to heat up faster.,0
It really does...don't leave them alone for a long period of time.,1
I have taken good care of my pans and I am sure that they look like new because of that.,0
I always wash mine by hand.,0
The particles of food in a dishwasher can scratch the surface.,0
"Most spots can safely be removed by Cerama Bryte, a ceramic cooktop cleaner.",0
I also try to use heavy duty plastic or wooden spoons and spatulas because scraping the bottom with a metal utensil will scratch the surface.,0
"If you enjoy cooking with good, heavy duty pans and are willing to take good care of them, then they will definitely be worth the money.",0
"If you don't want to take the time to wash by hand and don't care what your pots and pans look like, you might want to invest in something less expensive.",1
They were the perfect set for me!,0
"The All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Sauce Pan is what I consider the""baby"" of the saucepan line, though there is a 1/2-quart model as well as a one-cup butter warmer.",0
The one-quart pan is about as low as I care to go in the All-Clad limbo I play.,0
Starting Out Small,0
I did not start my All-Clad cookware collection in a small way by any stretch of the imagination.,1
"I bought a set, but I lucked into a low price and couldn't pass on it.",0
"If I hadn't had that kind of luck, I would have started out with the All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Sauce Pan, a dependable, often-used size pan in my kitchen.",1
"Many a""non-gourmet"" meal simmers away in this handy piece of aluminum clad in stainless steel.",0
"When pregnant with my first child, I craved ravioli, and not the home-made or even frozen variety...",1
"Chef Boyardee and I became chummy for many months, and his concoction ( no, I don't want to know what's in it ) simmered to preservative-laden perfection within my All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Sauce Pan.",1
"So too, condensed soup schlogs into this gleaming beauty.",0
Add a can of water and presto!,0
Chicken noodle soup ( in a pinch...,0
and with just a pinch of actual chicken ).,0
"No Way, I'm No Gourmet -- All-Clad Doesn't Belong in My Kitchen",1
"Don't let anyone try to convince you that All-Clad cookware is""yuppy"", for those who have everything, or""out of the regular person's league"".",1
"It's pricey, yes, but beyond that, it can be the cookware that allows you to enjoy cooking.",0
"You just may become a gourmet, if that's the direction you want to go.",0
Why is this All-Clad sauce pan so good?,0
"First, the construction of the All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Sauce Pan is top quality.",0
"The heat conducting metal, aluminum, is at the core of each pan.",0
Surrounding the aluminum is a layer of stainless steel -- inside and outside.,0
"This makes a three-layer, bonded piece of cookware that heats quickly, holds the heat, cooks evenly, and looks fantastic while doing it.",0
"And the part that isn't supposed to heat -- the stay-cool handle -- doesn't get hot, unless you use the All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Sauce Pan in the oven.",1
A short summary of the All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Sauce Pan:,0
 aluminum core for excellent heat conducting purposes,0
 stainless steel surrounding the aluminum core (3-ply construction ),0
 stay-cool handle,0
 oven-safe,0
 energy-saving ( requires lower heat throughout cooking than does other pans ),0
 All-Clad lifetime warranty covering manufacturer's defects,0
What you don't get with this All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Sauce Pan,1
 a lid ( Usually All-Clad saucepans come with a lid.,0
Mine didn't.,1
Lids are available separately for about $ 25.),0
" scorching food, unless left on too high heat for too long",0
"""hot spots"" in the pan that burn or scorch",0
 difficult clean-up...,0
very little elbow grease required,0
What's the Big Deal about This Sauce Pan?,0
"Right now, the big deal is that I bought another one of these for $ 25 as a"" try me"" deal at Amazon.com.",0
"It's a much-used size in my kitchen, and it makes sense for me to have two of them.",0
"At this price, I couldn't pass!",0
"No lid on this one, either, but that's okay ( the regular price on the 1-quart is roughly $ 60 ).",1
"Aside from my luck running over once again, you'll find that the All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Sauce Pan, after getting to know it's abilities on your particular heating elements, won't run over when you're simmering a serving of soup, making a sauce or doing up a vegetable for dinner.",0
"The key to success with this pan, like any other, is to know its capabilities when matched with your cooking appliance, whether it be gas or electric.",0
"I can set a pan of soup on the stove, bring it to a boil and then set it at just about the lowest setting ( gas range ) and know that the soup will just barely simmer.",0
"With my former cookware, I had to adjust the heat often, even after owning the pans for years.",0
I thought something was wrong with me.,0
"I'm not perfect, but those pans were even less so!",1
Is This Pan Right for Me?,0
You have to know your cooking needs before making any cookware purchase.,0
"If you don't make pancakes or grilled cheese, why own a griddle?",1
The same goes for various sizes of pots and pans.,0
"If you have a family of 6 and you rarely make small amounts of anything, the All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Sauce Pan may not be for you.",1
"But for some purposes, like melting butter, making glazes or few-person servings of soups or vegetables, the All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Sauce Pan is the perfect size and you'll use it often.",0
"Other than the sizing issue, there's no question that All-Clad is right -- if you want your cooking endeavors to be easier, more satisfying and deliver more wonderful results than you've ever had, it's not only right, it's the only choice.",1
The All-Clad Limbo,0
"What is the"" All-Clad Limbo""?",0
"Maybe you don't know that tune now, but once you begin seriously contemplating an All-Clad purchase you will.",0
Maybe you're there now.,0
"When you make the purchase of the All-Clad Stainless 1-Quart Sauce Pan and begin to use it, you'll get results with your cooking that make you wonder.",0
"What you'll wonder is, when will you pick up your next piece of All-Clad?",0
"As the"" Limbo"" begins, you begin asking yourself,"" Which piece do I want to get next?""",0
"And the tempo quickens when you see the words"" Sale"" or"" Special Offer"" in conjunction with All-Clad cookware.",0
The beat goes on.,0
Do you hear the music?,0
Like popcorn?,0
"If so youll love ( let me repeat that emphatically, LOVE ) Whirley Pop.",0
My husband and I were given the Whirley Pop for Christmas.,0
"Honestly, we had nt been munching much on popcorn recently because my tiny microwave was on the fritz and refused to work on microwave popcorn.",1
The Whirley Pop entered our lives just in time.,0
"Manufactured by Monon, Indiana-based Wabash Valley Farms, the Whirley Pop can be purchased in three sizes  4 quart, 6 quart, and 8 quart.",0
We were fortunate to have been given the 6 quart popper.,0
The popper looks very similar to a small crock pot with a shiny silver finish and flip-top.,0
"The pot itself is dishwasher safe, while the top can be easily removed and should be washed by hand ( its got wooden handles ).",0
The best thing about the Whirley Pop is just how easy it is to use.,0
You may think that that microwave popcorn is a cinch.,0
"Well, check this out.",0
The Whirley Pop makes twice the amount of popcorn in less than five mines.,0
"Instead of using the microwave, you use your stove set on medium to medium high.",0
Simply add at least at least one teaspoon of oil ( at most half a cup ) and your popcorn ( 1/2 cup at most ) and crank the handle until the popcorn is done popping.,0
Voila! Six quarts of sumptuous theater style popcorn!,0
But the fun part is that you can try different recipes and experiment with different oils and salt-based seasonings.,0
"As long as you dont do anything too strange, your popcorn will turn out perfectly.",1
"The manual that accompanies the Whirley Pop suggests canola, coconut, peanut, and olive oil among others.",0
Salt-based seasonings are readily available at the local supermarket in addition to pre-measured packets available at the Wabash Valley Farms website.,0
"Popcorn can be purchased via that site, or for a better price at the local grocery.",0
"Whirley Pop is easy for children to use, but they must be monitored at all times as popcorn is hot and stoves are even hotter.",0
The Whirley Pop is inexpensive and easy to use when compared to air poppers and other electric popcorn poppers.,0
"At just $ 25 or so, this unique appliance can be yours.",0
"Personally, I intend on purchasing this as a wedding gift when friends get married.",0
"Without a doubt, they wont be returning the Whirley Pop.",1
Its uniquely fun and makes the best popcorn you can imagine.,0
"As an added bonus, it also works over a camp stove.",0
Wabash Valley Farms website: http://www.wfarms.com/,0
Whirley Pop Recipes: http://wfarms.com/lib/wfarms/FreeRecipes.htm,0
"October is national popcorn month, but popcorn rocks year round.",0
"My family ate popcorn all the time when I was growing up, and my boys and I continue that family tradition.",0
"Over the years, Ive used and owned all kinds of popcorn contraptions from the yellow plastic air popper to the metal one that you poke in the fireplace.",0
The hands-down BEST popcorn popper is Whirley Pop.,0
Taste is really the key when you get down to it.,0
"Although microwave popcorn is quick and easy, it has a heavy non-natural taste.",0
"If you look inside the microwave bag and see the sticky mess on the sides of the bag, then you know why this stuff is heavy and why eating a lot of microwave popcorn will make you heavy too.",0
"Stovetop and old metal poppers make decent popcorn, but you have to stay on top of things or you end up with burned corn.",0
"I can make a good pan of skillet corn, but it takes some doing.",0
Dont even get me started on the air poppers.,1
That stuff should be used far packing boxes.,0
My review of the Presto is at www.epinions.com/content_40127532676.,0
Whirley Pop has that soft and light taste that you find in some old movie theatersthe ones where they measure the oil and buy popcorn in bulk bags and not the ones that have handy packages loaded with butter flavored oil.,1
The combination of minimal oil and high heat with the hand crank spinner and air vents mean the corn pops fast and fluffy.,0
"While the kernels are not the steroid version you see in Orville Redenbockers bags, they pop big for real corn.",1
"Although I like plain popcorn best, you can use the base corn from Whirley Pop and make loads of variations.",0
These range from sprinkling cheese on after to mixing up as trail mix or baking a chocolate popcorn treat in the oven.,0
Microwave and air popped corn dont work well for variations.,1
"Any old standard popper or stove pan with lid will make the corn for recipes, but Whirley Pop produces better corn.",0
"If you like to play around with your popcorn, then Whirley Pop includes a nice recipe booklet.",0
They also have a website with free recipes at www.popcornpopper.com.,0
My favorite Halloween project using popcorn is at http://www.epinions.com/content_2209390724,0
"Halloween Scary Hands are easy to make, and even preschool kids can have fun with this easy treat for ghoulies.",0
Im a lazy bum...,0
There are so many options for making popcorn that a complex popper is not going to fly.,1
No one will slave over a popper when those microwave bags are so easy to use.,1
Dont worry.,1
The Whirley Pop is quick and easy.,0
"In fact, you can make popcorn just as fast with the Whirley Pop as you can with the microwave ( if you dont include clean up ).",1
The time runs 4 minutes on average either way you go.,0
Whirley Gig has two main piecesthe bucket and the top with the hand crank.,0
Put 2 tablespoons of oil and  cup of popcorn in the bucket ( or buy the bagged oil and corn combos and pour in ).,0
Snap the lid on.,0
It has two snaps that click on easily.,0
Put the contraption on the stove eye turned to high.,0
"Slowly crank the wooden handle, which is kind of like the crank on an old ice cream bucket.",0
The handle moves the whisk inside and keeps the corn moving around and not stuck to the bottom turning black.,1
Crank faster as the corn starts popping.,0
"When the popping slows down, take the pan off.",0
Open the flip top ( it has two for pouring out the corn ).,0
You have a perfect bowl of popcorn!,0
Another good thing is that you can half the portions and make a small popper of corn.,0
"When the boys are visiting the grandparents, I can still make popcorn and dont end up eating way more than I should.",1
Gee...,0
that was fun!,0
Sometimes I buy those little metal popcorn pans at the grocerythe ones that grow and get bigger as you pop the corn.,0
"Whirley Pop is fun like the growing corn pans, but it s less expensive to use the Whirley Pop and the corn tastes better.",0
"Of course, it s not going to be much fun if someone gets burned.",1
Whirley Pop does get really hot to produce those airy kernels.,0
"The wooden handles dont get hot, but the metal does get really hot.",1
Kids may not remember to hold ONLY the wooden parts.,1
We get around that here by wearing oven mitts from Wal-Mart.,0
Those go way up on Caleb and Elis arms and protect them when they crank.,0
"I handle moving and pouring, but the boys do most of the cranking and have a lot of fun doing that.",0
I would say that kids from ages 8 and up can crank this popper with mitts and supervision.,0
The clean up is no problem.,1
"Whirley Pop can go in the dishwasher, but I dont have one )-: It only takes a few seconds to hand-wash the popper, so that s not a big deal.",1
The corn pops fast and the pan comes out pretty clean.,0
"Traces of oil wipe off the popper, which does nt have serious cracks and crannies requiring serious probing.",1
"I would suggest Dawn dish liquid, which cuts that oil.",0
I used cheaper dish liquid before my drain stopped up.,0
"The plumber said to use Dawn, and I have not stopped the drain up since I switched.",1
"While the small traces of oil from the popper dont cause a problem, the build up over time can plug pipes especially in a southern home where oil is almost a beverage.",1
Im saving money too!,0
Microwave popcorn gets expensive over time.,0
Its much cheaper to pop with Whirley Pop.,0
You can make enough popcorn to feed the whole neighborhood ( or to last a good long time ) for a couple of dollars.,0
"The ready-to-pop bags for Whirley Pop are more expensive, but they still run lower than the microwave bags.",0
The unit costs a little more than some poppers.,0
The going price is about $ 25.,0
A standard metal popper or the air popper go for under $ 15.,0
"Its worth the slight price difference for the better corn, so I did nt mind the cost.",0
"I bought mine at Amazon, and it came with the recipe booklet and 4 bags of the ready-to-pop corn.",0
What are you waiting for?,0
Whirley Pop is terrific!,0
It makes perfect popcorn every time.,0
We have fun making and eating this popcorn.,0
This popper is on my list of great presents to buy for family and friends.,0
"Actually, the first one was planned as a gift, but it rained.",0
"The boys were bored and hungry, so we claimed the Whirley Pop.",0
"Now, it s our favorite, and well have to buy more of these and share the fun.",0
Let me start by making two things very clear.,0
I LOVE POPCORN AND I LOVE MY WHIRLEY POPCORN POPPER!,0
"OK, I bought this popper about six months ago and it was love at first batch.",0
I just finished popping a batch and I am eating it as I write this review.,0
This popcorn is GOOD!,0
Its so easy to make great popcorn with this popper.,0
"If you follow the simple directions that are included, youll make flawless popcorn every time you use this popper.",0
"Thats right, no more burnt popcorn and almost no more un-popped kernels.",1
This is a very high heat popper.,0
Its made of thin aluminum that conducts quickly.,0
Theres a snap on lid that s hinged down the middle to allow one side to flip open so that popped corn can be poured out.,0
The lid has four small incisions that allow steam to escape during popping.,0
This keeps the popcorn crisp and prevents it from becoming too chewy.,0
"During popping, this baby really gets hot and it should not be used by children who have not reached their teen years ( in my opinion ).",1
There is a wooden for holding the popper and it stays pretty cool at all times.,0
There are two small wooden knobs on each side of the lid that also stay pretty cool.,0
Now the thing that really helps this popper make great popcorn is the hand turned paddle.,0
At the end of the wooden pot handle theres a metal crank that has a small wooden knob on it.,0
"When the first kernels of popcorn begin to pop, you have to slowly turn this crank.",0
"This crank turns a gear driven, wire paddle inside of the popper.",0
The wire paddle ( wand ) keeps the popcorn moving and prevents it from sticking to the bottom of the popper.,0
This prevents the popcorn from burning and it gets ever kernel to contact the bottom and pop.,0
Its really a very simple but effective mechanism.,0
There are several different methods of popping but a standard method is to put the oil in the popper and then get it hot before adding the popcorn kernels.,0
The amount and kind of oil to use is strictly dependant upon personal taste and preference.,0
I have found a place locally that sells pre-packaged corn and popping oil that works beautifully with this popper and it s delicious.,0
Corn popped in this popper is much better than microwave popcorn.,0
"Its less greasy, no preservatives, and much healthier.",1
"Pop up a batch, light up the big screen, pop in a good movie, and it s show time!",0
"Oh, I forgot the Miller Light.",0
Cant forget that.,0
Clean up is very easy.,0
The popper lid snaps off and the paddle comes out when the lid is removed.,0
All of the parts are dish washer safe and they can be easily washed by hand with warm soapy water.,0
"One very minor thing to watch out for is; if you use a fair amount of oil to pop, very tiny droplets of hot oil do escape through the lid and they can sting your hand while youre turning the crank.",0
"A cooking mitt or some kind of hand protection would be good, especially for anyone who has sensitive skin.",0
I got this popper for a Christmas gift last year and it has been one of my favorite items since.,0
It consists of an aluminum pan with a snap on top.,0
the top has 2 flaps with steam vents and a handle.,0
The handle turns a stirrer that is attached to the bottom of the lid.,0
The popper if very well constructed.,0
"It is entirely aluminum, feels sturdy and cleans up very easily.",0
"Flat out, this popcorn popper makes some of the best popcorn I've had.",0
"It comes out light and fluffy, and very tasty.",0
Using this popper I can actually make popcorn in shorter time than using a microwave.,0
"It is cheaper, better tasting and faster...what are you waiting for!! Go buy one right now.",0
I got mine from www.popcornpopper.com,0
along with some of their gourmet popcorn and real theater popping oil.,0
I would highly suggest these items to go along with the popper,0
"An All-Clad Stainless Steel Set is worth its weight in gold, and though you might consider it about as costly, it is well worth the investment.",0
"It is truly a""guilty pleasure"" when considering the price you might pay in respect to the delights it holds, once you get it out of the box and onto your range.",0
You don't have to take a chance on All-Clad.,1
"Instead, you can put trust in it ( along with your food ) for all of your cooking needs.",0
"Mismatched, Bargain Basement, Re-Gifted Cookware Steels Me for Making a Decision ( and a"" Going out of Business"" Sale Makes It Easier )",0
I began my kitchen career ( I am an amateur ) at my mother's elbow.,0
"I admired her copper-bottomed Revereware from my earliest recollections, and hoped I would have a set of it one day.",0
"It looked beautiful, and my mother's cooking was always delicious.",0
"Well, now I know my mom is really good, because I got my set of Revereware ( from her and Dad as a wedding gift ) and I used it for years, scraping and scrubbing at scorched spots, soaking and slaving over baked-on scraps and generally wondering how she managed to keep her cookware looking good, and wondering even more how she turned out great food.",0
I supplemented my Revereware with odds and ends from sales at department stores and sometimes received gifts from good-intentioned givers...,0
finding a card in the wrappings to the giver from someone else is quite an interesting occurrence.,0
"Nice, uh...",0
thought?,0
"After several years, I had quite an eclectic collection, none of which I could call""favorites"".",1
I tolerated my cookware.,0
"I used it, but I did not enjoy it.",1
Not a good thing for someone who loves to cook and experiment with ingredients and recipes.,1
How All-Clad Slipped into My Cabinets,0
"Okay, I'll admit it.",0
My first All-Clad purchase was a big one ( set-wise ).,0
"A local kitchen store advertised a closing sale, and I went to look at the leftovers.",0
Color me stainless...,0
there was a 9-Piece All-Clad Stainless set sitting in a corner for the rock bottom price of $ 275.,0
"At the time, I knew little about the pricing, but figured this was a pretty good deal ( what an understatement! ).",0
Turned out to be more than 50 % off of the retail price.,0
It's always nice to have your guilty pleasure at cut-rate cost.,0
And slip into my cabinet it did.,0
"I was consumed with guilt for making the purchase, because Husband of Mine, as considerate as he is, sees no logic in spending hundreds of dollars on pots and pans.",1
Don't we already have some?,1
"They work, don't they?",1
Why buy new ones?,0
"This question does not apply in reverse, when implying that his sports card collection grows in leaps and bounds and""don't'we' already have one of that guy?""",1
The same rules don't apply.,0
"So, my 9-piece set of All-Clad remained a truly hidden guilty pleasure for several weeks while I worked up the courage to reveal it.",0
How can it be a guilty pleasure if you don't use it?,1
"Heck, I found pleasure in simply knowing it was there and knowing it would make a difference in my kitchen...",0
"also, I removed a piece or two to admire and""practice"" while the"" Cat"" was away...",0
Revealing the Objects/NNPS|VBZ of My Guilt,0
I admitted my guilt under the guise of preparing Husband's favorite meal on our gas range: Chicken Parmesan.,0
"The idea for unveiling my guilty pleasure was rather last-minute, and the 9-Piece All-Clad Stainless set just seemed to present itself in filling out the menu.",0
"I made use of every single one of the nine pieces for this fabulous dinner, and it was fabulous for several reasons, not including the finished product, which I'll detail as I go along.",1
"I turned up the flame under the 10"" Fry Pan to pan-fry the breaded chicken filets for this dish.",0
"When I dropped a bit of water into the pan and droplets jumped out, I added the filets and watched them brown nicely, evenly and expertly...",0
all I had to do was turn them once and watch.,0
"I didn't have to hang onto the pan handle for dear life to turn the chicken, either.",1
"The pan""let go"" of the food easily ( pre-heating helps this effect -- better than non-stick ).",0
"When I did touch the handle to remove the pan from the heat it was still room temperature, after almost 15 minutes on medium-high heat, thanks to the stay-cool handle.",0
Most amazing for me was that I didn't have to promenade the chicken around the pan to get each piece cooked evenly without one browning too quickly and the others not enough.,1
"I'm surprised I remembered to continue with the remaining elements of the meal, as awed as I was with this experience.",0
"Into the oven with the 10"" Fry Pan to keep warm ( All-Clad stainless is oven-safe, lids, too! ).",0
"A few servings of sugar snap peas had the honor of simmering for several minutes in the 2-Quart Sauce Pan w/ Lid, before being slotted-spooned away to a serving bowl with a bit of butter.",0
"I found that medium-low heat kept the water at a simmer, just on this side of boiling.",0
"The 3-Quart Saut Pan w/Lid expertly sauted onion, celery, green pepper and garlic for the thick sauce Husband has come to expect with this meal.",0
"In order to simmer and reduce the sauce a bit, knowing I was on the clock, I made use of the wide, flat expanse of the saut pan rather than a larger pot requiring more cooking time for the same results.",0
"Larger pan, more heat.",0
Right?,0
Nope.,0
"The sauce simmered nicely, uncovered on low.",0
A stir now and then was all the work.,0
"No scorching, no hot spots, just thickening sauce.",1
I had the pasta water on to boil and covered until just before serving time in the 6-Quart Stock Pot w/Lid.,0
"Ten minutes before serving dear Husband of Mine"" The Meal"", I popped the pasta in the pot and let it roll... the only down side to this piece of equipment is that I did not have a pasta insert ( still don't...",1
maybe soon? )!,0
"Now, because Husband of Mine isn't always the most observant of men and might not notice the gleaming All-Clad on the stove top when passing through the kitchen to the dining room, I made use of the 3-Quart Casserole w/lid( 8"" X 3"" ) on this occasion as a serving piece -- layering pasta, sauce, chicken and cheese in it, placing the lid on and delivering it to the table as a functional centerpiece.",1
"Also, I needed a"" story-starter"" to introduce the newest additions to our family.",0
You Said a Mouthful,0
"Well, dear Husband made his way to the table, sat, and looked over the offering before him.",0
"I, opposite him and nervous, yet giddy with my newfound"" Superb, Efficient, Conspicuous Restaurant Equipment Treasury"" ( SECRET, for short ), gazed hopefully at him...",0
Nothing.,0
"I removed the lid from the casserole... the shining, stainless, brand-new All-Clad casserole, adding a flourish and cocking the lid against the salt and pepper shakers so that my mate could see his reflection in it if he so desired.",0
Still nothing.,0
We went about filling our plates and I tried to be nonchalant.,0
"Clearly I pulled it off, because aside from a comment about how much he enjoys Chicken Parmesan, Husband of Mine seemed not to notice a thing and was his usual silent self.",1
"Toward the last few bites, he did say,"" This is really good.",0
And it's always good..,0
"but this is better.""",0
That's all I needed to hear.,0
How Much Did We Save?,0
"Weeks later -- months, actually, after enjoying the company of my 9-Piece All-Clad Stainless set in the kitchen, turning out better-than-before versions of everything in my repertoire not only easier but with a completely different and more controlled feel in the process, Husband noticed the 3-Quart Saut Pan w/Lid.",1
"He walked into the kitchen as I put together my"" Saturday Scramblette"" ( it changes names, depending on the day of the week ), stopped in his tracks and said,",0
""" When did we get that?""",0
casting a wary eye on the saut pan.,0
""" Months ago,"" I replied innocently.",0
""" Oh.",0
"How much did we save on this particular purchase?"" he returned, a little snidely.",0
"I told a partial truth,"" A little less than $ 300.""",0
"He continued on his way, and never asked again.",1
I either confused him or impressed him.,0
"If I want to know which, I'll have to divulge my SECRET to him, and I won't have this guilty pleasure to hold dear any longer.",1
I'll Let You in On the SECRET,0
"All-Clad stainless steel cookware is many things in the kitchen: solid, high-performance, sturdy, oven-proof, versatile, and beautiful.",0
"Hide it if you have to or hang it on a rack for all to see -- which I would if my long, narrow kitchen would allow it.",0
We're planning to remodel one of these days...,0
I wonder if local contractors have ever planned kitchens around cookware before?,0
Each piece of All-Clad comes with a lifetime warranty against manufacturer's defects.,0
"I have not had to make use of the warranty, and can't imagine needing to do so.",1
"The stay-cool ( and they do stay cool on the stove top ) handles are double-riveted to the sides of each piece, as are handles on the lids, and each piece ( pot, skillet or pan -- any piece that may rest on a heat source ) is of three-ply construction: a core of aluminum ( to conduct even, lasting heat ) coated on both sides by polished stainless steel for beauty, ease of cleaning and non-reactivity with all foods.",0
"Everything about this cookware says"" solid"".",0
"And the lids ( one for each pot and pan except for the 10"" skillet in this set ) are made of solid stainless steel, too.",0
"Great stuff, All-Clad.",0
"And when you lift a piece of it, you'll know it.",0
"The long, angled handles of the All-Clad sauce pan and saut pan balance perfectly with the weight of the pans themselves.",0
"This means they have good""heft"".",0
I'll vouch for that.,0
"My Revereware had no heft, or at the most, unmeasurable heft -- meaning that anytime I filled a pot with food, I had to do some work to hold the pot at the right angle to keep from spilling it when moving from the stove to the table or counter.",1
I could never get enough strength in my forearms to cart food-laden vessels with handles around the kitchen without clutching the handle with two hands or gripping the other side of the pot none-too-gracefully.,1
"Large pieces, like the 3-quart saut pan offer a loop handle opposite the long handle, for carrying convenience.",0
"Nice touch, and very helpful, especially when pouring sauce from the pan to a platter or bowl.",0
Cleaning?,0
No Secrets Here,1
"Feel free to place All-Clad Stainless in the dishwasher, or if you prefer, as I do, hand wash it in the sink.",0
Regular dishwashing liquid and a soft cloth will work just fine.,0
"If you find something baked on, a simple soaking should allow easy removal.",0
"Plastic scouring pads are fine for use, but do not use an abrasive cleaning pad or cleanser.",1
"Not only do you not need them, they will dull the finish of the cookware.",1
"If you find a trouble spot, or want to polish up your All-Clad set to its original luster, break out a can of"" Bar Keeper's Friend"" ( BKF).",0
"A gently cleanser, BKF buffs the surface of the stainless steel, eliminating possible stains and restoring the gleam to your cookware.",0
"It works like magic ( and removes rust, should you have any rust-prone gadgets in your kitchen -- All-Clad WON'T rust! ).",1
"Should you accidentally leave a pot or pan on the heat too long and come back to a scorched panful of food, empty what you can, fill the pot with water and a few teaspoonfuls of baking soda and set the water to boil.",0
Allow a full boil for a few minutes and the scorched food should come away from the pan quite easily.,0
No kidding.,1
This happened to me when making a boiled icing base a few years ago.,0
"I doubted that blackened flour and milk would give up easily, but the mess literally peeled away from the sides and bottom of the pan with this method.",0
"Don't Keep It to Yourself, Unless You Want To",1
"Though Husband of Mine is enlightened about All-Clad, he doesn't buy it.",1
"He doesn't cook, so he can't appreciate the comparison between my old cookware and All-Clad, and he doesn't purchase pieces for me because he doesn't know what price is good or what piece might be best to add next.",1
"I've offered to make him a list, in order of""need""...",0
"His unwillingness to supply my guilty pleasure lets me still feel"" secretive"" about All-Clad, going about admiring pieces in stores with a wistful look and a hopeful gleam in my eye...",0
"wondering when I might smuggle home this or that ( after paying at the register, of course ).",0
"What will make it's way, under wraps, to my kitchen remains to be seen, but rest assured, it will be nothing short of All-Clad.",0

ENJOY!,0
Have you ever bitten into a gritty piece of lettuce in your salad?,0
Yuck!,0
"I've discovered the absolute BEST way to clean your greens and keep them hydrated, crisp and fresh.",0
Let me introduce you to the OXO Pump Action Salad Spinner.,0
~ What is it and How Does it Work?,0
"The OXO Salad Spinner consists of a large, clear, heavy-duty plastic bowl, measuring about 10 1/2"" in diameter and about 6"" high, a white plastic open weave basket that fits inside the bowl, and the pump action top/lid.",0
"To use, rinse your greens under cold running water, and then place them in the basket.",0
Put the basket containing the greens into the clear plastic bowl.,0
Put the pump action lid on top to cover the bowl.,0
The pump top has a simple locking tab that keeps the push-down pump compressed and flush to the lid for storage.,0
"To unlock, just slide the lock back.",0
It's very easy to do.,0
"The pumper then pops up and extends above the lid about 3"" or so.",0
Then just push down on the pumper.,0
"The basket inside the bowl spins, and water is extracted from the greens out of the basket, away from the greens, and out into the bowl.",0
Push the pumper down a few times to keep it spinning and allow the centrifugal force to extract the water.,0
"You don't need to push more than maybe four to six times, but trust me, you'll probably keep pushing because it's so much fun!",1
"The pumper has a really neat wide, rubber-like non-slip top that you push down.",0
"It is easy on your hands, and very easy to push.",0
It doesn't take a lot of pressure at all.,1
The basket spins smoothly and quietly.,0
There is also a brake button on top of the lid.,0
Just press the black rubber brake button to stop the spinning.,0
"The bottom of the bowl has a non-skid surface, which helps to keep the bowl steady as the basket spins.",0
"I've got it going pretty fast a couple of times, and the bowl will move a little bit, but it's not a problem.",1
You can use this on any convenient surface.,0
"After you're done playing - er, I mean cleaning your greens, take out the basket with the greens and empty out all the water from the bowl that was extracted from your greens.",0
"You can then store the greens in the refrigerator in a ziplock bag, which is what I usually do.",0
"Or, if you'd like you can even store the greens right in the Salad Spinner bowl.",0
The Salad Spinner is easy to clean.,0
"The plastic bowl is top-rack dishwasher safe, but since it primarily only has water in it, I just rinse and dry.",0
"The whole unit it light weight, uses no electricity or batteries.",1
"~ My Experience, Tips, and Other Notes",0
"I've found that a full head of iceberg lettuce must be broken into wedges, or in half, depending on the size of the head, before it will fit into the basket.",0
And of course to adequately wash and rinse a head of lettuce it's best to break it up anyway.,0
"You can rinse your lettuce, then fill the Salad Spinner bowl with water and let it soak for a little bit.",0
"Then rinse again, and place the greens into the basket and spin.",0
"This will really get your greens super clean, very hydrated, and after chilling they will be crisp and delicious.",0
"Remember, don't use a metal knife to cut your lettuce up though, because the edges will turn brown.",1
"Always tear your lettuce by hand to avoid browning, or use a special""lettuce knife.""",0
"The greens I've washed and then put in the OXO Pump Action Salad Spinner are the tastiest, crispiest greens I've ever had.",0
"And I swear, it is so easy and fun to use this handy tool!",0
"If you have children who want to help, this is a perfect task for them.",0
The Salad Spinner bowl by itself is a perfectly nice bowl that can be used for many other things as well.,0
You can of course store the greens or serve the finished salad in the bowl.,0
"Try it for serving popcorn, potato chips, or snacks as well.",0
I found my OXO Salad Spinner at Target for $ 24.99.,0
The only possible drawback I can see to this wonderful kitchen tool is storage.,0
It's a big bowl that will hold about 4 quarts.,0
But finding a spot for this is worth it.,0
"You'll have the cleanest, tastiest, crispest greens, and it's just so darned much fun to use! Go take it for a spin!",0
eating since we purchased them.,0
"We have used metal spoons, whisks, spatulas and tools of all kinds.",0
"Through it all, not only have they continued to cook wonderfully, but they look good too",1
All-Clad is the best cookware I have ever used!,0
My wife and I purchased our first All-Clad saucepan with a gift certificate we received when we were married.,0
"Ever since then, we couldn't wait for the day when we could replace our entire collection of old and worn pots and pans with nothing but All-Clad.",1
"A year later, we finally purchased the Stainless Steel Nine-Piece Set and we couldn't be happier.",1
Here is what the set we purchased contains:,0
" 10"" Non-stick Fry Pan",0
 2 Quart Sauce Pan w/Lid,0
 2 Quart Saute Pan w/Lid,0
 3 Quart Sauce Pan w/Lid,0
 6 Quart Stock Pot w/Lid,0
Cooking on All-Clad is a joy.,0
"Things cook well, fast and evenly.",0
There is one modification one must make to their cooking style though.,0
KEEP THE HEAT DOWN for sauting.,0
"Following that rule, we have never had a problem with sticking - no matter the recipe.",1
From fried and seared fish to Chicken Dijon - they all turn out perfectly ( provided the cook doesn't make any mistakes! ).,1
"Everything cooks easily, rapidly, and clean up is breeze.",0
The full length handles NEVER get hot.,1
"Because of the nature of the shiny stainless steel surface, if you expect to keep your All-Clad in its"" as new"" shiny condition, it's important to clean it well inside AND out after every use.",0
"That being said, we managed to leave a lid on a hot burner one night.",0
"Fortunately, my wife picked it up with an oven glove but it left a rather large amount of burned oven glove stuck to it.",0
"With a good amount of scrubbing, even that came off, leaving the lid looking as good as new.",0
Our All-Clad have taken a real beating since we purchased them.,0
"We have used metal spoons, whisks, spatulas and tools of all kinds.",0
"Through it all, not only have they continued to cook wonderfully, but they look good too",1
It all started some 20 years ago.,0
"My dad bought his mother-in-law, my Nana, a big shiny fry pan.",0
He bought the best the store had to offer and that was All-Clad.,0
"It was a smart buy then, and remains one today.",0
That big sucker of a fry pan somehow ended up in my house along the way.,0
It now hangs prominently in my kitchen.,0
"Not merely as a coveted heirloom, but as a trusty pan that sees action at least four times a week.",1
"Little scratched, little grimy along the rivets, but it still cooks like nobody's business!",0
"When I first got married, I made a HUGE mistake.",0
"At the time, the buzz word in kitchen must-haves was Calphalon.",0
"I received a whole set of those pots and pans, and quickly grew to hate them.",0
"The pans pitted from accidental cycles in the dishwasher, and the handles were very hot and awkward.",0
"I bought the cleaner specified for them, but that just became a chore.",0
"I've heard that they've improved some since I purchased mine, but you can't pay me to own those ugly coal colored pots again.",0
Utilitarian doesn't have to equal ugly.,1
"Once I threw out my last Calphalon, I knew that All-Clad had my business.",0
"The company didn't have to wow me with flashy ads, and I didn't have to read any reviews ( gasp ).",1
"As long as the new generation had the same heft and same workmanship as my old one, I was sold.",0
Just as Good as the Relic,0
I have owned my 9 piece set of All-Clad stainless for a year now.,0
"As I had hoped, the shiny stainless exterior has a mirror like finish that comes out of the dishwasher looking glorious, and unlike the Calphalon, hasn't deteriorated ( pitted ) in any way.",1
"I know I haven't had the set for that long, but I don't expect the same troubles that I had with my Calphalon.",1
The composition is quite different.,0
My set included:,0
"10"" Fry Pan",0
2 Quart Sauce Pan with Lid,0
3 Quart Casserole with Lid,0
3 Quart Saute Pan with Lid,0
6 Quart Stock Pot with Lid - I love it.,0
Short and fat.,0
From international-gourmet.net....,0
""" The Collection features a magnetic stainless exterior that is safe for both conventional and induction ranges.",0
The cooking surface is hand-polished 18/10 stainless steel that will not react with food.,1
"The inner core is pure aluminum not just at the bottom, but all the way up the sides.",1
All three layers are bonded together for optimum heat conductivity.,0
"The long, stay-cool handles, non-corrosive rivets, and sure-fitting lids are all of gleaming stainless.""",0
Why I Chose the Stainless,0
Short Story: Dishwasher safe,0
"Long Story: If you've been shopping around, you may already know that All-Clad is available in four collections: Stainless Steel, Cop-R-Chef, LTD aluminum, and Master Chef.",0
"I did court the Copper version, but was worried about the upkeep of the material.",0
Copper needs to be polished and retinned.,0
"Frankly, I'm not ready for that kind of commitment.",1
The LTD just wreaked of Calphalon.,0
It has that anodized coal colored exterior that I just couldn't bear to see again.,1
It isn't dishwasher friendly either.,1
The Master Chef has a brushed aluminum exterior that lacks the glorious shiny appeal of the Stainless.,0
"Lo and behold, you can't dishwasher this variety either.",1
**Stainless it is.**,0

Trust me on that one.,0
Who said teflon doesn't have it's place??,0
"Eat, and be merry.",0
All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans hold a place of high esteem in my cooking endeavors.,0
"The acquisition of the 12"" model to my collection of cookware prompted this review, though other sizes ( 7"", 8"", and 10"" ) endure similar use in my home and are of equal quality.",0
Superb skillets/fry pans...,0
"no doubt, no question and no contest!",1
Dateline: A Mid-Summer's Day,0
Place: Flea Market,0
Time: for coffee,0
"As I strolled the grounds of a local flea market on a cooler-than-usual summer morning, something caught my eye.",0
"A gleam of sorts, almost like a lightning flash, off to one side and at the back of one of the long, church supper tables set up for flea-marketing fanatics ( don't look at me! ).",1
"Ever feel like you should steal quietly up to a store shelf, yard sale box or flea market table for fear someone else will see what you see and beat you to it?",0
"Maybe you've felt that surge of adrenalin as you hurdle your small child ( or someone else's ) in effort to beat the imagined crowd thronging to the object of your desire, then halt suddenly, about four steps from the object and try to act casual?",0
"Me? I don't remember what I did, it all happened so fast.",1
But I do remember no one was injured in the process and I came away with a brand-spankin'-new All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pan ( 12 inch ) for a whopping $ 7.50 ( actual retail price?,1
about $ 125 ).,0
"No quibbling, and I didn't even ask for a bag!",1
Not My First Experience with All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans,1
"I admit I am an All-Clad, fan club member, in my mind...",0
since they don't have a club.,1
"I don't have a card to carry, a poster to hang up in my kitchen, or even a bubblegum card to show for it, but I do have a nice collection of All-Clad Stainless Steel Cookware stowed in my cupboards.",1
I'd display them on a rack if my kitchen would move over and make room for one.,0
"This pan came into my kitchen to support two other All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans as the bottom of the stack, the"" support pan"" of the bunch, and the""big gun"" of the All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pan line.",0
It also supports my efforts in cooking to such a degree that I have tossed my copper-bottomed RevereWare pans into my own yard saleable items box.,0
"Oh, and, like its smaller siblings, the 12"" All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pan does a little sizzling on the stove top and some undercover work in the oven, too!",0
Paying a Premium Price for Premium Performance,0
All-Clad is expensive.,0
"That's no secret, but it is often a drawback to regular people, from the everyday cook to the every-so-often gourmet.",1
"No one wants to put forth this number of greenbacks if they don't have to, but every now and then, someone gets curious and bites the stainless steel.",1
I know I did.,0
Lucked out on a 7-piece set at the price of one pan when a nearby store closed.,0
How's that for a sign?,0
"Now, I look for signs like these:"" SALE"","" Half Off"","" Try-Me Price"" and"" Seconds"".",0
"All-Clad, even as a"" second"" (visual, surface flaws only, such as scratches/nicks ), All-Clad Stainless Steel is no second-skimmings.",1
Let the Cooking Commence!,0
"I have already test-driven the 12"" All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pan, knowing full well what performance I'd get after years of using it's 10"" and 7"" Stainless siblings.",0
Sauting and browning is a snap with the All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans.,0
"In any of the three skillets ( fry pans ) I own, I just heat a few puddles of oil until they smoke, add the food to the pan, turn down the heat to medium-high ( gas range ) and stand back to watch the results, returning now and then to stir, turn or simply admire the results.",0
I much prefer the All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans to my non-stick pans for sauting and browning because the difference in them is amazing.,0
"The stainless works with the moisture in the food better, sealing the outside of the food and steaming away excess moisture with mouth-watering results.",0
Something about the non-stick pans causes the same foods to be a bit more dry.,0
"I attribute this to the ability of the stainless surface to""hold"" the food until it has cooked away enough moisture to""let go"", while with non-stick cookware we'd ask for a refund if the pan""held"" the food.",0
I reserve the non-stick for eggs over-easy or omelettes.,0
"The"" A"" List for the All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans includes:",0
 All-Clad Lifetime Warranty,0
 Long handle for easy maneuvering and better balance,0
" Little chance of burning/scorching (unless you leave the pan on high, unattended, for an unreasonable length of time -- you can't expect miracles, even from miraculous cookware )",0
 Cooking performance like you've never experienced before.,1
"If you're a good cook, All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans make you a great cook, and you'll feel the difference.",0
" Looks aren't everything, but you'll see looks of longing by others toward your All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans as they note the gorgeous, stainless sparkle on your stove top, hanging from hooks, or peeking from your cabinets ( if you have to stow them, as I do ).",0
" Above-average customer service for questions, advice and where to purchase",0
 Durability far beyond what you've enjoyed with cookware before.,0
Your All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pan will receive some battle scars ( generally from less-than coordinated moves on your part ) and minor surface wear ( mostly on the bottom from cast-iron gas stove grates ),0
"That, in slightly-skewed acrostic form, is ALL-CLAD.",0
Add to that list the stay-cool handles and how can you miss?,0
"All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans are oven-safe, though the stay-cool handles will get hot in the oven.",0
"Feel free to brown some chicken on the range, add seasonings and/or sauces and pop it into the oven -- all in the same pan.",0
"The""don't wash a dish by hand unless you have to ( or want to )"" motto I uphold is quite satisfied by the oven-safe aspect of All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans.",1
One pan to wash!,0
"The"" Clad"" in All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans",0
"Aside from the shock of the price tag, an All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pan will do nothing but please you, both in its attributes related to your cooking and in its ease of cleaning.",0
"Every All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pan, no matter the size, offers these things:",1
" an aluminum core for dependable, even heating",0
" stainless steel surrounding the aluminum from top to bottom, side to side and all the way to the end of the handle.",0
"No fillers, no coatings, just SOLID stainless steel",1
" highly polished finish, that with proper care will look pretty much like the day you bought it after every cleaning",0
" no gimmicks, no teasers, no empty promises -- just good, solid, built-to-last cookware",1
Another solid part of your All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pan is the customer service you'll find via e-mail.,0
"No"" canned"" answers, but a real live person with a name to answer your questions!",1
I used the e-mail service about 5 hours after making my first All-Clad purchase...,0
a rainbow appeared on the All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pan after its first use and cleaning.,0
A rainbow...,0
horror of horrors!,0
And I have felt so awed by them before this unexpected encounter.,0
"I thought I may have used something out of the ordinary to clean it ( Dawn dish liquid and a dish cloth ), but learned, through the quick ( within hours ) customer service reply, that the""rainbow effect"" often occurs after the first few uses and then doesn't return.",1
"If it's that unsightly in your beholding eyes, sprinkle on a bit of Bar-Keeper's Friend, a bit of water and polish in small, circular motions...",0
and the bloom is back on the rose!,0
"That has been my worst""problem"" with All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans or any other All-Clad product.",0
"Stainless Sanitation, Simply Stated",0
Dishwasher safe?,0
"Yes, but I don't go that route.",1
"This is a big deal, as I abhor doing dishes by hand.",0
"In the case of cookware, I want to be sure any residue comes off the surface, including grease that sometimes doesn't come off and gets baked on in the dishwasher.",1
"A hand-washing of my All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans won't kill me, and I get better results in the end.",0
Regular liquid detergent and a soft cloth or sponge are all you need to clean the All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans...,0
and water.,0
"As far as harsh scrubbers ( SOS pads, Brillo, other steel-based cleaning items ), the company doesn't recommend using them, and I avoid them anyway.",1
Would you use one of these things to wash your car?,0
"A plastic scrubbing pad works well, and Bar Keeper's Friend really is a friend, and to many other products besides All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans!",0
Don't Settle for Substitutes,1
"If you really are in the market for excellent cookware and are willing to either fork over the cash to pay full price or pay a bit less wait for a great sale ( or a lot less and go the"" seconds"" route ), All-Clad Stainless Steel Fry Pans make a wonderful investment.",0
"Over time, they will pay for themselves in the more-than-palateable results you get from them.",0
I no longer look at any other lines of stainless steel cookware -- a big deal for a bargain shopper such as myself.,1
"After all, I shop at flea markets, don't I?",0
"Read some, rate some, COMMENT LOTS!",0
"I love to cook fancy, gourmet dishes, but my pots and pans were always""fast food"" quality.",0
"For years, I've been limping along with a hodge-podge collection of scratched up non-sticks and some ancient cast iron pans.",0
I bought the 9 piece set a few years ago and it's been one of my better purchases.,0
I didn't want anything that required lots of care and fussing - and these DON'T!!,1
I throw them in the dishwasher and then throw them in a messy pile in my cabinet and the still look new!!,0
I have burned sauces in them and they've cleaned right up with little effort or scouring.,0
I even use ( gasp!! ) those green scratch pads and they still look great!,0
"For really stubborn stuff, an overnight soak is sufficient and then it rinses right out.",0
"I always use a spray-on shortening when I cook and it does sometimes leave a brown residue, but that also cleans up with a tiny bit of effort.",0
The manufacturers at All Clad caution not to use salt in the pan without first adding some kind of liquid - I'm imagining that the chemical reaction of the salt could pit or discolor the pan.,1
I use both metal and plastic tools and they both work fine and don't seem to cause any serious scratching.,1
"These pans not only look professional and stylish, they are also very well-made.",1
They feel comfortable in your hand and the handles don't get very hot.,1
"After 3 yrs. of serious use, the handles seem as solidly attached as the day I bought them.",0
Food cooks evenly and pans are heavily weighted on the bottom so they don't tip or warp.,1
"The dutch oven or stock-type pan is sufficient for my purposes, but could be a tad small for Thanksgiving size proportions.",0
It's perfect for pasta for a family of four.,0
"The skillet is a fairly standard size, but is nice in that it has a little handle opposite the long one, giving you something to hold on to when pouring.",0
"Foods, such as omelets, slide gracefully out of the sautee pan ( the only pan without it's own lid ).",1
The larger saucepan gets a lot of use in my kitchen.,0
"It's big enough to boil 3 or 4 potatoes, or most side dishes for a family of four.",0
The smallest saucepan is tall and narrow and fit perfectly on the smallest burner of your stove.,0
"Because the entire bottom is making contact with the burner, the food or sauces cooked in this pan heat up quickly.",0
I use it for soup or those small pasta mix packages.,0
This smaller saucepan is perfect for hollandaise or white sauce!,0
The photo is deceiving in that there is not a spatula included in this set.,1
I think this set has more lids than most sets of its size.,0
The photos is correct - you get 4 lids in this set!,0
I was worried about the lids at first.,0
"While they seem pretty industrial, they're flat instead of domed and I'm used to those heavy cast iron type.",0
These flat lids actually work much better at sealing in heat than my old cast iron type lids.,0
"Additionally, they are easier to fit in the dishwasher and cabinets because of their flat shape.",0
"While I stated several times that these pans are heavy, I need to point that they are not cumbersome.",1
I have used a lot of cast iron pans ( and swore by them ) in the past and these are not nearly as bulky and hard to wash.,1
"These pans are much, much easier to tip out sauces and such than my cast iron pans.",0
"They cost more than most, but are worth every penny!!",0
No more of those gosh darn non-sticks for me!!,1
"WORD OF WARNING: If your guests see you pull out these professional-looking pans to cook, they're going to expect big things out of you!",0
Its like having 1000 mirrors in your kitchen...good if you are cute...bad if you are Godzilla,0
"So, if you have read my other epinions, you know my loyalty to the best.",0
All-Clad is no exception.,1
"My first set, the MasterChef, was fantastic.",0
"But, I get bored easily.",0
"So, I decided to upgrade.",0
"But, is there really a way to upgrade from All-Clad?",0
I am not sure.,1
"So, I suppose I just took a lateral step and went for the Stainless Set.",0
As for the pro's.,0
"Well, they look great.",0
I mean fantastic - out of the box.,0
They are shiny and heavy.,0
You can feel the quality All-Clad puts into their products.,0
"Yet, this leads to something I am not too fond of.",1
"However good they look new, they are a killer to take care of.",0
"It is recommended that they be handwashed, not for use in dishwashers.",1
"I do good to manually wash my hands, let alone dishes.",0
"So, thats a huge drawback for me.",0
"And, beyond individual use cleaning, they are magnets for fingerprints.",0
"So, if they are left out ( mine are hung from a rack in the ceiling ) they collect dust.",0
It takes time to clean.,0
Bottom line.,0
"But, that being said, I still would recommend them highly.",0
They are a great addition to any kitchen.,0
Why buy junk that you will a ) not be proud to display and b ) throw out after a year or two?,1
Do it right the first time...you will be happy.,0
UPDATE 4/6/03,0
"I would like to note that yes, Williams-Sonoma ( where I purchase this ) did tell me it was dishwasher safe, but to agree, it was suggested that I handwash instead.",0
As for the pieces I own ( not all included in original set ),1
"*Also please note, Williams-Sonoma usually sells specially packaged sets -",0
"*3qt Saute Pan ( cover included ) - This is my favorite, most versatile piece.",0
"I love it because I often cook for large groups, and this can handle a large amount of food and the 4qt is just a monster!",0
"*8"" skillet - A bit small, but ok for me.",0
"I live alone, so sometimes I don't need a huge set.",1
"*10"" skillet - More versatile than the 8"".",0
Its a skillet...need I say more?,0
"*1qt saucepan (uncovered ) - I bought this because it was a"" try-me"" and only $ 20bucks extra.",0
"It was hard to refuse, although, I must say I have never once used it.",1
*2qt saucepan ( covered ) - Another staple.,0
"Good for soups, rice dishes, just about anything.",0
"*8qt stockpot ( covered ) - I would say it is a good, versatile piece, but I would be repeating myself too often.",0
"Thus, you can see All-Clad does a good job pairing things in its set.",0
Other notes -,0
*Warranty - This is another trademark of the brand.,0
"I had to have a few pieces of my MasterChef replaced, and W-S did so with no difficulty.",1
It was very simple to just take in my defective piece and have it swapped out for a new replacement.,0
"My only concern was that I had the original MasterChef, and they discontinued that.",0
"Thus, I could only get the new MasterChef II, which is not an identical match to the original series.",1
That is why I did away with it and went to the Stainless.,0
"I am a bit OCD, and everything must match in my kitchen.",0
*All-Clad boasts that it is made in the USA.,0
This is something I appreciate greatly.,0
"However, I am VERY disappointed in All-Clad.",0
They sell a set of 2 individual oval bakers.,0
"These are much more flimsy than the standard All-Clad, and when turned over, they reveal a sticker claiming"" Made in China.""",0
What a disappointment in Quality/Brand control!,0
*There are many more pieces I plan to get as my needs expand ( and my ceiling space to hang them! ).,0
"I could buy every piece, but then it might take over my apartment.",0
"Also, my set included no non-stick pieces.",1
"Although I prefer the standard coating, I think it might be nice to have a few pieces for certain dishes.",0
I guess it is only befitting that since I wrote a review about a potato masher that I should write about the companion piece that usually goes along with it hand and hand.,0
When purchasing a peeler I always try to look for something with a handle that if large enough to grip and not cut into the palms of your hand when you are using it.,1
I have tried the Ecco but they are so very uncomfortable as the handle is made of a thin wire that does cut in to the palms of your hand and the blade is hard to control.,0
"When I was in Wal-Mart one day I discovered the Oxo 7.25"" Steel Swivel Peeler quite by accident.",0
I had ground my old Ecco peeler in the garbage disposal by accident and needed something to replace it.,0
"I saw the Oxo 7.25"" Steel Swivel Peeler hanging on the display and thought I would give it a try.",0
"The Oxo 7.25"" Steel Swivel Peeler says it is made of steel but there is a major difference between it and the Ecco.",0
"The handle of the Oxo 7.25"" Steel Swivel Peeler is quite large and made out of a rubber so that when your hands are wet it doesn't seem to slide around nearly as much.",1
That makes your peeling time less and your hands feel more comfortable and not nearly as fatigued.,1
If you are looking for something shiney like the Ecco then I suggest that you stick with Ecco as this peeler isn't it.,1
It has brushed steel so that leaves the shine out.,0
The blade itself it made of steel and has not rusted on me like the Ecco.,1
"I like that a lot since I am not having to replace what seems to be like very other month, in fact I have never replaced the Oxo 7.25"" Steel Swivel Peeler since I bought it over a year ago.",1
"When looking at the Oxo 7.25"" Steel Swivel Peeler you will see that the blade has a elongated hole right down the middle of it.",0
On either side of the hole there is a blade that you can use so that makes it nice for people that are left handed and right handed.,0
Also with this blade when scraping vegetables you can go up and down instead of one directions and the blade will catch the skin going both ways.,0
The blade does swivel back and forth for ease of use but doesn't go too far so that you have trouble.,1
"The Oxo 7.25"" Steel Swivel Peeler measures 7 1/4 inches from the top of the blade to the end of the handle.",0
That makes it nice as it isn't too large but large enough to get the job done effectively.,1
"On the end of the blade you will see something that resembles a point, this is what you use to remove the eyes from potatoes or spots from your other vegetables.",0
"Now the Oxo 7.25"" Steel Swivel Peeler isn't just for potatoes, you can use it for cucumbers, carrots, zucchini, apples, peaches and whatever fruit or vegetable that is firm and has a very thin skin.",1
"Another thing I like the Oxo 7.25"" Steel Swivel Peeler is you can make chocolate curles for cakes and cupcakes by running the blade down the side of a piece of baking chocolate that has been chilled.",0
If you are one of these people that prefers to hang thing instead of placing them in the drawer then you are in luck.,0
"The Oxo 7.25"" Steel Swivel Peeler does have a hole in the handle for this purpose.",0
I usually just place mine in the drawer and when the dishwasher is too full I slip the handle over one of the spindles in the dishwasher and let it hang so that way I can get it good and clean.,0
"The clean up is easy, like I said above, just place in the dishwasher and slip into the drawer when done.",0
"The next time you are looking for a peeler give Oxo 7.25"" Steel Swivel Peeler a try it's worth the extra $ 2.00 that you will spend.",0
Thanks for reading.,0
I am a trained chef and I have owned 2 of my own restaurants and I have to tell you I have never cooked on anything that comes even close to the performance of All-Clad cookware.,1
"Don't get me wrong, I have owned lots of other cookware, but they all fell short in one way or another.",1
"There is a so called professional cookware that is made from hard anodized aluminum I think it is spelled Calaphon, DON'T waste your hard earned money on this hard anodized cookware, and then there is a very famous chef from Austria that sells his own cookware on HSN network and he claims he uses it in his restaurants.",1
Mr. Puck might use it in his restaurant but if he does he destroyes a bunch of it.,0
"On the other hand I did use my All-Clad in both of my restaurants and I'm not saying that I am a famous chef but I am saying that anybody that wants to cook like one of the famous chefs, buy a set of All-Clad cookware.",1
The reason I love cooking on it so much is the way it conducts heat.,0
And afterall that is what cooking is all about.,0
The reason All-Clad conducts heat so much better is that they have a stainless steel outside and an aluminum in the middle and another stainless steel skin on the inside of the pans or pots.,0
"Stainless steel is a great metal but it doesn't conduct heat very evenly, on the other hand, aluminum is great at conducting heat evenly but it doesn't hold up very well, but put them together and WOW WEE what a wonderful marrage of two great metals.",1
"And if you ever see an All-Clad pan cut in half, you will see what I mean.",0
"The bottom of all, All-Clad cookware has about 1/4 inch of aluminum sandwitched between two skins of stainless steel.",0
"As far a finish is concerned, I have not seen a better set of cookware in my life.",1
If you want to keep the beautiful finish on your All-Clad cookware dont use steel wool or the green scotchbrite sponges or pads on the outside of your pots and pans.,1
All-Clad does make many types of exterior materials for there cookware or I should say finishes.,0
"The one I use is the bright Stainless steel inside and out, but they have the chefs style which is a dull stainless outside and.They also have the LTD version and that is black on the outside and they also have the Copper but I don't know much about this beautiful cookware except that it is the most expensive and most likely the best at conducting heat and keeping it hot.",0
"I could go on and on about how wonderful this cookware is, but the bottom line is you should try it for yourself.",0
"If you can't afford a whole set, buy one peice and see for yourself.",0
"I did read some other reviews and the reviewers said that the thing they didn't like about All-Clad cookware is that it was hard to clean, NO WAY!!!",1
"it is harder than a non stick surface, but if you really burn something into the pan just put a small amount of Dawn and a little bit of water in the pan or pot and let it soak and in a few minutes it will come clean.",0
The good really out weighs the bad when it comes to All-Clad cookware.,0
"hello,",0
one of my favorite hobbies is cooking.,0
"i have enjoyed this since i was nine years old when i would come home at lunch time and prepare my own meals ( latch-key kid, you know ).",0
i did that through high school and yep this went through college and and then professional school.,0
i bought my first set of all-clad when i was doing my residency.,0
a residents life is miserable and the only joy i had was cooking a nice meal.,0
all-clad fit the bill.,0
its weight and balance is perfect.,0
"and after learning the correct temperature and slightly different techniques to cook the things i loved, i was more than content.",0
this line of cookware allowed me to push the boundaries of what i was used to.,0
caramelization was easier and simmering was more even.,0
i didn't believe it at first that cookware made such a difference but now i do!,1
i don't like the master-chef line.,1
"no performance reason, just for me, the black is unesthetic.",1
better performance from the anodized aluminum exterior?,0
probably.,0
i started with a ten piece set.,0
i now have over forty-five pieces with one or two items being redundant.,0
"i started with mostly stainless steel, then tried a few copper pieces but the constant attention that the copper exterior needed was annoying.",0
i finally stumbled onto williams sonoma's'copper-core'. it has a core of copper and is an absolute dream to cook with.,0
i thought my beginner stainless was excellent but the copper-core is unbelievable.,0
i have almost every piece in that line.,0
temperature eveness is unmatched!,0
"copper-core is expensive but if i had to recommend essential three pieces, they would be as follows: the chef's pan, the 4 quart sauce and the 8 quart stock pot.",0
"i wish they would make the pasta pentola in a beautiful copper core for, as far as i know, it comes only in stainless steel.",0
am i being biased towards all-clad?,0
i don't think so ( their tea kettle is one of the ugliest i have seen ).,1
i have tried the other brands like calphalon which i instantly did not like.,1
"then there is analon, circulon.",0
all of which i have purchased and returned.,0
i picked up the kitchen aid line while window shopping.,0
it seems they tried to copy all-clad in design and function.,0
the handle seemed uncomfortable and was not balanced.,1
"calphalon has a similar handle to all-clad and the balance is pretty good but the line is mostly aluminum and a lot of their lines have glass lids which for me ( who has worked in three different restaurants as chefs while attending university ) is silly as one is bound to'drop' things, especially lids.",0
"if i were to open a restaurant, i would definitely have all-clad as my main cookware.",0
a distant second choice would be calphalon stainless line.,0
take care!,0
"I woke up one morning with one thought... I am 35 years old, a good cook, and it's high time I bought a REAL set of cookware.",0
"A full set, and, yes, if need be, an expensive set!",0
"Luckily, I could further justify my purchase with two facts: one, it was Mother's Day, and I am a mother; two, I ran a home daycare at the time, and could write it off as a business expense!",0
"Feeling uncharacteristically decadent, I set of to the chicly overpriced Williams Sonoma, giddy with the thought of putting all my old, dilapidated cookware out to pasture to make room for the shiny new.",0
"The sales lady was matronly, kind, and almost frighteningly astute about the many different types of cookware they offered.",0
"I had my eye on the copper, which was the most expensive.",0
"She discouraged me at once, agreeing it was the most beautiful, but... the polishing.... I'd be sorry, she said.",0
"Having gained my trust by steering me away from the big sale, I was now ready to take her every word as gospel.",0
""" I like the clear lids on these,"" I said of another set.",0
Wrong again.,0
"She said,"" Clear lids make no sense since, well, putting a lid on cooking food causes steam, and steam is hard to see through.""",1
I'd be sorry.,0
"I looked around hopelessly... the other choices seemed so boring, or worse, gray and ugly.",0
I sighed heavily.,0
""" Guess I'll just go for practicality, then"", I said,""what about these non-stick babies over here?""",0
"Her face grew dark and her brow furrowed with concern as she pointed out that even the best non-stick cookware ( and hers was the best, of course ) just wasn't very sturdy in terms of the cooking surface.",0
"And it required a fleet of gentle, special utensils, and if I had teenagers, they would scrape the surface with the nearest ( un-gentle and un-special ) utensil, and... I'd be sorry.",0
"And then I saw them... the All Clad, beaming at me, nay, beckoning me from the far wall.",0
Stylishly minimalist looking... I liked that.,0
"Aluminum core with stainless steel food surface... that was a good thing, too, since my husband is convinced that cooking on aluminum surfaces causes Alzheimer's.",0
"Afraid to say anything this time, I merely caressed a fry pan hopefully while waiting for my guru's verdict.",0
"And just as I began to wonder if she somehow got an extra bonus for NOT selling cookware to woefully inexperienced, unworthy candidates, she beamed back at the beaming All Clad and said, simply,"" Yes.",1
"Oh Yes, these are... well, they're just wonderful.",0
You will never need to buy another set of cookware.,1
You won't be sorry.,1
"Oh, no, you'll be GLAD for these in your kitchen.""",0
"And to boot, they just happened to be on"" sale""...",0
"a DELUXE""extended""' All Clad Stainless' set for a mere $ 560.00.",0
"This included 2 fry pans ( one very large with a lid ), a stock pot with lid, a sauce pan ( small pot, very handy ) with lid, and a 3 piece double boiler, ( steamer ) my personal favorite.",0
"Since they were throwing in the extra smaller fry pan, that made TEN pieces in all, including lids the way they do.",0
"I personally think counting the lid as a'piece' is sort of a stretch, don't you?... kind of like trying to count one's dog as a dependent at tax time.",0
"Anyway, my set did not include the piece shown in the photo for this category, so i figure since the time I purchased my'Stainless' set, they must have taken out a piece and replaced it with the pasta insert.",1
"Or maybe they just chose any pretty piece of ALL CLAD Stainless for the photo, even if it isn't in the set.",1
Who knows.,0
"Even given the extra pan I'd be getting, the price seemed a bit ludicrous, even in my self-indulgent frame of mind.",0
"I mean, we were talking about pots and pans, for god's sake.",0
My husband's face looked a little greenish and moist.,0
I vaguely recall him stammering something about being able to buy quite competent cookware elsewhere for a lot less.,0
But I didn't trust him.,1
I trusted HER.,0
"And over two years later, I'm not sorry.",1
Here's why:,0
PROS:,0
Downright elegant looking... very streamlined / modern looking,0
"Heavy and solid; well crafted, durable ( no warping )",1
Heats evenly,0
Cleans super easy if you don't stick or burn food,1
All pieces can go into the oven!!!,0
I love this.,0
Stays shiny with a little TLC,0
Long handles that stay COOL!!!,0
LIFETIME Warranty,0
CONS:,0
"It's important to note that the makers of ALL CLAD say that because of this product's aluminum core and excellent conductivity, it is never necessary to use high heat to cook or brown foods.",1
"This is true, but requires a little patience.",0
"Because if you don't remember to refrain from cooking on high, food WILL stick if you're frying, even with oil spray or butter.",1
"But if you're patient and cook on medium, you CAN fry beautifully in these pans.",0
"Food cooking surface will show very mild scratch marks and slight rainbow colored haziness if you use metal cooking utensils regularly, or of you scrub too hard or burn something.",0
This is mortifying!... like getting that first scuff mark on a black suede purse.,0
"It can be helpful to call a friend to help""talk you down"" when the first scratch occurs.",0
"Says""dish washer safe"" in the insert info, and their web site says that's O.K. for their Stainless line, but their recommended cleaning method is with a low-abrasive cleanser called"" Bar Keeper's Friend,"" which also supposedly removes any of that'cloudy rainbow' discoloration that can crop up over time if high heat is used.",0
"I use"" Bon Ami"" cleaner, also a low abrasion brand, and I hand wash my set to try to preserve the high polish shine.",0
"I have to admit, hand washing is a little inconvenient.",0
"But all things that last ( wether it's a great marriage or a great fry pan ) require a little extra care... so all said, she was right...I'm glad I got Clad.",0
I have one piece of All-Clad.,0
"About a year ago, I needed a pretty pot that I could set out on a buffet table.",0
Rather than buy something decorative I decided to buy something functional but great looking and user-friendly.,0
I fell in love with their Paella Pan.,0
It seemed so all-purpose and I had seen the All-Clad label on many exclusive cooking shows.,0
"I'm hardly an expert chef, but you'd hardly know it from the way people raved about my dish and the great looking presentation my All-Clad Paella Pan made.",0
"Everyone knows I'm a big fan of stainless-steel cookware in general, but if you are going to spend the money, you might as well get the best.",0
And the best is All-Clad.,0
"I'm telling you, when I come up with enough money I will most certainly invest in a full set of All-Clad as my alternate/special occasion cookware.",0
Don't even think of throwing money away on Calphalon.,1
"In the department stores, the Calphalon hard anodized pieces just look plain ugly--a mess waiting to happen, with that anodized residue.",0
They look like half-done pieces of pottery that have already been burnt.,0
"Is this a look you want in your kitchen everyday, or for special occasions?",0
Do you want hard-anodizing to come off on your food?,0
It certainly came off on my finger when I ran my hand across the Calphalon in the department store!,0
"I'm saving my pennies, but in the meantime, if fire, flood, or earthquake strikes; the one article from my home that I will make sure to save is my All-Clad paella pan.",0
I had ample opportunity to find out before the wedding that my now-husband is not a friend of nonstick cookware.,1
"Metal utensils, scraping with a fork, burning things, steel wool, you name it.",0
"So when I went looking for cookware for our gift registry, I only considered stainless.",0
"All-Clad had the best selection, the best price, the best handles, you name it.",0
It was also recommended by the major nameless consumer guide ( this was in my pre-Epinions days ).,0
We have a winner.,0
The handles stay cool on the stove and have such a nice feel to them.,0
The pan's shape is just right for sauteeing or omelets.,0
"And they clean up easily enough, even when that man I married burns something on the bottom and then doesn't soak it.",1
"I handwash everything ( we have no dishwasher ), so ease of cleanup was a major consideration.",1
I've been especially pleased with my results with grilled-cheese sandwiches in these pans.,0
They turn out much less greasy than those made on the electric grill.,0
"My only real concerns are that the handles are heavy enough that the pan can overbalance if your burner isn't steady, and ours ( old electric rounds ) sometimes aren't.",1
I have to be very careful about that.,0
And the pans are heavyish.,0
Prolonged shaking for sauteeing takes some arm strength.,0
But I *am* something of a wimp.,0
What a beautiful set!,0
"By far, this is the best cookware set I've ever purchased.",0
"A tough competitor to, and better value than Calphalon's Stainless.",0
"The special characteristics of this Farberware line is the combination of 18/10 stainless with a mirror-like luster, a Cooper base and long, riveted handles.",0
Our new stove has high stovetop grates and was adding too much time to cooking ( pasta water took 1/2 hour to boil ).,0
"We decided on FMCC for the good Farberware reputation, and because it offered copper with an aluminum core ( called"" clad"" ).",0
This manufacturing process is well established as an excellent heat conduit = even heating with no hot spots.,1
Our FMCC set delivers as promised - even cooking and a noticeable shorter cooking time ( pasta water is back to where I was: 12-15 min boil ).,0
Cooking is back to a pleasure.,0
The Copper bottom will require some maintenance if you want to retain the beauty.,0
""" Noxon"" does the trick.",0
I haven't had the set long enough to see how the mirror-like finish will stand up.,1
Stay posted.,0
Matching stainless lids are cast with a recessed rim for good steaming and basting.,0
Lids are included on most pieces so you won't have to scramble to find a retrofit or open stock piece.,1
Farberware went the extra mile and included nice long handles that are elegantly riveted.,0
A simple Fleur de lis pattern at the rivets is a lovely detail.,0
This collection is suitable from oven-to-stovetop so you can go from the cook top to oven and keep food warm last minute.,0
Baking/browning is also possible though I would never bake in them myself.,1
Clean up is good too!,0
Our new home has very hard water making all cleanup a chore I'm not used to.,1
My Calphalon stainless is a nuisance to keep clean within warranty.,0
"Unlike Calph, this Farberware set has the recessed rim in the lid which is far more manageable in the sink.",0
"Or, if everything goes in your dishwasher, pop your FMCC in - it's safe!",0
"The tips included are thorough and very friendly, unlike the competition.",0
There are 2 sets to choose from: 8 or 10 pieces.,0
"- The 8 piece had a 1.5 and 3 QT sauce/steamer combo, 6 QT stock pot all with rim-fitted covers, and a 10"" open saute ( would have loved a lid here too ).",0
"- The 10 piece set adds a 12"" covered skillet w/ helper handle, but substitutes an 8 qt.",0
"covered stockpot w/ steamer insert for the 6 QT stock pot, and a 2 QT sauce for the 1.5 sauce.",0
None of the substitions are available in open stock so I'm short the 2 QT saucepan- my preferred size for everyday.,1
"I chose the 8 piece set ( from Amazon.com with a free XL stainless colander +/SYM free shipping ), and purchased another brand 8 QT stockpot to complete my immediate cookware needs.",0
"I'm chomping at the bit for the Farberware Copper 12"" skillet.",0
That's next!,0
"Farberware comes with a lifetime warranty, and it has always been a""no-questions-asked"" replacement policy!",0
I have killed a few Farberware percolators in my day ( on 15 hrs/day ).,0
"But, when I felt it warranted replacement, my percolator was replaced - quickly.",0
Farberware was sold off to a few years ago to Salton* and I have not had a replacement issue since.,1
I hope their past protocol remains.,0
"*( Salton( R ), George Foreman( TM), Toastmaster( R ), Breadman( R ), Juiceman( R ), Juicelady( R ), White-Westinghouse( R ), Farberware( R ), Melitta( R ), Welbilt( R ), Aircore( R ), Russell Hobbs( R ), Tower( R ), Haden( R ) and Pifco( R ).",0
Open stock is limited.,0
I'm hoping they add saucepans and more to open stock soon.,0
"Overall, I'm thrilled!",0
I received one 1.5 qt pot from the Farberware Millennium Stainless Steel Copper clad line.,0
It was purchased at a discount home outfitter.,0
I used to work in the housewares dept of a large department store so I know what one should look for in cookware.,0
Here is why this is an excellent line and some things that prevent it from being perfect.,0
"The interior is a high polish interior ( read: very shiny, almost mirror-like ).",0
This prevents heat from escaping out through the sides of the pot so a lower heat setting can be used.,0
The handles are riveted on so they are much sturdier than if they had been electro-welded on ( this is how handles on most pots are affixed ).,0
The copper bottom allows for even heat distribution across the bottom of the pot.,0
Copper also heats up very quickly.,0
"The pot is also a decent weight, it's durable but not too heavy to use.",1
There are not many things that seriously need to be improved on this pot.,1
"The lid could be a little more tight-fitting, in my opinion a little bit too much steam ( and heat ) is able to escape.",0
"The handles, which are all metal, have not gotten very hot in my experience but they do become warm so these aren't the best pots for young children to learn how to cook with.",1
"I would have preferred a"" capped"" bottom ( when the conductive metal, either aluminum or copper is sandwiched between the stainless steel pot and a stainless steel"" cap"" ) but that I believe my preference is a personal one, I don't think it would have done anything to improve the pot.",1
Cleaning this pot is super easy but I would warn people to take care not to overfill the pot.,1
"If the food level goes above the rivets for the handles, it can become harder to clean around the rivets.",0
I wrote an earlier opinion on non-stick cookware.,0
I was told by one particular cookware company that non-stick cookware can emit formaldehyde into the air when you cook with it.,0
"I had cooked with an expensive set of non-stick cookware for years, and I found this hard to believe.",0
"So I did some investigating on the interne, and while some information did confirm this, one manufacturer of non-stick cookware addressed this concern by stating that if nonstick cookware is extremely overheated ( as in unattended cookware ) the fumes could be deadly to birds.",0
"They also suggested not keeping your bird near the kitchen, because their respiratory systems are sensitive.",1
"I am a health nut anyway, and like to avoid breathing irritants like aerosol hairspray, fumes from some cleaning products, some scented candles, etc.",0
So I decided to replace my non-stick cookware.,0
The Search Was On,0
"Before I make any large purchases, and I consider a new set of pots and pans an investment and a large purchase, I check out all the brands on the market.",0
"I speak with people and see what they use and like, and I read epinions!",0
I kept hearing how people loved their stainless steel pots and pans.,0
I also got out my handy Consumer Reports Buying Guide ( I love these guys! ) and read what they had to say.,0
"My main choices, if I didn't want non-stick surfaces, were Commercial-style stainless steel, aluminum, copper, cast iron, or tempered glass.",1
I had already owned tempered glass in the past and I didn't like the way everything I cooked seemed to burn on the bottom of the pans.,1
"I also had previous experience with aluminum pans with copper bottoms, and the copper was very difficult to keep shiny and new looking and I am wary about the connection between aluminum and Alzheimers ( I won't even use deodorant with aluminum in it, why would I cook with it? )",1
"And cast iron was out, because the one skillet that I own ( just for making my famous biscuits and gravy ) has some upkeep to it to keep it rust free.",0
That left stainless steel.,0
"So I spoke with a wealthy friend who has the best of everything and asked her what she cooks with... walla!! - she uses and LOVES stainless steel, with copper sandwiched between the layers of steel.",0
Which Brand of Stainless Steel Should I Buy,0
I found this set on sale and couldn't pass it up.,0
"Very similar pans made by Kirkland were available through Costco, but I liked some features of the Cuisinart and felt the brand name was reliable and if I were going to plan on using these pans for the next 30 years I had better find a company that will be around in 30 years ( in case something needed to be replaced, my collection added to, etc ).",0
This set comes with a stock pot ( 7 quarts ) and two smaller pans - ( 2 3/4 and 2 qt.,0
"sizes ) all with lids, and a skillet that uses the lid from one of the pots.",0
I plan on adding to it in the future.,0
"I can get a spaghetti cooker, a chafing dish, and other styles to match my collection.",0
"In case you aren't aware of it, the lids are considered pieces of the cookware... they are included in the set - this does not come with 7 pots.",1
The set is 18/10 stainless steel.,0
The interior has a semi-mirror look to it.,0
The handles are welded onto the pots - they are very sturdy.,0
"They can be used in the oven, under the broiler, in the freezer and are dishwasher safe.",0
They also come with a lifetime warranty.,0
"Product registration is easy, you can do it right online!",0
What I Like About This Set,0
I absolutely love these pots and pans.,0
"It took me a little while to get used to them because I have to cook on a lower heat to avoid burning my food, but they cook wonderful.",0
"The copper helps distribute the heat evenly and quickly across the bottom surface, and I have not burned anything yet!",1
They are absolutely gorgeous to look at!,0
They shine like mirrors!,0
The handles have a nice feel in my hand.,0
"I am proud to have them in my cupboards, and feel good about cooking with a material that I think is safer for my family.",0
"They wash nicely in the dishwasher, but since we have hard water and pots and pans come out with spots on them, I choose to wash them by hand instead, and I don't even mind it!",1
"They also stack very nicely so they tend to take up less room in my cupboards than my old set did, and that means more room for more pots!! Yeah!",0
They have a little curved lip on them that makes pouring liquids a cinch!,0
They are MUCH heavier than the non-stick cookware I was using before!,0
"This took a little getting used to as well, but I don't mind, I know that the pans are very sturdy and well built!",1
I feel like one of the pro's while using this set!,0
What I Don't Like,1
"There's not much I don't like, but I would say that the handles get hotter than the plastic ones I was used to using.",1
But that's okay - I just use a potholder or a towel ( I feel like Julia Child ) and it isn't a problem at all.,1
"They are a little harder to clean, but I use a plastic scrubbie with liquid dish soap and they clean right up.",0
"If I do get something that resists cleaning, I add a little soap and water to the pan and let it sit on the stove top on a very low heat for a few minutes, and this seems to help jump start the cleaning process.",0
I Do Not Regret This Purchase,1
I don't regret one penny that I spent on this set of pans.,1
They are beautiful and should last a lifetime.,0
I was really skeptical about putting non-stick cookware on our wedding resgistry; I worried burnt food would create a permanent layer on the pan and I'd have to call my omelettes scrambled eggs.,0
"After all, isn't that why they invented teflon-coated cookware in the first place?",0
"Even though, my husband convinced me to get the Cuisinart Everyday Stainless 7-Piece Cookware Set.",0
"The 7 pieces are - two saucepanes ( one small, one large ), a skillet, and a saucepot -- then there are three covers, one cover does double duty.",0
"Anyhow, my husband cooks better than I do and he also pointed out that Emeril and a lot of KPBS cooks use the very same stainless pans.",0
"OK, I was sold.",0
"I have fallen in love with my Cuisinart Everyday Stainless 7-Piece Cookware Set! First off, the pots and pans are gorgeous; professional, highly polished steel with lids that are partially glass so you can monitor what's going on inside.",0
The lids are functional too-- they fit tightly over the pots.,0
They're so cool-looking that they're designed for hanging -- like little pieces of kitchen art.,0
The pans also have a copper layer on the bottoms so they heat evenly; the edges of the pans are as hot as the middle.,0
My omelettes never looked so good.,1
"I also like the handles, which are rounded sheets of stainless ( except on giant pot, which are more like little solid pipes ).",0
They're comfortable to hold on to and never get hot.,1
"They're also easy to clean, even the stuff that gets cooked onto the bottom.",0
"Sure, it's not quite as easy as cleaning a teflon pan, but it's a far cry from scrubbing with an industrial strength scrub pad.",1
I usually wash them by hand because I use them so much but you can put them in the dishwasher if you want to.,0
This was a great investment.,0
"The pots and pans are attractive, heat evenly, are easy to clean, and everytime I use them, I pretend like I'm professional chef on TV.",0
"Sometimes, when noone's around, I even explain what I'm doing.",0
"I might not create gourmet food, but with these pans, I feel like I am!",1
I have finally found a set of pans that are worth the money I paid for them.,0
"I thought I needed a new stove, instead a new set of pans was a better deal.",0
I researched all of the different sets available and decided that these pans were the best fit for the money that was available for me.,0
I absolutely love the speed at which these copper core bottom pans heat up.,0
I can now boil water in half the time and at a much lower setting that before.,0
The pans are sturdy and I don't feel like the handle is going to come loose as I carry something to the table.,1
"I also enjoy the fact that the handles are welded to the outside of the pan, this ensures that there are no rough surfaces on the interior for food particles to adhere to.",1
I also enjoy the ability to cook at high temps with out the sides of the pan heating up.,0
The heat source is concentrated at the base of the pan vice the handle and sides.,0
This is safer and more efficient.,0
The only disadvantage I have found so far is the clean up.,0
The instructions say the pans are dishwasher safe but it is not recommended due to possible cosmetic changes in the surface of the pans.,1
My wife used a metal spoon to sir and this left metal scratches in the pan surface.,0
It did not affect the use only the appearance,1
"When me and my husband got married,my new mother in law gave us this set of cookware as a gift to us.",0
She bought herself a set as well as a set for us.,0
"As soon as I pulled the first pot out of the box, I knew I would be happy with this cookware.",0
"You can simply look at it and know it's not a set of pots and pans you can get for 20 dollars at Wal-mart,and I think that made me feel good,knowing that I could start my own home and kitchen with something I wouldn't be replacing in a year or so.",1
"While the stainless steel accounts for a couple of burns I've received from my own stupidity, I also think it's one of my favorite things about this set.It just makes it look so clean and attractive and durable.",0
I got a lot of use out of the largest pot for the first year by boiling bottles in it constantly. I don't know what I would have done without it.,1
The pot is large enough to fit even two days or better worth of bottles.,0
"Since the time my son was weaned I've found other uses for it,such as making a big pot of spaghetti or some home made soup,or boiling fresh vegetables,it's large enough to hold any amount with ease.",0
"The smallest of the pots is great for things like macaroni,noodles,and making tea. I think I use this piece more than any other.",0
"The second largest pot is great for anything, I use it for all my cooking needs,for anything from boiling nipples in the past to gravies and other things.",0
The skillet is however still my very favorite piece.,0
It can't be described as anything other than wonderful and useful.,0
"If this were cheap cookware,it would have already proved itself with me.",0
"I've forgotten about boiling nipples more than once,and even after that,my cookware still looks brand new.",0
"The only other pot or pan I own outside of this set is a cast iron small skillet my mother passed down for things like pancakes and eggs,and these are all I have needed.",0
"I think that if you walked up to me 10 years from now, I would still be using these dishes and if not,another set of the same kind.",0
"I absolutely love the quality and durability and wouldn't trade my pots and pans for any other,they're just what I need.",0
I am a travel agent.,0
The Starwood hotels gave us an excellent rate for our hotel room.,0
This hotel is way to big for comfort.,0
"We could not afford room service, so maybe this is why we feel this way.",1
We could not afford to avail ourselves to the services.,1
I also did not need a business hotel for my vacation.,1
"We drove from the motel 6 in Venice, Fl, 130 miles, to get to use the early Disney Park privledge.",0
"When you stay at a Disney hotel you can enter Epcot around 6am, which is much earlier than the general public.",0
"When I approached the check-in desk, after a 130 mile drive, I could see disorganization, and bad manners written all over the check-in persons face.",0
Supposedly the room was not ready yet??,1
"We went I June, which was supposed to be low season?",0
"Luckily, we were smart enough to leave our luggage parked in the Alamo rental car.",0
"It would have been a long, long haul since we did not opt for valet parking.",1
I was so grateful that I had left the luggage.,0
"We eventually, after eating up much of our early park entrance time, boarded the ferry for Epcot.",0
The ferry was wonderful.,0
I could have road all day around the highly commercialized area.,0
We docked at the Epcot entrance gate.,0
"When we returned to the Dolphin, around 1 pm because Epcot in June is Waaaay toooo hot!!!",0
We got a room assignment.,0
"It was on the 10th floor, waaaay at the end of the hall.",0
"Well I did ask to be away from the ice machines, so becareful what you ask for.",0
"I had to literally hike down the hall, and roll my luggage along the carpet.",0
This was a task.,0
The luggage did not roll without resistance.,1
"Then when we finally got to the end of the narrow, and hot hall, but quiet, I must say.",0
We had to make a sharp right turn where ( 2 ) rooms were.,0
This narrow alcove of a hall was enough to test my claustrophobia.,0
"We entered the room and were not at all impressed, and this is coming from a motel 6 room.",1
"The bed was non-descript, with an ugly bedspread pattern.",0
"The entire room was pastel, and horribly decorated.",0
I am not in to the whimsical look.,1
"Give me sturdy natical, and I am happy.",0
"The television, which matters not to me, but greatly to our teenager, was a joke.",1
"She however, is not too proud to watch any television, because she is an addict.",1
She had to lay on her side to view the tv because straight ahead was our picture window.,0
"The picture window did not have a balcony, so it was better than no view, but definitely not as good as a balcony.",1
Even at the motel 6 we could step right out.,0
The view of Epcot at night was wonderful though.,0
This was complimentary entertainment.,0
The vanity was long and and nice.,0
"We could put our cooler on it, but there was no sink at the vanity.",1
There was a large mirror which did appeal to the vanity of our teenager.,0
"The bathroom did have a very nice vanity, and a large area.",0
The decoration in the bathroom was lovely.,0
Every morning we got nicer tolietries.,0
"I still have some of them, but of course we travel with soap, and got this at the motel 6 as well.",0
"I had $ 10.00 stolen from my jacket pocket, so be wary.",0
The Dolphin has an honor bar of outrageously priced snacks.,0
There is a plastic locking twisty like they put on shoes in cheap stores.,0
We of course did not touch this.,1
Disney hotels should do away with the honor bar.,0
For goodness sake they collect enough money from the world's life savings purse to comp these Reeses bars and never miss a trick.,1
"Or, they should just remove the honor bars from the room and put refrigerators instead.",0
"After every meal time the guest would put their trays out, and we would take the beautiful flowers off the trays and decorate our room with them.",0
The hike to the beautiful swimming pool area was absurd.,0
It is a wonder people will pay for this long walk.,0
It must kill repeat business.,0
We had to walk through a humongous lobby area wearing our swimmers.,0
"I suppose this is a plus if you are in great shape, but I wasn't.",0
"The swimming pools were very nice and clean, but down the road at the Coronado hotel they have a much better swimming pool.",0
"It is more of a social atmosphere than the lap, lane pool that we did enjoy at the Dolphin.",0
We stayed away from the Grotto pool.,0
It was over run with toddlers.,0
The poolside bar served really good and tasty hamburgers even though it was a bit pricey.,0
"It was very convenient and the service was good, or bad depending upon who was serving.",0
It took us forever to get our to go buddle of food.,0
I thought the kitchen had closed and re-opened.,0
That is how long it took.,0
This hotel is poorly laid out.,0
"It took us several days to find the lower level which is where the Krispy Kreme doughnuts, and exercise room is.",0
Upon check-out the hotel manager wanted to hold a deposit on my credit card.,0
I pitched a fit.,0
"I asked him should I hold his towels as a deposit, and return them later?",0
Needless to say the deposit was removed after housekeeping inspected our room.,0
This was not a lovely stay.,1
We much prefer the Starwood Vistana and Oaks Plantation Resorts to the Dolphin.,0
We actually had maid service there.,0
On a recent visit to NYC I was unable to stay at my regular hotel ( Parker Meridien ) because a client was paying and had reserved my room at the Essex House.,1
"At first I was not upset, for I am always willing to try something new, but from the minute I drove up to the door I knew that this was not going to be a good experience...",1
"The doorman opened the cab door, but continued his conversation with what appeared to be limo driver.",0
I now know that the doormen at the Essex House get a payment from the drivers!,0
In this case the doorman was upset because the driver was telling him that he had already paid him.,0
What a start.,0
"Once in the lobby I could see that the hotel had originally been built with some charm, but it's deco past was now looking very artificial.",0
"Perhaps this is because it is a Westin, and therefore must comply with chain standards.",0
"The front desk person was efficient, but totally characterless.",0
I might just as well have used a machine.,0
"My room was tiny, had a double bed, and was overlooking a courtyard, and smelled of cigarette smoke.",0
"When I called down and said that I had requested a king bedded, non-smoking room I was told that this would cost extra!",0
"What about a room with a view at least, again extra $ $.",0
"I stayed in the room, as I was only staying one night.",0
"What really put me off was that it was not clean ( hairs in the tub, dust in the mini-bar, etc. )",1
"Needless to say, I spent as little time as possible in the hotel, and checked-out bright and early the next day",0
"In New York for New Years 2003,",0
"I had chosen to stay at the Essex House because of the millions of dollars in renovation that had been put into the hotel, the location, and the Art Deco decor that I had read about.",0
"However, I became soon disappointed once I entered my standard room on the sixth floor facing Central Park.",0
It appears to me that the renovation money did not go into the standard rooms of the hotel.,1
My room was very small as it was difficult to maneuver within the room's limited space.,0
The room was dull with worn Old English furnishing.,0
There where handles missing off cabinet doors and the room lacked isolation from the outside and neighboring rooms.,0
"Moreover, the top bed sheet was stained with some type of substance?!",0
I was expecting the rooms to be furnished in Art Deco style as I had experienced at the Grand Hotel in Nuremberg Germany.,0
The only Art Deco decor that I had observed in the Hotel was in the entrance hall of the hotel.,0
"As a Japanese owned Westin hotel, I had high expectations.",0
"I had stayed at Westin hotels before, and was never disappointed until now.",1
The standard rooms lack modern amenities.,0
They appear to be outdated of at least 10 to 20 years.,0
"The corridors are decorated with non tasteful wallpaper, and the paint on room doors is often chiped and needs repainting.",0
"At breakfast, I was once again disappointed.",0
"The chair cushions where worn and torn, and the seating arrangement was uncomfortable.",0
It was too crowded.,0
The breakfast was far from good as the bacon was dried up and the coffee was dull.,0
"Overall, I am very disappointed with the hotel, however I had a good time for New Years 2003 in New York city!",0
I have stayed many times over the years at the Essex House.,0
"Unfortunately it has now become"" just another"" hotel.",0
"Westin gives you points for staying, but the charm and character are gone.",0
"Most of the good staff have fleed, and they now charge you extra even for a king bed.",0
Ducasse is an incredible rip off.,0
Pretentious is an understatement.,0
"If you can afford to spend $ 300 for a meal, you should give to charity, this is criminal.",0
"Cafe Botanicca is a pleasant environment, and the food is ok, not what it used to be either.",1
"The best joke is the so called,"" St.",0
"Regis Club"" They have taken the top floors added a few amenities and are now trying to convince the public that this is a real St.",0
Regis.,0
How can you do this a few blocks from the real thing?,0
"My new favorite is the Parker Meridien, far superior, and character.",0
My husband and I booked a last-minute trip to Miami in May( two weeks out from the departure date ).,0
We secured a good rate by booking a vacation package through an airline.,0
"Seeing the Sheraton Virtual Tour of the hotel on their website, we could not have been more excited.",1
"When we arrived, we expected a comfortable room, not luxurious, just basic and comfortable.",1
"Buyer beware: when booking a vacation and you are not given the option to upgrade, expect the worst.",1
"When the Bal Harbour says,'standard room', expect a low-end Super 8.",0
The room had not been remodeled in years ( 15 plus ) and severely showed its decay.,1
"In addition, we were given a smoking room when we requested a non-smoking.",0
"Since there was a wedding and a convention at the hotel, we were told that they could not move us to another room.",1
"Although the pool area was aesthetically beautiful, don't be deceived by their advertising: the waterfall within the pool is part of the kiddie pool and there were so many young children that the entire pool area felt like Water Country USA.",0
All that was missing was the wave pool.,0
"We ordered a Pina colada and a Margarita at the poolside bar, both drinks were served in 12 oz plastic cups, and our bill came to $ 25! Needless to say, we learned our lesson and headed down to South Beach the following days.",0
"We did not book a hotel on South Beach because of the countless"" Best Of"" shows on the Travel Channel.",1
"South Beach always scores in the top 10 beaches in the world and is deemed""best party/best nightlife beach"".",0
We did not want drunken college kids walking next to our window all day and night.,1
WERE WE MISTAKEN!,0
"We kicked ourselves the entire stay for not staying down there because the beach was 100X more beautiful than the hotel's, there were hundreds of restaurants, and the area had some of the most stunning architecture we had even seen.",1
"If you do travel to South Beach from the hotel and you want to avoid the $ 20-$ 25 cab fare each way, take the local bus.",0
There are three lines that stop in front of the hotel and the fare is only $ 1 each way.,0
We were astonished when we saw that the Sheraton Bal Harbour made it into the 2003 Resorts and Great Hotels book.,0
We loved Miami and count the months until we go back ( to South Beach ).,0
Enjoy your trip wherever you choose to stay!,0
"Located on the Northern end of the Las Vegas Strip, The Riviera is instantly recognizable by it's huge glittering billboard tower.",0
It advertises itself as having some of the loosest slots in Vegas.,0
"Uh, yeah, and I have some nice lakefront property in Pahrump I'd like to sell you!",0
"Surrounded by tacky joints such as Westward Ho and Circus Circus, it's possible, in the dark, to see the Riviera in her finest lights.",0
"Walk inside and to your immediate left is the a pitch man with microphone, extolling the riches to be had at the $ 40 for 20 booth.",0
"Okay, we tried that, and I have a very strange plastic tote bag, cheapo sun visor and tee shirt, all free advertising for the hotel casino.",0
"We stayed in the San Remo ( Pool ) Tower, one of the two older towers, facing a decent-sized pool.",0
A narrow room with fading carpet and two double beds seemed over-priced at $ 89 a night.,0
"It was, when you consider how much it reminded me of a Motel 6, that might charge half as much!",0
"The little containers of generic lotion, shampoo and soap went right into my travel bag, the need to salvage something from the convention package gone wrong.",0
A 2 for 1 coupon for the World's Fare Buffet was the sole reason for trying this.,0
Remember your school cafeteria?,0
"If you liked said cafeteria, you will enjoy this one, replete with steamed and overcooked fried fish, meatloaf, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, canned-tasting veggies and all the brown-edged iceberg lettuce you care to sink your teeth into.",0
Plenty of jello and stale tasting cake in case you're still hungry.,0
Quantity versus quality does not a deal make!,1
Katy's Coffee Shop was surprisingly good.,0
"That's after waiting in a luncheon line, ( we had 1 hour to eat during the Nursing convention ).",0
"Once the brassy hostess heard we wanted the non-smoking section, you would think we had insulted her personally.",0
"Patting her lacquered bouffant into place she indicated that she was not going to open a new section just for us, and we would have to step aside and wait.",1
"After another 15 to 20 minutes of watching our newly arrived friends streaming in, we were seated.",0
"The Chinese food is very tasty and fresh, and the late night breakfast and Chinese specials were a deal at $ 2.99.",0
"( Yes, I did leave a tip, as the waitress was blameless, but I got in the habit of carrying around comment cards to complete! )",0
"The casino itself is very smokey, and seems to pride itself on hidden bathrooms.",0
"( Hint: there's one to the right of the hotel registration desk, and down a short hallway. )",0
"Low rollers will love Nickel Town, I know I did, with the $.99 margaritas and the chicken finger/hot dog/hamburger specials.",0
"A lot of room is devoted to slots of all sorts, and trust me, this casino isn't giving anything away, folks.",1
"The production show, Splash, combines motorcycles, reed thin show girls, an annoying comedian, and some Ester Williams synchronized swimming.",0
"It's dated, so I would only try it with one of the 2 for 1 coupons from the freebie mags, such as What's On.",0
"Most guys will gravitate to the cheesy girlie show, Crazy Girls.",0
"As I was waiting for another show, I studied the long lines of glazed-eyed zombies exiting the show.",0
Did I mention I was there for a Psychiatric Nursing convention?,0
"Besides Nickel Town, the only reason I might visit the Riviera, would be the excellent female impersonation show, An Evening At La Cage.",0
"I still have fond memories of Frank Marino, ( no, not that Frank Marino, he's in Canada ), as Joan Rivers.",1
"This is one super talented guy, and there are some great numbers with Judy, Cher, Madonna and the rest of the girls, really putting their hearts into it.",0
"If you have kids, try Circus Circus, right across the street, and with room deals that make sense for this part of the Strip.",0
"Sandwiches and beer deals at Westward Ho can be recommended, and you will probably find a nice center strip hotel, ( try Treasure Island ), for the same price you'd wind up paying here.",0
Review Topic: Accommodations,0
I have a very bad experience with Riviera Hotel this spring when I visited Las Vegas.,0
I purchased an US Airways vacation ( including air and hotel ) from their website.,0
"As far as I remember, vacations with accommodations in Rio, Golden Nugget, Excalibur or Las Vegas Hilton were available for cheaper rates than what I paid for Riviera.",0
"Since we took a red eye flight, we arrived at hotel around 12:30 am in the morning.",0
"According to the confirmation from USAirways vacation, we have reservation at Riviera for 3 nights starting that night.",0
"But since hotel check in time was 3:00 pm, front desk clerk refused to let us check in.",0
"Even when I explained to her that according to confirmation which had 3 night reservation, if she does not allow me to stay that night, I will have only two night stay at the hotel.",1
So all she has to do was to move my 3 day stay one day ahead.,0
It was not even problem of availability.,1
"She was ready to accommodate us if I pay them extra for that night, which we did.",0
The whole decor of the casino and hotel seems to have frozen 10-15 years back in time.,0
The rooms are OK.,0
The parking lot for the hotel guests is the farthest I have ever seen.,0
The casino is fairly large.,0
They have some very nice shows if you are interested.,0
"The hotel may be considered on the strip 5 years back, not anymore.",1
"The"" REAL STRIP"" is where the new casinos like Paris, New York New York, Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage etc. are, which is quite far.",0
The last time I visited the Riviera was probably several years ago.,0
"We were drawn by it's magnificent sparkly decor, which is a little deceiving because you don't get what you expect when you walk in.",1
I didn't particularly like the atmosphere or anything about it.,1
walking thru the casino was a little reminiscent of walking thru a library.,0
The casino was extremely quiet.,0
For a moment I almost felt like I should be whispering.,0
Hopefully it's changed since my last visit.,0
"As far as playing the slots, I didn't even bother.",1
My decision to play in a casino is usually based on whether or not there's any noise.,1
I didn't even hear a coin drop.,1
For me that's not a good sign.,1
"The sound of coins, music, even people screaming ( for winning of course ) is the draw.",0
Vegas is about excitement and the Riviera was lacking in that department.,0
"If you are a first time visitor to Vegas, DO NOT STAY AT THE RIVIERA.",1
"As a first timer, I was extremely excited to see all that it had to offer.",0
I booked a room at the Riviera through a travel agency without doing much research.,1
All I knew it was that it was cheap and on the north end of the strip.,0
I arrived and was disappointed.,0
"Not because it was a crummy hotel/casino, its a good clean place with an adequate gambling selection, it just didn't have that overwhelming aspect that the other casinos had.",1
"Its small and very unimpressive compared to the others and its quite a walk to the other casinos,( except for the Sahara and Stratosphere ).",0
"So if you are wanting to get the full experience the first time, pay a bit more and stay at Treasure Island or something in the midst of everything.",0
"The Riviera I think is best for those who have been to Vegas before, want to gamble and have access to the strip, but don't want to pay for all the sights they have seen before.",0
"As a side note, don't waste your money on Crazy Girls, one of their 3 shows, the show is as unimpressive as the hotel and the"" I wanna be'Grace under Fire"" comedian is awful.",1
Just awful.,0
"Although I have not had the""pleasure"" of staying at the Riviera, I have visited the hotel on more than one occasion, mainly on my freebie hunts.( Some",1
casinos give away various promotional items. ),0
"I am aware that the Riviera is often high on the list of travel package bargains, but it is not a place I would recommend to anyone.",1
"For starters, the facade has a large bronze wall sculpture of the thong-wearing showgirls from one of their productions ( Splash?",0
Crazy Girls? ).,0
Basically it is a wall of butts.,0
Classy.,0
"Moving on, the inside is very""old"" Vegas - tacky old carpeting, bright neon lights, and at one entrance, a carnival con man-type talking into a mike trying to get people to pony up $ 20 for $ 40 or $ 50 worth of slot play, which you are almost guaranteed to lose and then you can pick out a lovely""prize"" from one of their counters.",0
Cheesy.,0
"The Riviera is located on a part of the Strip that is removed from the more populated, safe, and""happening"" areas, which are mid-Strip and South Strip.",0
"The Riviera is located on North Strip and is near the Stratosphere, Circus Circus, Slots-a-Fun, and Silver City.",0
They are all old generation hotels and are a painful walk from the newer properties on the Strip.,0
"That part of the Strip is also palpably more seedy - on one occasion I witnessed a man standing next to a garbage can, removing a rubber arm tie from his arm, presumably after shooting up, judging by his appearance.",0
Things like this really take away from a vacation.,0
"So for me, the Riviera is not even on my list of""maybe"" hotels when I go to Vegas.",1
It is with considerable trepidation that I commence on a review of the Benson Hotel that refutes tombarnes' excellent review of this same property.,0
"Still, one of the hallmarks of a really good hotel is consistency of service, and while I'm willing to concede that my review is based on a sample size of only one, I think my conclusions are nevertheless valid.",0
And my conclusion is this: you won't find me staying at The Benson again.,0
"As a native Portlander, I have of course always been aware of this place, with its distinctive architecture, prime location, and ridiculously liveried doormen.",0
Most locals would not hesitate to name The Benson Hotel as the luxury lodging in town.,1
"It's a favorite for wedding nights, prom nights, anniversaries, and probably for sleazy but high-dollar office liaisons too.",0
"For my money, however, regardless of your intent, you can do better than The Benson.",0
The hotel:,0
"Built in 1912 by local timber baron Simon Benson, the hotel lobby displays all the style and excess of the boom era in which it was built.",0
"The lobby features beautiful wood paneling, ornate finish work, and a chummy bar area.",0
"Chandeliers, marble floors, and a grand piano add to the elegance of the space.",0
"Unfortunately ( and this is by no means a phenomenon limited to The Benson ), the lobby also features hoardes of slack-jawed gawkers, at least half of whom are wearing bermuda shorts and talking too loudly.",1
"The room isn't especially large, and the hubbub of traffic makes it a less dignified and special place than the decor would suggest.",0
There's a weird preponderance of ashtrays throughout the hotel.,0
"I think this is a vestigial reminder of the hotels boom days, when smoking was a far more prevalent practice.",0
"Every table in the lobby holds an ashtray, despite no olfactory evidence that anyone has actually smoked in that room since Simon Benson and his buddies sparked up their Havanas at the hotels gala opening.",1
Checking in:,0
"We weren't even planning to stay at The Benson - but a last-minute bid on Priceline landed us a room for around $ 90 - about half the lowest promotional rate available on the hotel website, so we decided to investigate the place.",0
"Best I can tell, the rack rate for rooms at The Benson range from around $ 200 to well over $ 500 per night.",0
"When we checked in, the desk clerk offered us our choice of a smoking room with a king-sized bed or a non-smoking room with two double beds.",0
"I realize that Priceline makes no guarantees regarding the room, but my usual experience is that the hotel will do its best to accommodate visitor preferences.",1
Not so at The Benson.,1
"Our choices were offered in such a desultory, offhand,""take it or leave it"" fashion that I got peeved and loudly suggested that we indeed leave it and find lodging elsewhere.",0
The cooler-headed PrfStars prevailed upon me to take the room with two double beds.,0
Our room:,0
"Upon entering the elevator, we experienced a momentary burst of enthusiasm when we realized that our 12th floor room was at the top of the hotel, with only the astronomically-priced penthouse suites above us.",0
"Upon entering our room, however, all thoughts of luxury and/or panoramic views fled.",0
"Our room was, uh, cozy, particularly given the large footprint of two double beds.",0
"However, any consideration of the room and its amenities was completely overshadowed by the view, which was spectacularly bad - indeed, I don't know that I've ever experienced a worse one.",1
"If you want to experience our view, step outside, stand in a parking lot, bend 90 degrees at the waist and focus intently on the view at your feet - that's what we saw ( minus your feet, of course ).",0
Our windows looked about 30 feet directly across an interior airwell to an absolutely featureless concrete wall.,0
"The scary part, of course, is that we were near the very top of the building, and benefited from at least a little light from the sky - I really pity the poor folks who pay rack rate for a gloomy fourth floor view of the same thing.",0
"For an old building, the room was in adequate, if not pristine, condition.",1
"Lighting was sketchy at best... at some point in the evening I tried to find something in the closet, and it was only by dumb luck that my flailing arms hit a dangling string that was attached to a bulb in the closet.",0
"Additionally, the desk lamp ( which provided the only light other than the wall switch-controlled bedside lamp ) was inoperable.",0
"The walls and fixtures were in decent shape, with trademark beige, white, and black window coverings and shower curtain ( which I found eerily reminiscent of Yasser Arafat's headcovering ), mottled beige walls, a couple of boring pictures, and so-so linens.",0
"Amenities included a ludicrously-priced honor bar, two nice terrycloth robes, and a two-line phone.",0
Resident bathroom expert PrfStars reports that that room suffered from the lack of a fan and that the toiletries were only marginal.,0
"Instead of separate shampoo and conditioner, The Benson offers a"" conditioning shampoo"", which is evidently a bad thing.",0
I did nt know that.,0
"Anyway, in addition, a small shelf in the bathroom held a shower cap ( does anyone actually use those anymore? ), sewing kit, rosemary-scented body wash ("" Who wants to smell like focaccia?""",0
"PrfStars ), and of course the obligatory lint-free all-purpose cloth thing.",0
"Oh, and a glass jar of cotton balls and swabs, which sort of skeeved me, like other people had been fumbling around in the same jar.",0
The Benson offers nightly turn-down service.,0
"When we returned from dinner, our room had been straightened up, sheets turned down, and a couple of chocolates placed on the nightstand.",0
Hideous lite rock music was softly playing from the bedside clock radio.,0
"Nevertheless, it was a nice touch, I guess.",0
"A final, comprehensive gripe:",0
The most significant impression I got from our stay at The Benson was of rampant and utterly unwarranted price gouging.,0
I have no problem with a hotel charging premium prices for unique and/or high quality products.,1
"Indeed, it s sometimes fun to splurge on such luxuries.",0
"But when Im asked to pay three or four times the market price for ubiquitous, easily obtainable things, I just feel exploited.",0
"The rooms are substantially overpriced, at least at the rates that most guests will pay.",0
"Ancillary services, such as parking, honor bar, laundry, and business services are equally inflated.",0
But nowhere is overpricing more evident than in the hotel's dining options.,0
"The Benson has two associated restaurants: the London Grill, located in the gloomy depths of the hotels basement, and the Gaucho Steakhouse, located at street level adjacent to the lobby.",0
"Both offer decent, if stuffy, food and service at prices that make places like The Palm or Mortons seem like a Vegas buffet.",0
We happily passed on both.,0
"Similarly, the room service menu was so inflated as to be utterly laughable.",0
"The cheapest meal on the menu, a continental breakfast consisting of bread, fruit, yogurt, juice, and coffee, was $ 16.00, plus an obligatory 15 % gratuity, plus a $ 2.00 delivery charge.",0
Thats $ 20.40 for a breakfast that has an intrinsic value of about five bucks.,0
Include me out.,0
Conclusion:,0
"So maybe I'm being a little harsh - after all, we were low-rent Priceline customers, right?",0
Wrong.,0
"Well, I mean, we were low-rent Priceline customers, but I don't think that should ever be a reason for less than standard service - therefore, I have to conclude that even had we paid full rate, we would likely have received the same service, the same room.",1
"The combination of ho-hum service, marginal rooms, and sky-high prices was simply unacceptable.",0
"With an abundance of nearby lodging and dining alternatives, I dont see any compelling reason to ever visit The Benson Hotel again.",1
"An excerpt from the hotel website gives some insight into the weird combination of hauteur and sloppiness that, to me, typify the hotel:",0
""" The Benson Hotel in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon, provides travelers a truly unique experience among even the most distinct Portland hotels.""",0
"While I can intuitively grasp what this tortured sentence is attempting to say, I really wish someone would shoot it in the head and put it out of my misery.",0
My experience at the W New York disappointed on almost every level.,0
"Checking in, there was absolutely no recognition of my platinum status.",1
"When I asked about a suite upgrade, I was told that I had been upgraded to a business room but that no suites were available.",1
"I thanked the cast member, walked upstairs and called SPG.",0
"They confirmed that suites were available and at my request, they called the hotel manager.",0
"When I returned to the desk, lo and behold, I had been upgraded to a suite.",0
I just wish it hadn't taken so much effort - it really did colour my entire view of the hotel.,1
We took the lift upstairs and went to see our new suite.,0
"The rooms were small, like most New York hotels.",0
"The hallways are very dark, even by W standards.",0
"The room was very dark as well, and could really do with additional lighting.",0
"Put it on a dimmer if you want to provide ambience, but four 40 watt bulbs are not enough for a two bedroom suite.",1
Even my young eyes complained.,0
But the dim lighting wasn't enough to hide furniture which should have been replaced eighteen months ago.,0
The entire room looked very tired.,0
"Drawers didn't fit properly, everything was rickety.",0
It looked like two-year-old Ikea furniture that had been poorly assembled to start with.,0
"Not at all like the solid, nice looking furniture I've come across at other W's.",1
The'down-at-the-heels' trend continued throughout the hotel.,0
Our coat hooks were loose.,0
Our blinds were frayed.,0
Our air conditioning was an antique.,0
"Still, at least it worked.",0
"I understand that on Monday and Tuesday, the hotel was without air conditioning at all.",1
"In common with every other W I have stayed in, the smoking room I had requested came without any ashtrays.",1
"Ironically, every non-smoking room I have stayed in had two ashtrays in the desk drawer.",0
"If I've specifically asked for a smoking room, please provide me an ashtray.",0
I just might want to smoke.,0
"I did have a few pleasant surprises at the W. Walking past Oasis, the lobby bar, I saw an old friend from the W New Orleans tending bar.",0
We talked for several hours as I helped increase her business.,0
I thought it would be rude not to have a beer or three.,1
"In my opinion, this hotel has had its day.",0
It need a full refit of furnishing and some serious training to the staff before I'd ever return.,0
The W New York is on Lexington right across from the Waldorf ( which is on Park Ave. ) in Midtown Manhattan.,0
"Whether in NY on business or pleasure, the hotel's location is great.",0
"Following Westin's strategy for the W chain, this W was formerly a run down hotel that Westin acquired, restyled and reopened as a W. The rooms are just as small as before but are now nicely appointed.",0
The lobby of the hotel is also very nice - very modern and cool with new-age music playing rather loudly.,0
The hallways on the room floors are only dimly lit and are well appointed.,0
Being a corporate lawyer I travel to NY a lot and have stayed at the W twice.,0
"The first time I was in a small room, but it was nicely decorated and sufficient.",0
The second time I could not believe the size of my room - my dorm room in college was larger.,1
There was no dresser or credenza to store my clothes - only the closet ( which was also very small ).,1
I will not stay at this hotel again just based on the size of this room.,1
I can stay at the Waldorf for $ 10 more ( corporate rate ) and get a much larger room.,0
"Although the room size is awful, the hotel does have some nice touches - the shower head ( no bathtub ) is that very large one that provides a rainfall effect, the room had internet capability, fax machine and the beds are the very nice Westin feather beds.",1
Another benefit of the hotel is that Whiskey Blue is off the lobby.,0
This bar is very popular on the weekends and the lines can get long.,0
Guests at the hotel get immediate access to the bar without waiting in the line.,1
Note that there is no restaurant at the hotel.,1
"If you're considering staying on-site at Disney World, choose a moderate.",0
The All-Star resorts are roughly equivalent to any of a myriad of off-site motels at a Disney price.,0
( Re: HIGH),0
Large groups of junior high and high school kids tend to stay here making the resort noisy.,0
In our first ( and only ) stay here there were two incidents involving kids from these groups.,0
"In the first, a group of kids riding the bus back to the resort literally were terrorizing the passengers on the bus.",0
"When the bus pulled into the stop, they forced open the back doors of the bus and took off before security could arrive.",0
"We were not on that bus, but on a bus that had pulled in behind it, and had the opportunity to talk to the people who were coming off of the bus involved.",1
One woman had two kids in tears and she was on the verge of crying herself.,0
The other incident was also on a bus returning as we were subjected to a group of Pee-Wee football players using very colorful language with no regard to the kids around them.,1
"Their chaperones could've cared less and were only interested in getting back to the resort so they could""kick back with a few beers and watch Monday Night Football"".",0
"Now, while I don't think Disney is responsible for the behavior of these groups, they have also done nothing to curtail their behavior.",1
Year after year these groups continue to book rooms with no consequence for previous behavior.,1
We were not the only ones to have these problems.,1
"I know of people who Disney moved to Deluxe and Moderate Resorts after enduring sleepless nights on account of noisy, rowdy behavior.",0
The rooms at the All-Stars are small.,0
"Although it states that it can accomodate four adults, I think four adults would find these quarters to be very cramped.",0
"The rooms have two double beds, one bathroom, a television armoire and a small table with two chairs.",0
"Instead of the bottles of"" Mickey"" shampoo and"" Mickey"" soaps in the bathroom, there is a dispenser in the shower.",0
Disney cannot guarantee connecting ( or adjoining ) rooms when making a reservation.,1
"Therefore, families or groups traveling together who think the solution is to just book two rooms and open up a door between the rooms can't be guaranteed that will work.",1
The only case Disney will guarantee this is if you are one adult traveling with four kids - the kids would end up in a room by themselves.,0
The food courts at the All-Stars have a wide variety of foods available to purchase.,0
They are also crowded and are noisy.,0
There is no sit-down restaurant as an alternative.,1
The food quality is just what I would call adequate.,0
I'd much rather go off-site to one of the buffets on 192 such as Ponderosa or Golden Corral.,0
I'd spend less money for at least as good quality.,0
"I would also not be subjected to cheerleaders who use the food court as their personal grooming space, spraying hairspray into my food.",1
The pools are more in line with a typical motel rather than the themed pools we've come to expect at Disney Resorts.,0
Other Disney Resorts have nice slides or zero-entry depth pools.,0
"Many of the Resorts even have one or more""quiet"" pool areas where you can get away from all of the kids at the main pool.",0
This is not the case at the All-Stars.,1
Everyone uses the same pools.,0
The closes we found to a quiet pool was just as active as the main pool.,0
"In reality, the two are just a short distance apart.",0
Towels are not provided at the pool and you have to bring your own from your room.,1
The only plus of the All-Stars over off-site is proximity and possibly saving rental car fees due to Disney bus service.,0
"On our visit, we found the bus service at this resort to be lacking compared to others.",0
I would never stay at the All-Stars again.,1
"Given the choice, I would rather stay at an off-site resort or at one of the hotels in Downtown Disney.",0
"We have been taking family trips to Disney World since the time this collection of resorts and theme parks was almost Small Town, certainly compared with the mature ( over-developed? )",0
Disney World of today.,0
"There were just three hotels then -- the Contemporary, the Polynesian and the Golf Resort ( since rechristened the Disney Inn and then Shades o'Green ) -- and one attraction, the Magic Kingdom.",0
"In the intervening years, we stayed at many of the hotels, and at the campground too, and always found the resorts several cuts above those we experienced everywhere else.",0
"Landscaping, imaginative swimming areas, exceptionally attractive rooms and common areas -- the Disney Resorts had it all.",0
And this was true in every price range.,0
"Like most visitors, we found a moderately-priced hotel like Dixie Landings every bit as appealing, and sometimes more appealing, than a super-luxury hotel like the Grand Floridian.",0
"So, we were shocked -- There really is no other word -- when we went to check out the All Star Sports Resort.",1
Yo! Giant Coke sculpture; what was that about?,0
"I suppose the several-story-high sports equipment sculptures could be considered fun, but a Coke cup?",0
"Beyond this in-your-face commercialism, the All Star Sports Resort is just tacky looking, sort of a Motel 6 on steroids.",0
Even the doors look cheesy.,0
"Part of a complex of similar, themed, low-budget motels the All Stars scream low-budget in a way that lower-priced area motels, including Days Inn and La Quinta, too popular off-site competitors, do not.",1
The All Star resorts look like what they are: Disney's attempt to keep every Orlando dollar onsite.,0
"The company does not want to cede any business to competitors on International Drive, a strip just filled with economical motels, and so it offers this under-$ 100 motel to budget-conscious travelers.",1
"In fairness, I have read comments on various Disney Internet message boards indicating that many visitors do enjoy their stays here after they get over the initial shock of seeing the place, and most do report that, yes, the giant sculptures are a bit disconcerting.",0
"There is a very large pool, but again, it looks low-budget.",0
"Unlike other Disney resort pools, this one is not surrounded by landscaping, and it does not offer shade.",1
There is a cafeteria-style eating area.,0
"On our first visit, we noticed that little packets of peanut butter and jelly were out on the condiment counter along with Saltines.",0
"We thought that was a nice touch and a great thing for families with small children, but on subsequent visits did not see the peanut butter.",1
"This cafeteria is not exceptional in any way, but is pleasant enough.",1
The best thing about the All Star Sports Resort is the game room.,0
"It is big and filled with great sports games, both video and arcade.",0
This motel complex is not very near any Disney attractions.,1
"Transportation is by bus, and, because there are lots of people staying here, there is some competition for seats.",0
"In the debate over whether to stay on-site or off-site while visiting Disney World and other Orlando-area attractions, I think if the choice were this motel or an off-site motel, I would go off-site where there are many more attractive lodgings for less money.",0
I think anyone choosing to stay at the All Star Sports Resort would do well to rent a car.,0
This place is pretty isolated from the most desirable sections of the Disney World complex.,0
"If you are vacationing to Disney and would like to stay at a bargain hotel right on property, then you've come to the right place!",0
Disney's All Star Sports hotel offers a great price range and houses you close to the Disney magic.,0
"The rooms are a decent size and each building is themed to different sporting events like tennis, surfing, baseball, and football.",0
The scenery around the area is very nice as well.,0
I recently took a trip to Disney and stayed at this resort for 8 nights.,0
The rooms were a decent size.,0
"For each different themed building, there were different accessories to decorate each room.",0
"For example, there were paintings of surfers and beaches in the surfing building.",0
"Each room has 2 queen sized bed, but I believe you can also stay in a room with a single, king sized bed.",0
"Next to the sink area, there is a closet, a safe, and a bathroom.",0
"The bathroom itself is quite small, but the shower is a standard size with adjustable water pressure.",0
"While the room wasn't so bad, there were things that I liked and didn't like about The All Star Sports, like many hotels.",1
"Stars 1, 2, and 3",0
There are many good things about this resort that helped me to choose it for my stay.,0
First: the excellent price I got for nightly stays.,0
The All-Star Resort offers the cheapest hotel rate in all of Disney property!,0
"Prices can range from $ 89 dollars a night to $ 135, which is really good for staying on property.",0
Second: The transportation provided by Disney at the All Star is the most efficient method of transportation in all of Disneyworld.,0
"Although this may be the cheapest hotel, they sure helped us out on getting from place to place!",0
"On average, I waited about 10 minutes for each bus to arrive to the different parks.",0
"Even better, there is only one stop for many of the busses.",0
"At other hotels, you have to go from place to place to place before you can actually make your way to the park.",0
Third: The food court provided by the All Star is great!,0
"There are many different varieties of food found here, like an Italian place ( pizza, spaghetti/meatballs ), a fastfood stand ( hamburgers, chicken fingers ),""home-cooked"" meals ( meatloaf ) and an all-day breakfast stand so you can get donuts in the afternoon if you really wanted to.",0
Disney also sells a mug for about $ 10.00 that you can use at the soda machines during your entire stay.,0
"10 bucks may seem like a lot right now, but it saves you a lot of money because you can get drinks at your leisure.",0
The Not So All Star...,1
This resort doesn't deserve 5 stars for a couple different reasons...,1
"Too many highschool/college kids Being the cheapest hotel on property, this is the ideal location for high school groups or spring break college students to stay.",0
"Many times the gigantic pool is overly crowded and if you're lucky, you won't be able to hear all of the noise that they make at night.",1
"Room Service isn't so Efficient Again, being cheaper than all of the other hotels, the maids seem not to care when they come to clean your room.",1
"I've gone out early in the morning and come back to the room at about 2:00pm and the room still hasn't been made up! ( Of course, when they finally do clean the rooms, everything is up to par ).",1
Travelling to the attractions takes a little longer than expected...,0
"When you stay on property, you expect to be close to all of the Disney theme parks and attractions.",0
"However, the only places that you are really close to are Animal Kingdom, the Wide World of Sports, and Blizzard Beach.",0
"Everything else is at least a 15 minute ride, if not more.",1
"So, Disney gives you a resort at a great value, but there is still a price to pay for what you aren't literally paying for!",1
This was our 3rd Disney Resort experience.,0
"It's irrelevant but the year before we stayed at the Disney Inn, which is now the military resort, It was a snooze, nice and quiet but completely older adult resort.",0
So going from that to this which was the complete opposite was a big shock!,0
First off personally I was wanting to stay in the music resort but the siblings sports obsession won.,0
Not that it ended up mattering.,1
In a nutshell we all hated the resort.,0
One thing was the fact that you had to walk through a big food court /entertainment center and then we had to hike what felt like a half a mile to our rooms or back to get to the buses that take you to the parks.,0
"Which is another thing, the resort seems to be farther from the parks so the bus ride seems to take some time.",0
Then there was the sheer tackyness of it all.,0
"eeek it was blinding, all those bright colors.",0
"I think that it is possible that if you had a younger family they would have enjoyed it more, mine consisted of my mid 40's parents my 20yr old friend and I and my 16 yr old brother and his friend.",0
There were way too many little kids.,0
The pool was a source of frustration for us also.,0
"We really wanted to swim but in a bit more privacy, you can forget about it at the All star resort.",0
There is one giant pool and its always filled to the brim with small children.,0
Also my parents had a major issue with some teenage kids having a party in the room next to theres...yeah they called the desk...still it just doesn't seem disney.,1
"Basically, we concluded that we would pay the extra 20 or so dollars a night to stay in a different themed resort which would feel more disneyish to us.",0
"So probably depending on the age of your family, how important staying on ground and saving that little extra cash is and how calm you want your out of park experience to be you might enjoy your stay there.",0
"But, my suggestion is to pick a mid range resort and go with that.",0
Something like Caribean or Port Orleans.,0
"I have stayed at many Ritz-Carlton properties, and I will start by adding that one of my favorite resorts anywhere is the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua on Maui.",0
"However, the experience we had at the Ritz-Carlton Boston was completely uncharacteristic of my other experiences and can only be summed up by saying it was HORRIBLE.",0
"My mother and I went to Boston a few years ago for a week as a part of a trip to New England, and we chose the Ritz instead of the Four Seasons since we tend to favor the chain in our travels.",0
"We loved the location, which is right across the street from the Public Gardens and Boston Common.",0
"The hotel is located a block from the T ( subway ) on the green line, which was also very convenient to use for getting around to go shopping and dining.",0
The interiors are rather old and in desperate need of the facelift that it is now receiving.,0
"However, it was nt the aging interiors that turned us off to this property, so facelift or no, a makeover would nt be enough to draw us back to the Ritz-Carlton Boston.",1
"From the moment we arrived, we were put-off by the snooty attitudes of the staff, but we didn't think too much of it.",1
"Our room was in the older half of the hotel overlooking Newbury Street, which wed requested instead of the newer addition on the opposite side of the hotel.",0
Friends of ours had stayed in both the old and new areas and had discouraged us from the newer addition.,0
"We arrived in the late afternoon, so we dropped our bags off in our room and went out in search of a light meal.",0
"When we returned to our room, there was a flower arrangement awaiting us with no card, so we assumed that this was an amenity since my mother works in the travel industry.",1
"We settled in, and a little later we received a phone call that room service wanted to deliver a fruit tray to us.",0
"We assumed again that this was an amenity as there was no mention of it being a gift, and we declined having it delivered right then.",1
We instead arranged for delivery the next day since we'd already eaten that evening and wanted to turn in early.,0
"The next day we received a phone call from a close friend and client of my mother's, and after an awkward few minutes, she asked how we enjoyed the gifts she'd arranged for us.",0
"I'm sure she felt rather uncomfortable having to ask us at all, but she thought it was strange that we'd not mentioned it.",1
Imagine our surprise when she told us that she was the one who had sent us the flowers!,0
"She had also arranged for a cheese tray with my favorite cheeses to be delivered, not a fruit tray, and had specified that they be waiting when we arrived since she knew wed be famished after over 12 hours of flying.",1
She had also sent a check ahead of time and asked the concierge to purchase a gift certificate to Legal Seafood for us to enjoy during our stay and had mailed a hand-written note well in advance to be displayed with these wonderful gifts when we arrived.,0
All of this was paid for in advance with a generous tip included for the concierge.,0
We immediately took this matter up with management who denied any knowledge of these arrangements.,0
"They never apologized, and we never saw the gift certificate, the hand-written note, or the cheese!",1
The final insult was their response to our friend.,0
"When she called to complain, they lied to her and told her that wed refused the cheese tray delivery and had indeed received the gift certificate and note, and when she told them that shed spoken to us and knew this was nt true, they told her that we were the liars!",1
"She followed up with a letter to their corporate offices, but even that was responded to with a form letter and no personal addressing to the problems.",1
"She and her husband, both frequent, affluent travelers, refuse to stay at any Ritz-Carlton properties since then.",0
"Following our complaints, we received unwelcome glares walking through the lobby, which only served to anger us further.",0
But the story does nt end there.,1
"If you can even believe it, it gets worse.",0
"After a few days of being at the hotel, we awoke one morning to the most awful smell. ",0
"We could nt figure out what it was, but we were choking on it.",0
"I opened the window to our room, and my mother called downstairs for maintenance.",0
"It took them over an hour to arrive, and when the hotel repairman did finally arrive, he told us the Freon from the fridge had leaked or some similar problem.",0
"I dont know much about things of that sort, but whatever leaked intoxicated the air.",1
"They removed the fridge, which apparently the entire floor of the hotel had complained about, but you know where they put it?",0
In a maintenance closet on the same floor!,0
So the stench/choking smell  lingered on the entire floor.,0
This was just too much!,0
"We called downstairs again, and fully expecting understanding of the problem, asked to be moved to another room.",0
"Simple request, right?",0
They told us no!,0
We were outraged!,0
"We were fully prepared to move to the Four Seasons, but we had only one more night and felt it was nt worth the trouble, that wed simply never return to their Boston property again.",1
Id also like to comment on the restaurants.,0
"We did not dine in the formal Dining Room upstairs, but we did enjoy a less-formal meal at the cafe on the first floor facing Newbury Street.",1
"I have no complaints about spending money on fine dining, but the food here was overpriced and uninspired.",1
My mother summed it up as mundane at best.,0
"They had a harpist playing, which was nice, but we were unimpressed with the rest of the experience.",0
"The waitstaff, however, was attentive and more than satisfactory in their service.",0
"Despite our unfortunate experiences with the concierge, front desk, and management, we did have compliments for a few other staff members that did help to brighten our overall dismal stay.",0
"The doormen recognized us and chatted with us each day when wed return from shopping or sightseeing, and they remembered our names and details about us, which was nice.",0
"Since the hotel has the only working, manned elevator today, the elevators have attendants  to run them, and one of them allowed me to work it one night, which was fun.",0
"We also spent an evening in the lounge, and this was by far the only true highlight of our experience.",0
The pianist John was so terrific; he knew every tune you could imagine.,0
"He actually got everybody in the lounge singing together at one point, and when the waiter came for our drink order, my mom tried something new on his recommendation and was more than satisfied with the concoction he chose.",0
"Besides these few gems, though, it was terrible beyond my worst travel nightmares.",0
"It was little surprise to us when, shortly after our stay, the property was demoted from a five-diamond property.",0
"If you want a convenient location, excellent service, and fine accommodations, move about one block down to the Four Seasons.",0
Website: www.ritzcarlton.com/hotels/boston/,0
I recently stayed at the Stratosphere hotel for eight days.,0
Although the check in was impressively quick for Las Vegas that is where the first class service ended.,0
My husband and I got to our room after 12 hours of travel exhausted.,0
"The room had a unidentifiable stain on the floor which kind of looked like blood, but I cannot be sure.",0
The bathtub was dirty - I had to clean it out before I went in there.,0
"The lighting in the sink area was dim, and for us girls and make up you prefer the bright lights.",0
Not to mention the fact that there was a sound that traveled overhead of the room that sounded like a train on tracks.,1
We never determined preciously what the sound was.,1
"We were too far from the elevators, the roller coaster on top of the tower does not operate all night long, so that left us curious, but anxious to move rooms.",1
The manager upgraded us to a player suite which did have better lighting and a marble topped bathroom.,0
"It also had an extra room with a small chair in it - I would have been outraged if I would have paid the extra $ 20 a night this room was supposidly worth, but we got the upgrade for free so it was fine.",0
"We changed rooms late at night and I noticed there was not a"" Do Not Disturb"" sign.",1
I called housekeeping and requested one and they suggested to simply place the sign outside the door for us since it was late.,0
The next morning we discovered that we did not have any hot water unless you took a shower early in the morning as we had done on our first day there ( 3 hour time difference from east to west coast ).,1
The shower was luke warm - almost cold so we thought we could combat the cold shower by heating the room.,0
Most of the time hotel rooms can get extremely warm even beyond the point of comfort.,0
"Not this room, there was no heat so after the luke warm shower we were faced without the comfort of a warm room.",1
"Not to mention the fact that after my cold shower I placed my towel on the floor and was on my way out of the bathroom when the maid walked in with me in my birthday day because we never got that"" Do Not Disturb"" sign as promised.",1
"The housekeeping manager did treat my husband and I to the"" American Superstars"" show in the hotel, which actually was a wonderful performance, but that did not completely supress my anger and embarrassment for myself and I'm sure the maid as well.",1
"My only other positive thing I will say is that they have a wonderful restaurant called,"" Top of the World"" which is located at the top of the tower.",0
It is a revolving restaurant and you can see an entire view of Las Vegas in an hour time frame.,0
"We sat right near the window, had an expensive, but truely good meal and a lovely evening.",0
Reservations are recommended and you can go to the observation deck for free if you eat there.,0
Although the managers were apologetic and as helpful as can be I still believe some staples to hotel living are hot water and do not disturb signs.,1
I would never stay there again.,1
I would never recommend someone to stay there.,1
"Sure, go see the show and have a meal, but don't sleep there.",1
It was one of the worst hotels I have ever been in and quite frankly it tainted my stay in Las Vegas a little.,0
"Oh yes, I almost forgot, on the web site they claim they have three pools.",0
That appears to be untrue.,0
"The have one pool on the 8th floor, I was told the one on the 24th floor was closed and there was no mention of one on the 6th floor.",1
"You can see their""pool facts"" on http://www.stratospherehotel.com/pool.html.",0
"The casino seemed to be like every other casino in Vegas, with the exception of $ 2.00 BlackJack all day and night.",0
It was more geared to those on a budget I suppose.,0
Our selection of the Casa Marina for our winter vacation this year was based on our pleasant experience at the sister hotel'Wyndham Reach' adjacent to the property.,0
Last year we stayed at the Reach and visited the Casa Marina and were intrigued by the setting and facilities.,0
"This year we booked ourselves, our two year old and my sister into the' Casa Marina Resort', with expectations of having a first class experience.",0
"Unfortunately, our vacation was anything but that.",0
"In all fairness, before I present my laundry list of problems with our rooms, I must say that for the most part the staff was friendly and helpful.",0
The older part of the hotel is quite beautiful and has a wonderful yesteryear romantic quality to it.,0
The landscaping is lush and mature and the pools are a pleasure to relax in and around.,0
"The beach at the hotel is adequate, but remember, Key West is not really known for its beaches, so our expectations weren't very high on that point.",1
Now the bad and sad part...,0
"We booked two rooms for March 8 through March 15 ( high season ) a double for my sister, and a mini-suite ocean view for ourselves, $ 359 and $ 379 respectively.",0
We had requested adjoining rooms.,0
"Our check in was fairly normal, except for the expected"" we don't have the adjoining room available"".",1
"Okay, well, we can live with that.",0
The bellman had difficultly figuring out how to get to our rooms!,0
"There was a"" security guard"" there that also had no idea where our rooms were!",1
"That certainly didn't make me feel secure in any way--what kind of"" security guard"" doesn't know the lay of the land in the hotel he works?",1
"I mentioned the'older' part of the hotel before, there is also a'newer' part with rooms and courtyard set up much like any cheap motel anywhere in the country.",0
And boy was it ever.,0
This section was where our rooms were located.,0
"We were on the top floor ( 4th ) and did have ocean views, through the dense palm treetops.",0
The rooms were however filthy.,0
"The door to the room had a problem with the latching device it didn't function properly half the time and the bottom of the door was rusting and rotting, dropping bits and pieces of sharp metal onto the carpet ( not good for a two year olds little feet! ).",1
"Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was the almost dark brown staining on the carpet, running the entire length of the room.",0
There was also a kind of wet moldy smell in the room even though the air conditioning was going full blast.,0
"I thought,'well, okay, let's give it a chance' We were all so excited to be in a warm place after such a long mean winter we just started unpacking and hit the pool and beach immediately.",0
"Over the next day, there were more things that really started to get to me.",0
"There was thick black mold on the inner shower curtain liner, the bathroom floor had a dirty footprint in the corner that the housekeeper just never seemed to pay attention to.",1
"The floor grout was disgusting, it seems they only wipe the floor and never scrubbed it clean!",1
The wallpaper was peeling at all the seams ( wallpaper is a dumb idea in tropical weather anyway ).,0
The towel/rack shelf thing was bent and falling off of the wall.,0
The shower drain was rusty and unclean.,0
"I know this is pretty standard, but the water pressure was more like a spritzer bottle than a shower!",0
The light fixture had two'energy saver' fluourescent bulbs in it that took a very long time to heat up and light the bathroom.,0
All of this horror was packed into a teeny tiny cramped little bathroom!,0
"The crib we had requested was covered in dirt and dust, the sheets/pillow were clean the but the crib looked like is had been stored outside.",0
"One of the wheels was totally broken off, creating a lopsided slope.",0
I had to clean off the thing myself with a wet washcloth and use some magazines to level the crib so the kid could sleep in it without sliding into one corner!,1
"The rest of the room was okay, a bit run down, the decor was probably nice 10 or 15 years ago when it was done, but the materials and finishes weren't of high enough quality and definitely were deteriorating fast.",1
Out of three bed pillows two had dark stains on them and smelled really foul.,0
The bed skirt on the bed was six or more inches too long and was very unattractive and had gotten dirty from repeatedly being stepped on and vacummed over.,0
All of the lampshades were stained and loose.,0
The'artwork' consisted of posters that were so faded out that they seemed to be only that funny blue color with a yellow white background.,0
The mini-bar was adequately and expensively stocked but the laminate surfaces were peeling away at the edges and there was a ton of dust and dirt laying around either side of it.,0
There was a safe in the closet--but it was completely useless!,0
The instructions had worn away so long ago it was good for nothing but taking up space.,0
"A quick glance at the climate control and the air vents, showed massive amounts of dust accumulation.",0
"Our'suite' was nothing more than a standard room with one king bed, and a small sofa and chair jammed into the other corner, a totally generic'shoebox' of a room that even a discount chain hotel would be embarassed to lay claim to.",0
"Oh, by the way, the balcony was spacious.",0
"Okay, whew.",0
"Well we've stayed in all types of hotels, resorts, guesthouses, villas etc. all over the world.",0
We spend anywhere between 20K and 50K a year on travel and this next thing was unbelievable to us.,0
Later that morning,0
"after returning from the pool, we were walking around our room in our bare feet and noticed something weird.",0
"While we had clean feet ( in our sandals ) back from the pool, our feet were TURNING BLACK from walking around the room on the carpeting!",0
I couldn't believe this.,0
This has to be one of the all time most disgusting things I have ever experienced in any hotel anywhere.,0
"That was it, I called to talk to the manager.",0
I asked that we have a face to face meeting instead of just speaking on the phone.,0
I went to the front desk and we sat down and I presented him with a list of the problems and wanted to have our rooms switched.,0
What was the response?,0
""" We'll see what we can do"","" The hotel is completely booked""""blah, blah, blah, blah,"" I wasn't completely satisfied but I said"" Okay, let me know what you can do as soon as you know.",1
"But please don't call the room before 4:00 because the baby is sleeping.""",1
I didn't know what to expect since I have rarely if ever had as many complaints here as anywhere else.,1
He asked for a copy of my list and I presented it to him.,0
"Later that afternoon, a staff member tries to open our door without knocking at 3:30 pm and is barging in with a plastic shower curtain!",1
I told him to come back later.,0
A few more minutes before 4:00 another person is banging on the door.,0
This is really unbelievable.,0
I specifically said not to disturb us before 4:00 nap time was over.,1
So much for first-class service.,0
I immediately called the manager again ( after getting our child settled down ) and had to just cut loose.,0
He asked if our'problems' had been resolved!,0
"Um, no! So, he finally offered to move rooms, not very convenient for us, but I couldn't stand another minute in that room.",1
"The new room was in the same section and almost just as bad, but it didn't smell and I knew we would be out of there in a few days never to return to this hotel or any Wyndham Hotel anywhere in the world--EVER.",1
So this was our'accommodation' trading one dirty room for another.,0
Apologies from the staff: None.,0
We had a terrific time in Key West as long as we didn't spend a minute more than we had to in our so-called'luxury' rooms.,1
"I will never recommend this hotel to any family, friend, co-worker, or stranger on the street.",1
Wyndham has a lot of work to do if this is what is considered top-drawer.,0
"It's been one week since I laid my head down in Palace Station, advertised as the place to stay for Vegas locals.",0
I'm still shuddering--and my suitcase still reeks of cigarette smoke--after being there for less than 10 hours.,0
"The place was a dump--a supreme, run-down, dirty, less-than-customer-focused, dive.",0
"Granted, I paid very little for the room ( $ 35 plus tax, about $ 42 total ).",0
I didn't expect anything fancy.,0
"What I got was an experience so rancid, I nearly canceled my good night in Vegas later in the week.",0
Location,0
"Off the strip--and not in the nicest area, either.",1
My cab ride from the airport cost $ 34--thanks to the ripoff artist who took me all over the city.,0
How would I have known?,0
My return fare cost $ 8.,0
Check-in,0
I don't care if it was 2 am--she could have TRIED to get me a non-smoking room.,1
Or a room somewhat close to the main building.,0
"Instead, I ended up in a smoker, a LONG walk from the front desk; a walk that included an outdoor component through the service area, where several attractive, thin women in mighty short skirts were huddled.",0
They seemed awfully disappointed when I stomped out the door--but perked up when a man came out.,0
Offered him their company.,0
Hmmmm.,0
The Room,0
"Like I said, for $ 35, it's not bound to be luxurious.",1
"But for that rate, I want my key to work.",0
"When it didn't, I found a casino phone, called for help, and hunkered down to wait for security.",0
"While I was waiting, a man offered me $ 20 for 15 minutes.",0
I declined.,0
"Sure, it's better money than epinions.com,",0
"but hey, I have principles.",0
"$ 5 to the security guy and a 10 minute key struggle later, I was in, locks bolted and AC cranking.",0
The window had both metal and concrete cages.,0
"The bed was a king, surprisingly firm, with clean sheets.",0
"A small armoire housed a TV with cable, and a small table and chairs rounded up the furniture.",0
"Cheap indeed, but functional.",0
Truly hideous color scheme--sort of a brown and orange theme.,0
"There was also a large safe, but that required a $ 2 daily fee and I was just there to crash.",0
Can You Call it a Bathroom if it only has a shower?,0
"Small, functional, and clean, with slippery tiles and a small toilet.",0
Corner shower stall was tiny and efficient.,0
They did provide soap and shampoo.,0
Casino,0
"In the morning, I decided to play a little.",0
Real little.,0
I had 5 minutes and $ 50.,0
"After wasting $ 10 in quarters, I sat at a 5 cent machine, popped in $ 5, and promptly won the max jackpot of $ 300.",0
"That, my friends, was the highlight of my stay.",0
"The casino attendant paid me quickly, in big bills, and seemed pleased when I tipped her.",0
"Granted, it was early, but the casino was fairly empty, and held none of the typical Las Vegas glitz.",1
"If anything, the atmosphere was sort of a 7-11 at 3 am feel--everyone bleary-eyed, pathetic, and desperate.",0
Shops and Restaurants,0
I didn't bother.,1
"The gift shops were bigger than I expected, with the usual assortment of Vegas merchandise.",0
"Restaurants include the usual mix--buffet, cafe, Tex-Mex, Italian, Steak, and Asian.",0
"Room service was available, but I satisfied myself with snack mix and water from the plane.",0
"With all the creatures crawling in the hallways, I had no desire to meet anything from behind the scenes.",1
Bottom line,0
"Never, never, never again.",1
I sacrificed safety and convenience for the illusion of a low price--and ended up spending the same amount I would've spent for a nice room on the strip.,0
Never mind my $ 300 win.,1
This place was the worst hotel I've ever endured.,0
Run!,0
"I recently spent a week in Las Vegas ( again! ), and this time decided to stay off of the Strip and out of the classic Downtown area.",0
I stayed the entire week at Palace Station.,0
"I hate to say it, but what a mistake that was.",0
Don't get me wrong.,1
Palace Station is a great place...if you're a local and like to gamble.,0
"You see, all of the promotions ( money and prize giveaways ) are geared towards the locals.",0
"They give prizes away, but while I was visiting, they were only giving them away weekly.",0
"So, if, like me, you arrive on a Saturday, and are leaving on Thursday, you miss the Friday drawings!",0
Yikes!,0
"While playing there, I earned a bunch of free tickets to use to enter the drawings, but I had to be PRESENT TO WIN.",0
What a letdown.,0
"With that said, the dealers are overall a pretty friendly lot.",0
"It appears they see a lot of regulars, so they welcome a fresh face now and then and ask genuine questions about you.",0
I wouldn't recommend the food.,0
The Mexican grill was bad - the food was stale.,0
The diner's service was s l o w.,0
Did I say slow?,0
I meant non-existent.,0
I tried the pool a few days as the temperatures were in the high 90's.,0
Get out early as by noon it is taken over by children.,0
"However, it was a nice way to wake up and start the day - nothing quite like a dip in the pool at 8am when it's already 88 degrees.",0
"Take note that if you don't rent a car, it will cost you between $ 11-13 each way to get to the Downtown casinos.",1
"That's right, they don't offer a shuttle service to the Downtown area.",1
"Also, the shuttles that run to and from the Strip stop at midnight.",0
What Vegas visitor wants to leave the Strip at midnight?,0
That's when the action picks up.,0
I won't be staying at Palace Station again.,1
I'll get back to everyone when I get back from my next trip.,0
"In the meantime, have fun, win big, and win often!",0
My husband and I got married in Las Vegas in April 1996.,0
We stayed at the Palace Station because it was a good deal and out of the way of all of the confusion on the strip.,0
We just loved it!,0
Everyone was very kind and helpful.,0
The casino is the best around....the food is absolutely the best!,0
"The room was nice, however, we did not spend much time in the room.",1
In Vegas one does not sleep very much in the town that never sleeps!!!,1
"So, of course, we decided to stay here again on our next trip in 1999.",0
What a mistake!,0
"The food was still wonderful, the casino is still the only won I could win ANY money at, but the service was not up to par.",1
"Our room, with the nasty old carpet and the hole in the bathroom door, was not what I expected after spending so much money for a vacation!",1
"While inquiring about tickets to a show we were told"" I don't know, call them and find out""!",1
"As for taking the shuttle to the strip, plan to wait at least 30 minutes to an hour!",0
The service on the casino floor was very slow at times.,0
At one point I ordered a drink after tracking down a waitress and she never returned.,1
"However, I did see her serving the higher priced machines a couple of minutes later.",0
"I am a very good tipper, which is very important in this town.",0
On our next trip we are planning to stay elsewhere!,0
I stayed here for three nights while in Fort Lauderdale on business.,0
"And while this hotel is in dire need of refurbishment, it's location makes up for some of its short comings.",0
I checked into the Sheraton Yankee Clipper Hotel in early December'02.,0
"My accommodations were in the beach tower; in order to get to them, I had to go back outside and walk through the parking area.",0
"I had a standard ocean view room with typical Sheraton amenities including a king sized bed, 20 inch color TV with cable, computer hook-up, a decent sized bathroom and plenty of complementary toiletries.",0
It was obvious that the room had been updated recently with new window treatments and upholstery.,0
"However, the carpeting was stained in places, the furniture somewhat roughed up and the sliding door to the closet ( which wasn't a big deal ) wouldn't close all the way.",0
"The clean bath towels provided by the hotel were rough, thin and small.",0
The pillows on the bed were old and flat.,0
"I had to request extra pillows, and even the ones brought to the room were just as as bad.",0
"All hotel towels were the same quality; although I had lots of extras, they were all thin and worn.",0
"The bed itself was quite hard, and by the third night, I was dreading having to sleep on it.",0
All the beds I checked out seem to be on a concrete platform.,0
"Some people, including my husband, might prefer this arrangement.",0
"However, it was too stiff for me to ever feel comfortable.",0
The hotel was situated in a fairly good location.,0
The wide stretch of beach along Fort Lauderdale's waterfront was spectacular.,0
"Unfortunately, the lounge chairs and umbrellas on the beach were owned by a concession who charged $ 15/day.",0
I refused to pay this amount to enjoy a few hours in the sun.,0
"But most people I spoke to paid to do so, as the hotel's pool areas ( two of them ) consisted of a square pool, concrete decking and few lounge chairs and some tables with umbrellas and chairs.",0
"I found the pool areas ( one near the beach and one enclosed in between the hotel towers ) to be clean, but it had a motel like feel to it.",0
"Considering my employer paid a corporate rate ( $ $ $ ), I would have thought for the money, this hotel would have been typical of other Sheraton resorts elsewhere.",0
No so.,1
"There was a restaurant on the premises, which always seemed empty, a quiet lounge with happy hour munchies ( not bad ) and entertainment ( at least when I was there ).",1
"The vast majority of clientele, from what I could tell, were foreign visitors on holiday or airline employees staying the night.",0
Some of the people I ran into on Sunday night were there as part of a pre-cruise package.,0
"Either way, it appears, most people used this hotel only to sleep and to freshen-up by night and go elsewhere for entertainment by day.",0
"The Sheraton Yankee Clipper had a large motel feel to it, not at all in line with it's size, location and price.",1
Other hotels in the area had landscaped pool areas where clientele spent more time enjoying the facilities.,0
"One couple I met who was taking a cruise the next day, said they were able to get one night here for $ 40 through Priceline.",0
I think my employer paid about $ 130/night ( corporate rates are pretty high ).,0
One other couple I had met who arranged to stay here with a cruise line said they paid $ 90/night.,0
I wouldn't pay more than $ 60-$ 70/night to stay here - in line with what you would pay at some of the other motels near the beach in the area.,0
"If there was one positive aspect, it was the hotel's location.",0
"Across the street at the Bahia Mar Hotel, is the water taxi stop.",0
"For a few bucks, you can take the water taxi to excellent restaurants, shopping and points of interest and tour the mansions of Fort Lauderdale along the water ways while in transit.",0
I found it enjoyable during the day as well as at night.,0
The beach front by the hotel also offers the best beach volleyball in Fort Lauderdale; good competition if you play and fun to watch if you don't.,1
"There are good restaurants a short walk away, and public transportation that picks you up and drops you off at the front of the hotel.",0
Cab fare to and from the airport or Port Everglades was around $ 12 including tip.,0
"So, would I come back here again?",0
Probably not.,1
"For a one night stay, it's probably fine, but given the fact that the Embassy Suites or Amerisuites both have comparable prices and much better amenities ( though NOT on the beach ), I would be inclined to recommend one of them for a pre or post cruise stay.",1
"On the other hand, if I got the Sheraton Yankee Clipper from a winning Priceline bid of $ 30 or $ 40, I'd consider it a great deal, regardless of my opinion.",0
"Don't forget, my employer paid a lot to have me stay here; under similar circumstances, I'd recommend going elsewhere.",1
Good luck!,0
I bid for a 3 star on Priceline in the Lake Buena Vista area.,0
This property is located in Kissimmee on 192 ( NOT Lake Buena Vista ).,1
"The hotel was clean, attractive, pleasant front desk staff.",0
The airconditioning was extremely noisy.,0
There were Bath and Body Works ammenities in the guest rooms.,0
"Unfortunately, I would not classify it as"" secure.""",1
"The first thing I found""odd"" were the room doors.",0
"There was the normal latch up top, the dead bolt and an extra dead bolt?",0
That seemed odd.,0
"Everyday when I returned to the hotel, I found pizza fliers under my door ( this is a scam happening in the Orlando area; they obtain your credit card # /# and have fun with it; they attempt to rob you if you order a pizza and they deliver it... ).",0
Security was extremely lax.,0
"I saw a security officer once, on the morning I was leaving the hotel, on the elevator.",0
"If you were coming into the hotel from the outside, you could gain access from any door without using a room key.",1
"I was scheduled to stay for 6 nites, after 3 nites, I left.",0
I was a female traveling by myself and did not feel safe here.,1
I left and checked into The Hotel Royal Plaza on Hotel Plaza Boulevard where the Security was stepped up.,0
"Although the property was clean and attractive, safety is paramount.",0
"I would not recommend this property for this reason, and this reason alone.",1
"It would be foolish to put some clever title on the review of this hotel, because it is exactly what it is.",0
"A beautiful hotel, in a perfect location, with large rooms, and an architectural design beyond belief.",0
We visited this resort for our 25th wedding anniversary.,0
"We traveled in March, which tends to be the high rain season, and it seems that every time we visit a beach resort it rains.",0
"It rained every day, as we were in the midst of a minor storm that had done some damage to the islands.",0
"Maybe that is why we take more cruises, as the ship keeps moving, and the rain can't be there forever.",1
"We booked this trip with United Vacations, and since we had not started traveling as much as we do now, I"" trusted"" their opinions.",1
"I did have some concern because the big hurricane had done severe damage to the island, and we were coming just a year later.",0
"I was assured by the United Vacations representative that the island was in perfect condition, which was not the case.",1
"However, since that was more than five years ago, no doubt all the damage has been fixed, and the vegetation has grown back.",1
"However, I would not recommend United Vacations unless you have really done your homework concerning your chosen destination.",1
The hotel is a very open concept design that sits on 50 acres of the Poipu Beach District of Kauai.,0
"The grounds were beautiful, and the interior of the hotel was open to the outside, as were all the halls to the various destinations of the hotel.",0
"Everything was protected from the elements, and it gave you a very tropical feeling.",0
"In the lobby were a beautiful collection of live, native birds, of magnificent colors, some in cages, and some sitting on perches.",0
"Marble and oriental rugs, lush tropical fresh flowers were everywhere.",0
There is nothing about this hotel that would be a disappointment.,0
"There are 602 rooms spread out over the large hotel area, and they are only on two floors.",0
"We had booked a standard room, but I did call the hotel and let them know it was our anniversary, and we received a complimentary upgrade to the Regency Club.",0
The Regency Club consisted of 40 incredibly beautiful room with a private access lounge.,0
"The room was large, king size bed, interesting furniture, and comfortable chairs, and a patio or balcony depending on the floor you were on.",0
I am always fascinated with the bathrooms in these hotels.,0
"This was again marble, in two compartments, with sliding doors that open up to the room.",0
The Regency Club was the best one we have ever experienced.,0
"We could not believe the food that they put out, starting with breakfast and ending with evening drinks.",1
"Breakfast contained anything you wanted, lunch was a nice snack, and the evening snacks....well, there was so much food we never ate dinner in a week.",1
"Every night they had a different theme for dinner, and since there was so much to eat, and drink, why pay for a meal.",0
"The decor was very comfortable, tropical, and became our little meeting area with friends, because the weather was so bad.",0
The beach is supposed to be great.,0
"The whole time we were there the red flag was up, so we didn't get in the water.",1
"There are two large swimming pools connected by a river like park, and a sand beach.",0
"The weather did give us a little break, and we enjoyed this so much.",0
The children were having a great time with all the facilities at the pool.,0
The sand area is around a five acre saltwater lagoon.,0
"Frankly, they didn't even need a beach!",1
One day I had to go to the Spa.,0
"I decided on a package that had a facial, partial massage, and manicure.",0
"The price was about $ 100, and it took the whole afternoon.",0
"The total spa area is 25,000 sq ft, and has it's own partially enclosed pool, elaborate exercise facility, and lava rock showers.",0
"This hotel is a real winner, complete with it's own 18 hole golf course.",0
"Although I would be cautious about the time of year I visited, I would say there is no way you could be disappointed in your stay here.",1
"The Hyatt Regency in Kauai comes very close to being a top notch hotel, in my opinion.",0
We stayed at the Hyatt on our honeymoon - it was the first stop in a two-week honeymoon that took us to 3 hotels ( Four Seasons in Maui and Four Seasons in Kona being the other two ).,0
"Since this was the first stop, we didn't have the other hotels to compare this one to.",0
That was probably smart because nothing can compare to the Four Seasons.,0
My biggest complaint about the hotel is that they charge you a daily fee for parking.,0
They charge you whether you choose valet or self park.,0
"Valet is more expensive, of course, but they charge for both.",0
I found this an unnecessary charge for such an upscale hotel.,0
"Okay, now that that is behind us, let's talk about the beauty of this hotel.",0
The grounds are breathtaking.,0
They landscaped it so that you feel as if you are in a tropical paradise.,0
The best part of the grounds is the lagoon and pools.,0
The pools are all freshwater.,0
"We're not talking about a standard rectangular pool - the pools are like meandering paths that curve around and go under foot bridges, under rock bridges, etc.",1
The pools are on multiple levels with waterfalls between the levels.,0
All around the pools are sun decks with lounge chairs.,0
And then there is the lagoon.,0
The lagoon is salt water with an artificial sand-like bottom.,0
I say sand-like because the sand pieces are way too large to be natural sand.,0
"When I first saw this, I couldn't understand why they used it but it became apparent.",0
"When walking on it, it doesn't stick to your feet!",1
The individual pieces are too big!,0
How clever.,0
"Swimming in the lagoon was more fun than the pools, in my opinion, because it felt more like swimming in a natural setting.",0
The deep end of the lagoon is also used for scuba diving classes.,0
The room.,0
We had a large room with a balcony that contained a king bed and a full bed.,0
I'm not sure if we were upgraded because it was our honeymoon or if because they were only at 40 % occupancy at the time but who cares.,0
I have two minor complaints about the room - the very small TV - I don't know the exact dimensions of it but it was definitely smaller than a 20 inch.,1
The other complaint was the bathroom.,0
I guess I am spoiled thinking back to the Four Seasons bathroom and I guess it is unfair to compare them because the Hyatt bathroom was completely adequate - just not up to par with the Four Seasons.,1
Our package at the Hyatt included free continental breakfast every morning.,0
This is key.,0
To pay for a full breakfast at these hotels will set you back a hefty sum so the free all-you-can-eat setup was a definite plus.,0
We ate in an open air setting adjacent to a small pond with swans.,0
Perfect.,0
The main lobby of the hotel is beautiful - kind of indoors and kind of outdoors.,0
"Actually, the entire hotel is kind of indoors and kind of outdoors.",0
There will be a room with an entire wall that just isn't there.,0
A bit hard to describe but you'll know what I mean when you see it.,0
Makes you wonder what they do in bad weather.,0
"Although the hotel is situated adjacent to a beach, the beach is not among the best I've seen.",1
"First of all, the water is way too rough in this part of Kauai to swim in.",0
The beach itself was a big narrow and not the clean white sand you think of when thinking of Hawaii.,1
"Also, the hotel is on the southeast side of the island so there were no sunsets over the water.",1
We did see some very nice rainbows though!,0
We ate in all the restaurants at the hotel at least once.,0
All excellent and exactly what you'd expect at an expensive hotel.,0
"The cost of dinner for two can easily exceed $ 100 with wine, etc. so be careful.",0
I would have liked a complimentary newspaper each morning but that would have cost extra...,0
"If you are into spas, I'm told the Hyatt's is above average in quality and in price.",0
Not too surprising - that is a recurring theme at this hotel.,1
I didn't go to the spa myself so I cannot comment on it.,1
"On the one rainy day we experienced, we asked the concierge what there is to do when it rains.",0
We were told to go to the movies or to go bowling.,0
I did not go all the way to Hawaii to do either of those.,1
We were on our honeymoon so we didn't really care about being stuck in our room while it rained.,0
What a great Tahoe hotel!,0
"An older resort, it is nice although somewhat unspectacular when you drive up for the first time.",0
"Then, when you walk out of the snow and into the lobby....well, WOW!",0
"The expansive lobby area is dark, warm, and decorated in beautiful, rustic, mountain chic...with lots of dark wood, stone, and high beams.",0
"Big fireplaces were going with cozy leather furniture groupings around each, almost begging us to curl up there with a warming libation.",0
"My husband and I visited the week before Christmas, and the numerous, beautifully decorated lobby trees only enhanced the ambiance.",0
"Service was good, if rather laid-back.",0
"This was not necessarily a bad thing, but was rather in keeping with the general tone of this quaint, slow-paced resort town.",1
"It was there if you needed it, but not in the in-your-face-everywhere-you-turn sort of way that it is, for instance, on a cruise ship.",1
"The hotel employees were generally informal, friendly and helpful.",0
The only negative that comes to mind was a kiosk set up near the main elevators from which time-share hawkers continuously beckoned hotel guests as they came to and from their rooms.,0
"Walking by several times per day was almost unavoidable, and we were somewhat rabidly solicited about half a dozen times during our 5-night visit.",0
"We got a King Hotel Room, and we were extremely happy with it.",0
"It was newly decorated ( and looked it ), furnished in sort of a rustic-yet-contemporary style with an earthtone pallette.",0
"We had a spacious, well lighted bathroom ( always a big plus for me! ), large closet, mini-bar, armoire with television, work/entertainment table and chairs, and what was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.",0
"The bed had a fantastic mattress and box spring ( which is sometimes aggravatingly absent ), and TWO sheets with a soft, thermal blanket between them.",0
"It was topped with a heavy down comforter, and was just fabulous to sink into after a day of skiing while the snow swirled and wind howled outside.",0
"We were on the 7th floor, and had a breathtaking view from our large windows of both the mountains and lake.",0
The resort boasts an absolutely beautiful restaurant and lounge called the Lone Eagle Grille.,0
"You do have a short walk to get to it, as it is located across the street ( directly on the shore of Lake Tahoe ).",0
"Well worth the hike, even in the snow.",0
"It was built in a 1920's lakefront lodge style, and is exquisitely warm and romantic.",0
"Huge picture windows face out over the lake, and outdoor fireplaces were burning on the lakefront patio where a well-bundled, impervious-to-cold crowd sipped cocktails.",0
"Inside, large fireplaces burned continuously and more of the vintage mountain decor prevailed.",0
"On one side, a light appetizer menu was served along with an extensive list of martinis and other libations.",0
"The other side of the lodge is an upscale restaurant ( which we didn't try, but looked to be doing a land-office business ).",1
"I highly recommend a visit to the cocktail lounge side of the Lone Eagle, at the very least.",0
Try the lobster bisque...it was some of the best we'd ever had.,0
"We didn't have many of our meals at the hotel, but what food we did have was good and fairly priced.",1
"In addition to the appetizers we enjoyed at the Lone Eagle, we also had lunch and drinks at Cutthroat's Saloon ( right off the lobby ).",0
It's one of those Old West throw-your-peanut-shells-on-the-floor places.,0
"it was fun and relaxed, bartenders were great ( thanks, Jeff! ), and both food and beverages were delicious and priced right.",0
"A Cosmopolitan martini was $ 5 at Cutthroat's, as opposed to $ 7.50 at Lone Eagle ( and was quite a bit larger ).",0
"One of the Hyatt's many amenities is a large, beautiful casino right off the hotel lobby which drew an attractive, substantial crowd the weekend we were there.",0
"One word of caution, though...the slots are EXTREMELY tight at the Hyatt.",0
You will very easily run through a $ 20 on a quarter slot machine in less than 10 minutes in that casino ( this is betting one credit at a time ).,0
"I would like to add that I fully expect to lose everything I put into a slot machine, but I would like to get a little entertainment bang for my buck while doing so.",0
We drove about 5 miles to the west to Jim Kelly's Nugget Casino one night ( right on the CA/NV border ) and I played for 45 minutes with one $ 20.,0
"They boast slots that are"" 23 % looser"" according to Nevada gambling statistics.",0
"Based upon my personal experience, it certainly seemed to be the case.",0
"This resort also offers a beautiful new spa on-site with almost any treatment imaginable....from every type of massage, to hair styling, to nails, to skincare.",0
"They also have a sauna, as well as a large jacuzzi and heated pool.",0
"My husband enjoyed an 80 minute Sierra Stone Massage while we were there, and practically had to be poured back into the room afterward.",0
"The special services are not inexpensive, but neither are they outrageous...and they are performed in a lovely, relaxing, professional environment.",1
"The Hyatt is located on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe, which is the quieter side of the lake.",0
"There are plenty of of places to ski all around the lake, and all are relatively centrally located to the resort.",0
You probably won't drive more than 25 miles in either direction to reach the furthermost ski destination you could possibly choose...and the drive is spectacular whichever way you travel.,1
"There are more casinos on the South Shore ( and it is also more congested and touristy ), but having stayed on both sides, I prefer the more quaint and low-key North Shore.",0
Two restaurant recommendations before I wrap up.,0
"If you visit Lake Tahoe, try The Blue Agave on the NW side of the lake.",0
"They serve up some of the freshest, tastiest Mexican food my husband and I have ever eaten ( and he used to live in Mexico! ).",0
"It is a lovely restaurant with a beautiful view of the lake, and is quite inexpensive.",0
"For a memorable dining experience when money is no object, try Le Petit Pier, located in Tahoe Vista ( about 7 miles west of the Hyatt ).",1
It is an adorable French restaurant located right on the lakeshore which has been around for over 30 years.,0
"Le Petit Pier has been featured both on the Food Network and in Wine Spectator Magazine and, after dining there, I can certainly see why.",0
"The wine list was outstanding, and everything we ordered, from Escargot and Fois Gras to Lavender Honey Glazed Duck Breast and Herbed Rack of Lamb, was spectacular!",0
"Every taste was an epicurian delight, right down to the tiny champagne and watermelon sorbet presented as a palate cleanser between courses.",0
"My husband had the Creme Brulee ( with a surprise berry bottom ) for dessert, and proclaimed that he had enjoyed versions of the custard""in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower which were not as wonderful"".",1
"I digress from the purpose of this review, but the meal was so wonderful and the ambiance so romantic, I couldn't help but mention it.",0
"Be prepared to drop some serious change if you go, but you will certainly find it well worth it!",0
"Overall, I would highly recommend the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort and Casino.",0
"Almost everything you could want is under one roof, and everything else is mere minutes away.",0
A perfect Lake Tahoe destination!,0
I have to differ on a few items with beerbuff's review of Hyatt Regency at Lake Tahoe.,0
"I have been going out there now for 5 years, my husband and I travel out there for 8 days and 7 nights, usually the week before Thanksgiving week.",0
"We found Lake Tahoe quite by accident, we were looking for someplace new",0
"to try other than Daytona Florida, since we live in Florida, and the heat",0
we opted to try something on the cool side for a change.,0
Our travel agent recommended Tahoe because it had Mountains which I love and cool weather which both my husband and myself were looking for.,0
"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency, I had written a letter with my reservation to the Hotel and told them how my husband and I were celebrating our 25th anniversary.",0
To our surprise when we checked in the General Manager had,0
upgraged us from the hotel room which runs around $ 165. a night to the,0
Cabins on the Lake across the road by the Lone Eagle Grill.,0
"These rooms run around $ 345. a night, and charged us the $ 165.",0
Hotel Tower rate.,0
The Hyatt is on the North Shore at Incline village which is so quaint and friendly.,0
"The cabins are definitely a must, they are 4 rooms to a cabin, upper and lower, with storage on the main entrance of the cabins for your ski's and ski equipment.",0
"The rooms have two bathrooms, a bedroom with a sitting area, a safe, a Fireplace in the living room, color TV in the living room, bedroom and even in the main bathroom.",0
There is a terrace outside the living room area with a wood deck and chairs to take in the view of the lake.,0
"I recommend renting a 4 wheel drive vehicle, since it is very mountainous.",0
"It is close to Diamond Peak, and Mt. Rose for skiing.",0
We love to hike so we go to the lookout with a hiking trail that takes you down to Vikingsholm,0
castle on the lake.,0
There is also Heavenly for skiing on the South Shore.,0
"Where I beg to differ with beerbuff, is you can gamble in the Casino at Hyatt at Roulette for a minimum $ 2.00 bet.",0
I did for hours and had a great time.,0
"There are nickel, dime and quarter slots, as well as electronic poker machines.",0
They have poker tables in the back for the serious gambler.,0
They have several restaurants inside of the hotel all of which I found to have excellent and reasonably priced food.,0
They have a great breakfast buffet and for $ 20. each morning my husband and I could fill up and not be hungry until almost dinner time.,1
Within a 10 minute scenic drive you can be at McDonalds for breakfast if you prefer when on a budget.,0
"I found if you budget your money in advance for food, souvenir's and gambling, you can have a great and memorable time in Lake Tahoe.",0
"I also recommend joining the Hyatt Gold Passport club, because you can also upgrade to the Cabins on the lake with you member points the price drops down to about $ 245 from $ 345 a night.",0
"You accrue, member points, with every stay at any Hyatt.",0
"Also, with your Gold passport card you get discounts in the Hotels gift shops.",0
"Ahoy there, matey.",0
I stayed at Treasure Island in Las Vegas in late May 2001.,0
"Of my four trips to Vegas, this was my best hotel experience yet.",0
"Treasure Island is excellent for a number of reasons, with location being a top bonus.",0
"Treasure Islands location allows easy access to the strip, and the convenient tram to the Mirage saves time and sun exposure.",0
One of my favorite things about the hotel is that it is very easy to get from the front entrance to the guest elevators.,0
"In other hotels, with NYNY and MGM being prime examples, the guest elevators are obscured in the midst of the casino.",0
"At Treasure Island, it is a straight shot from the door to the guest elevators.",0
The Room,0
Treasure Island boasts its spectacular views of the Pirate Battle or the volcano at the Mirage.,0
"Well, we checked in and had a view of a roof.",0
"Ok, so it was nt quite the Pirate Battle, but how many times did we look out the window during the weekend?",1
About threeand only to make sure the sun was still shining.,0
"The room was a standard size, with two queen beds, a table and chairs, and a TV cabinet There were two mirrored closets, and a roomy bathroom with a large tub.",0
"The beds were comfortable, and everything in the room was in good condition.",0
"With four women in the room, the layout was nt ideal when preparing to go out, but it was still perfectly adequate.",1
"We had enough room to store all of our luggage without tripping over it, and we found enough outlets for our hairdryers, curling irons, immersion heaters, nightlights, etc.",1
Amenities,0
The pool at Treasure Island was a bit disappointing compared to the outstanding pools at the newer hotels.,0
"Even so, it was still nice for a relaxing afternoon swim.",0
"Treasure Island has one main pool, a smaller childrens pool, and a large hot tub.",0
"Lounge chairs, cabanas, and poolside service are readily available.",0
"My main complaint about the pool is that to get to it, guests must walk through the main part of the hotel shopping area, and right past the Mystere theatre.",0
That is not the most comfortable stroll to take when you are dripping wet and unkempt.,1
"I did not try any of the spa services offered at Treasure Island, but they had a nice selection of massages, facials, manicures, etc. available for guests.",1
Dining,0
Treasure Island has several restaurants to choose from.,0
"For casual all-day dining, there is the Terrace Caf.",0
The caf features a standard menu of American meals and snacks.,0
"For something a bit nicer, there is the the Courtyard Grille, with a more Italian menu.",0
"In addition to a number of other casual cafs and snack bars, Treasure Island has several fine-dining establishments.",0
The Buccaneer Bay restaurant offers a gourmet menu and private view of the pirate battle.,0
"For any of the restaurants, it is important to consider reservations and/or waiting time.",0
The Terrace Caf in particular is very busy.,0
"For faster service, opt for a table in the smoking section ( ALL of Vegas is smoky, so it wont matter anyway ).",0
Entertainment,0
Free entertainment is one of my favorite features of Las Vegas.,0
The Pirate Battle at Treasure Island is always an interesting event.,0
"Inside Treasure Island, Cirque du Soleil performs Mystere, a show featuring acrobats, gymnasts, dancers, singers, musicians and clowns from 15 countries.",0
Overall,0
"I would highly recommend Treasure Island to those looking for a comfortable, convenient place to stay at a lower cost.",0
"While it may not be the newest or most spectacular, Treasure Island has nearly as much to offer as the other strip hotels.",1
It is a great'home base' for your trip to Vegas.,0
A little note of interest to those concerned about safety,0
"Late on Sunday afternoon as I was napping, I was jolted awake by the sound of an alarm.",0
"The alarm whooped for a few moments, and then an announcement came on.",0
A calm voice said something to the effect of This is the early warning fire alarm system.,0
Please review the safety instructions in your guest manual.,0
"We will update you after further investigation  I quickly dressed and gathered easy-to-carry valuables, then stood by the map of my fire escape route awaiting further instruction.",0
"I did nt smell smoke or see flames, but heard sirens coming toward the hotel.",1
"After about ten minutes, an all-clear was announced, and everything went back to normal.",0
I have to admit I was impressed by the hotels fire preparedness.,0
Imagine evacuating a giant hotel/casino without clear instructions.,1
"I had nt thought of fire safety before, but it was comforting to know the hotel had a good system.",1
"From the first time you set your eyes on Treasure Island you expect to see pirates coming out to greet you with a hardy"" Ahoy Mateys.""",0
You have to remember that you are in Las Vegas and not on an island full of pirates.,1
Exterior,0
Treasure Island is located right next door to the Mirage Hotel on the Las Vegas strip.,0
The two hotels are connected by a tram that you can ride between the two any time night or day.,0
"This marvelous hotel, upon your arrival, will immediately take you back to the time of Captain Hook.",0
The exterior is well kept and you notice the giant pirate ship right away.,0
At night this ship turns into the battle of good and evil with shows 2 to 3 times a night.,0
To enter the hotel you must walk the board plank into the front door.,0
Once Inside,0
Once inside you will find the pirate theme carried throughout the hotel and casino.,0
The decorations are bright and colorful and the entire place is extremely clean.,0
"We arrived at the front desk ready for check in, we were with a large group from my husband's company, the desk was well staffed and handled this large group very quickly and efficiently.",0
"This being a business meeting for my husband, he was very pleased with a quick check in since it would give him some time in the casino before the first meeting.",0
We were given the key to our room and pointed to elevators with a warm thank you and enjoy your stay.,0
Our Room,0
We found our room very easily and were immediately impressed with the cleanliness and the size.,0
"We had a very comfortable king size bed, a large bathroom with a large supply of bath towels, shampoo, soap, lotion with the hotel name on it.",0
"The pirate theme was carried out in our room also, but it was not dark and dreary, but decorated with bright up to date colors.",1
We had a nice view from the window and could see the volcano next door at the Mirage.,0
The Casino,0
This is the best part of this hotel.,0
"It is large and roomy, with a very helpful staff.",0
"It has all of the normal games such as Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, Caribbean Stud Poker and lots of Slot Machines.",0
I love Keno and this casino has the best Keno Bar on the strip I think.,0
"It is located right off the casino, but is separated from the casino with two half walls, which protect it from so much of the noise of the casino.",0
The chairs here are quite comfortable and the Keno staff is a ton of fun to spend time around.,0
They make the game fun for all and after being there for 2 or 3 days you feel as if you get to know them a little bit.,0
"My husband wasn't quite as impressed with the dealers at the table games, he didn't seem to think they were quite as friendly as some of the other hotels.",1
Food,0
We had breakfast each morning at the cafe located right off the casino.,0
"Since the men were in a meeting, the wives all met for breakfast each day.",0
We had quite a large group and were always quickly seated and waited on.,0
The wait staff were very efficient and always close by if we needed anything.,0
The prices were very reasonable and the food was great.,0
We ate lunch many times at the little deli which had great sandwiches for a very good price.,0
The Pirate Show,0
We had heard many great things about this wonderful show and were anxiously waiting our turn to see it.,0
Unfortunately the winds were to high each night that we were there and we never got to see it live.,1
We did get to see parts of it on Treasure Island TV and were very disappointed that we didn't get to see it for ourselves.,0
"If you go try and see this show, I hear you want be disappointed and I want to read your review and see what you thought.",0
Meeting and Banquet Rooms,0
"I realize that this topic is not often covered in a hotel review, but with us being here for a business meeting I wanted to give you my husband's thought on this.",1
He felt that the meeting rooms were very comfortable and quite clean each day.,0
They were well stocked with snacks and drinks each day for each of his meetings.,0
The rooms were large and they didn't feel packed in like sardines.,1
"We had a banquet on the last night of our stay at Treasure Island and the food, staff and room were all very good.",0
Overall,0
Treasure Island has so much to offer it has to be one of the best on the Las Vegas Strip.,0
We had so much fun here and found everything to be in great shape.,0
Whether you are looking for a place for a business meeting or just a great place for a getaway this is definitely the place for you!,0
Just watch out for those Pirates!,0
Ahoy Mateys!,0
"Several years ago, I decided to take my little brother to Disney World.",0
"As a child, I had never been there, and my parents could nt find it in their budget to take Danny there either.",1
"I told him that when I graduated college, he and I would hop on a plane and spend a week with the Mouse.",0
"Of course, I did nt realize it would cost so much money!",1
"As a recent college graduate, I wanted to cut costs wherever I could.",0
"Furthermore, I wanted to take good care of my then-10-year-old brother, and ultimately, I wanted to stay on property.",0
"After a tremendous deal of research, dozens of travel agent interviews, and about 24 paychecks, I made our reservations at the Wilderness Lodge.",0
This all seemed well and good to me.,0
Wed be on property; wed get early admission into the parks; the cost was reasonable; and wed have a great time.,0
But then I received a letter from the good people at the Disney Corporation.,0
"It seemed they had me in their database of Meeting Planners, and as a result, they wanted to impress me.",0
"I was just starting to get accustomed to this star treatment, which was a perk to my underpaid job.",0
"Without question, I took them up on their offer and called their convention office.",1
"Well hello, Shannon!  they happily greeted me on the phone.",0
 Where would you like to stay? ,0
I could hardly believe it!,0
Anywhere?,0
I could stay anywhere?,0
How about the Grand Floridian?,0
" Well, Shannon, of course you can stay at the Grand Floridian if that s what you really want.",0
But why dont you try The Disney Yacht and Beach Club?  Thats all I needed to hear.,0
"Disneys Yacht and Beach Club is indeed two separate hotels; however, they are one resort ( Does that make sense? ).",0
"The two properties share restaurants, convention services, and a large, spectacular pool.",0
"However, when you make your reservations, you do need to specify whether youd like to be in the Yacht Club or the Beach Club.",0
"Both hotels are magnificent, offering large, beautiful rooms; first-class service; a beautiful view; a lovely beach; and the shortest possible route to Epcot Center.",0
"I place this review under The Beach Club, because that s where I ended up.",0
"My brother and I stayed in a first-floor suite, which had a separate back patio.",0
"The patio looked out over a small, private pool, which got little use during our stay.",0
"The room was large, clean, and carefully decorated.",0
"It offered a full marble bath, two telephones, fax/modem capabilities, concierge services, and a lovely view.",0
"With that said, we did nt plan to spend a heck of a lot of time in our upgraded room.",0
"We were the first to arrive at the parks in the morning, and we were the last to leave at night.",0
"We did, however, make good use of the restaurants, the Beach Club Water Park, the room service, the concierge, and mostly, the location.",0
"Situated right next to Epcot Center, you can walk from the Beach Resort to a back gate into Epcot.",0
The luxury of using the back gate is that you avoid any long lines.,0
"After spending an entire day at this modern theme park, we simply skipped back over to the hotel, where we recharged our batteries for the next day.",0
"The following morning, we caught a van to The Magic Kingdom, where we were granted early admission.",0
"That evening, we attended the Hawaiian Luau.",0
"To get there, we took the van to the Magic Kingdom, then hopped on the Monorail.",0
"Likewise, when we went to MGM, we also took the van.",0
"I should note that the Monorail does not make stops at The Disney Beach and Yacht Club, because it is a little off the beaten path.",1
"However, there was never a lack of alternate transportation, and we never had to wait for these services.",0
The Beach Club Water Park was most definitely a highlight of our trip.,0
"Rather than simply supplying a large pool, this water park offers slides, beaches, games, and a very large play area.",0
"Surprisingly, it was never crowded, and as a result, we skipped Orlandos other water park attractions.",1
"In the end, this saved me a lot of dough.",0
"You see, there is no admission cost to relax at the Beach Club Water Park; it is included in the price of your hotel reservations.",1
"We also took advantage of the property restaurants, which offered a character breakfast as well as an all-you-can-eat dinner buffet.",0
"In classic Disney style, the food was delicious and plentiful; the waiters were undeniably friendly and cordial; and the atmosphere was fun, relaxed, and upscale.",0
"The Beach Club property, in one word, is magnificent.",0
"Since then, I have had the pleasure of staying at just about all the Disney hotels, and this one beats the competition hands-down.",0
Does it compare to the Grand Floridian?,0
You bet!,0
The only thing the Floridian has over this property is a coveted stop on the Monorail track.,0
"Other than that, you will get the same upscale service and a fabulous view.",0
"Likewise, in my opinion, the Beach Club is a bit more laid-back, and it never seems quite as crowded.",1
Staying at the Disney Beach and Yacht Club comes at a price.,0
"This is one of Disneys more expensive properties, as well it should be.",0
"But within walking distance, you can enjoy the new boardwalk; the large, lake-view beach; and an easy stroll to Epcot.",0
"In addition, this is a first-class property, which rivals any Ritz.",0
"When my convention sales associate advised me to stay at the Disney Beach and Yacht Club, she ( in effect ) admitted that this is their proudest accomplishment.",0
"If you have a little extra money and you are seeking an unforgettable trip to Disney World, this is my # 1 suggestion for a place to rest your weary feet.",0
"In conclusion, Danny and I enjoyed a fabulous vacation at Disney World.",0
"Of all the places Ive visited in my lifetime, this was by far my most magical adventure.",0
Disney will never be the same for me as it was that year.,1
"It was my first time, and my little brother is not so little anymore.",1
"Sometimes, now, when I look at his broad shoulders and baby soft facial hair; when I hear his deep, intelligent voice; when I watch him pull out of my moms driveway  I see a tired little boy dressed in mouse ears, waving flags on Main Street, collecting character autographs, and wildly giggling at the top of his ten-year-old lungs.",0
I ache for that vacation all over again ,0
Right next to the Yacht Club at Walt Disney World is the Beach Club Resort.,0
"Although many think the two hotels are identical, they are in fact, very different.",0
"If you read my Yacht Club review, you know that I love staying at that resort.",0
"However, I have also stayed at the Beach Club a few times and have enjoyed my stay here as much as on the other side!",0
Location: The Beach Club resort is right in the middle of EPCOT and MGM Studios.,0
It's actually walking distance to both theme parks.,0
"This can be really convenient because if you go out to the front of the resort where the Disney busses pick you up ( free transportation to anywhere on Disney property ), and it seems crowded, you can either take a left or right ( depending on which park you are heading to ) and take a scenic walk to the gates.",0
"The Beach Club is also within a few minutes of almost all other places on property, including Disney Village, Typhoon Lagoon, Fantasia Golf, and the Boardwalk.",0
"The Rooms: With 583 guest rooms, there are 4 different types of rooms to choose from:",0
#NAME?,0
-Standard View/2 Queens/Kings - view of garden of parking lot.,0
"-Water, Pool View/2 Queens/Kings - view of pool or lake.",0
#NAME?,0
I've stayed in two different rooms at the Beach Club.,0
"One was a standard room with a""view"" of the parking lot.",0
"The second was a suite, which also had a view of the parking lot.",0
"Both rooms were very alike, except that the suite was bigger and had a smaller balcony.",0
Both of the rooms had 2 Queen size beds which were pretty comfortable and a television facing the beds.,0
"There was a futon in the rooms as well, which was nice because we travel with 5 people and that gives the fifth person a place to sleep!",0
A Table and chairs were in the corner of the room.,0
"Next to the closet, there was a dresser and across from the closet is the bathroom area.",0
Two sinks were right outside of the bathroom and the shower and toilet were on the inside.,0
It was funny to find a telephone and television speakers inside of the bathroom too!,0
"But, of course, it was nice to listen to the news while you're taking a shower!",0
"Every morning at the Beach Club, a paper is delivered right outside your door.",0
The Atmosphere: The Beach Club is just beautiful!,0
"On both sides of the lobby, there are cushioned seats around beautiful flowers.",0
"If you feel like relaxing indoors, you can sit down in one of the comfortable chairs or couches in the lobby.",0
"When you go outside, you will find rocking chairs and some beautiful topiary pieces.",0
"The last time I was there, there was a huge butterfly as soon as you walk out of the lobby.",0
"Just across the Boardwalk is the beach and the lagoon, where you can sit on a swing and enjoy the beautiful day.",0
"The Pool: Known as the most popular pool on Disney property, The Beach Club's pool is just GREAT!",0
"The pool is shared with the Yacht Club, which is adjacent to the Beach Club.",0
There are actually 3 different pools in this area and they are all different so everyone can enjoy them!.,0
The first pool that you see when you walk out of the Beach is Stormalong Bay.,0
A huge water slide emties into the pool whose entrance is right across the Boardwalk.,0
But Stormalong Bay doesn't only have a water slide!,0
"It also has a whirlpool,""quicksand"" and one spot where you can swim into a huge pool of bubbles.",0
"If you cross over to the next pool, you will feel the current pull you along.",0
This is a lazy river pool.,0
"The next pool is a children's pool, where the water is shallow and the kids can build sandcastle's on the sandy beach area.",0
These pools are so different from all the other pools on property because there is sand on the bottom of them!,0
Hot tubs are located in the middle of Beaches and Cream and Stormalong bay.,0
"There are a couple quiet pools that you can also go to, which are open really late at night.",0
"The Food: Whether you're looking for a quick snack or a sit-down dinner, the Beach Club has it all.",0
"Out by the pool is Hurricane Hanna's where you can get alcoholic beverages, hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken fingers and cookies.",0
Poolside beverage service is available all day from Hurricane Hanna's.,0
Beaches and Cream Soda Shop is just a couple minutes away.,0
This restaurant is great because it looks like an old soda fountain shop.,0
"Here, they offer meals, like turkey club sandwiches or hamburgers or you can just order some ice cream to go.",0
"If you are looking for a full-service restaurant, then you should try the Cape May Caf.",0
"Every morning, the buffet restaurant has a Character breakfast with Goofy, Chip and Dale, and Minnie Mouse.",0
"Every night, an indoor clambake buffet offers clams, mussels, beef-ribs, chicken and some great desserts!",0
Marthas Vineyard is located inside and has a different selections from different vineyards.,0
"The Rip Tide is a lobby lounge that has wines, wine coolers, beers, cocktails, and frozen drinks.",0
"The only thing I don't like about the Beach Club's food is that there isn't a food court, not even a small 24 hour court that offers snacks.",1
Other restaurants can be found just a few minutes away at the Yacht Club or right even on the Boardwalk.,0
Beaches and Cream and Hurricane Hanna's are only open for so long...,0
The Service: There are many different services that are offered at the Beach Club.,0
"Whether you need customer service or Valet parking, someone is always there to help you.",0
Everyone always has a smile on their face.,0
"There is even a"" Greeter"" who is dressed as a ship's captain who says good morning and/or welcome to you every time you leave and come back!",0
"Some of the other services that they have are kid's programs at the Sandcastle Club, an Arcade, A health club and a barber/hairdresser salon.",0
"There are facilities right at your fingertips where you can rent boats, play tennis, volleyball or even croquet.",0
The Beach Club is also perfect for business conventions.,0
"Sharing a huge facility with the Yacht Club, the two resorts have a 73,000 square foot function area that also has a 36,000 square foot Ballroom and 21 breakout rooms.",0
The Beach Club definitely has a lot to offer!,0
"Every time I stay there, I have a lot of fun and I bet you will too!",0
I have been to Disney World several times.,0
One year I stayed at Disney's Yacht and Beach Club.,0
The outside of the hotel is extraordinary.,0
It is surrounded by a beautiful beach.,0
Too bad they don't let you swim in the water though.,1
Something about catching a disease........,0
The signs don't stop the ducks from swimming in the water though.,1
They even have quarter machines for you to purchase food for the ducks (yet another way for Mickey Mouse to make money ),0
All of the Disney resorts have great pools.,0
The Yacht and Beach Club has the nicest pool of them all.,0
"The pool, which goes on forever, has 2 sections.",0
"Part of the pool is deep, while the other part, which is good for children, is shallow.",0
In the middle of the shallow part is an oasis of sand where the children can build sand castles.,0
This pool is the home of one of the scariest water slides I have ever seen.,0
I have never gone on it because I am scared of water slides.,1
It looks like a lot of fun though.,0
I love to eat.,0
This hotel has many eating options.,0
"When you're tanning by the pool, you can eat at Hurricane Hannah's.",0
Don't want to get up to get your food?,0
No problem!,1
You can ask one of the waitresses who walks around the pool to get you your food.,0
"They have the best burgers, curly fries, and salads.",0
They also serve great daiquiri's.,0
"In the mood for a cold, refreshing drink?",0
Make a stop at Beaches and Cream.,0
These drinks are very refreshing after a hard day at the pool.,0
Dinner time?,0
"Well, you MUST eat at Cate May Cafe which is part of the Yacht and Beach Club hotel.",0
It is a buffet dinner.,0
"They have shrimp, ribs, chicken, steamers, muscles, crab legs, and many other items.",0
The desserts are incredible!,0
"I usually don't like the desserts that they have at buffets, but this place isn't like all of the others!",1
"This hotel is very expensive to stay at, but well worth it.",0
"Whenever a T.V. family goes to Disney World, they almost always stay at the Yacht and Beach Club.",0
It's no wonde,1
"Disney's Beach Club resort is truly beautiful, relaxing, and perfectly situated.",0
"It's connected to the Yacht Club resort, which has a New England sailing theme; the Beach Club is themed more like a seaside retreat, decorated in pale, refreshing""beachy"" colors.",0
"The pool, called Stormalong Bay ( shared by both resorts ) is the Beach Club's jewel, the element that keeps families coming back: it's huge, with lots of nooks and crannies and bridges, a sand-covered bottom instead of typical concrete, and a big water slide.",0
"There are stands set up along the""beach"" where you can have your hair beaded and braided and buy seashell jewelry.",0
Water sprites and small speed boats are available for rental.,0
You could spend days hanging around these sister resorts and never run out of things to do!,1
Dining,0
"Directly across from the Yacht and Beach Club is the Boardwalk resort, which is just a 5-minute walk away, and there are tons of dining and entertainment options over there ( the Boardwalk looks beautiful all lit up at night, if you've got a lagoon view room ).",0
"The dining choices at the Yacht and Beach Club aren't shabby, either: Cape May Cafe offers a character buffet breakfast in the morning and a non-character ( but delicious ) clambake buffet at night, with menu items such as clam chowder, fresh clams, corn on the cob, new potatoes, chicken, rice, salad bar, and the most scrumptious dessert bar in WDW ( not to mention a kid's section with fried shrimp, chicken tenders, etc. ).",1
"Hurricane Hannah's is a snack bar by the pool where you can find burgers, tuna sandwiches, etc. and drinks ( alcoholic and non ) to eat on the patio or take back to your poolside chair.",0
"Over at the Yacht Club, you might want to have one of the best steaks of your life at the Yachtsman's Steakhouse; and be absolutely sure to stop in at Beaches and Cream, the fifties-style soda fountain that has the best cheeseburgers and fries in all of WDW, plus hard ice cream and all sorts of ice cream concoctions ( I love the chocolate malteds and brownie sundaes--yum!",0
Stop here even if you're not staying at this resort--you'll thank me later!! ).,1
A full 24-hour room service menu is available.,0
Accommodations,0
"Guest rooms are spacious and comfortable: two queen-sized beds, large bathroom with two outside sinks, a table with two chairs, a couch that serves as a bed, TV, and mini-bar in every room.",0
Housekeeping does a great job of keeping your room beautiful.,0
"Most rooms have balconies, but some upper-floor rooms only have tiny balconies which can barely hold 2 people standing upright--if you want a full balcony with chairs, you should definitely request one when you're making reservations, and then again ( by fax or phone ) a few days before you check in.",0
"If you would like a little more space for your money, you might want to request a Hammerhead ( corner ) room, which is more spacious and spread out.",0
"My only Beach Club room complaint is that there is very little storage space for clothes--only a few large drawers, a standing chest of small drawers, and not very much closet space/hangers.",1
Transportation,0
"Transportation is pretty darned good at this non-monorail resort: 10-minute boat launch to Disney Studios, bus service to the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom, and you can take a scenic walk to EPCOT Center ( entering through the World Showcase...only a 5-minute walk, if that.",0
Bonus: you can see France from certain spots at the resort!,0
; ) ) You can also take a boat launch to EPCOT.,0
"One more note: if you happen to have your own car or a rental car on property, it makes much more sense, sometimes, to drive to a monorail resort ( Grand Floridian, Contemporary, Polynesian ), park there, and take the monorail to the Magic Kingdom.",0
"Likewise for the Animal Kingdom--park at the new Animal Kingdom Lodge, or simply drive to the park itself to save a LOT of time that might be spent on an uncomfortable bus.",0
"Overall, Disney's Beach Club knows how to make a good time for the whole family--anyone staying at the Yacht and Beach Club has so many options just a few steps away.",0
"I highly recommend this resort; I know you will, too!",0
"On our last visit to Disney World, we did something called""resort-hopping"" where you split your stay between two or more resorts.",0
The second half of our stay was at the Wilderness Lodge.,0
This resort is in the lower price range of the deluxe resorts at Disney World.,0
We received an annual pass rate of $ 579 for 3 nights.,0
"Since this was the last time we'd be staying at Disney with only 2 kids and most of the rooms have a maximum occupancy of 4, we thought we'd better give it a shot now.",0
Walking into the lobby I was amazed.,0
There are totem poles and a giant stone fireplace.,0
"Two restaurants are present just off the lobby, Whispering Canyon and Artist Point.",0
"Artist Point offers a Winnie-the-Pooh character breakfast, while there's good fun to be had at Whispering Canyon ( just ask for ketchup and see what happens ).",0
There is also a cafeteria-style restaurant where you can purchase a refillable mug and get free beverages for the rest of your trip.,0
"During our trip there was a lot of construction going on in this area, so I don't know if we got a fair sampling of the food, but it seemed to be somewhat lacking.",1
The rooms themselves are mainly in two wings.,0
We asked for and received a room on the 5th floor overlooking the Magic Kingdom.,0
The plus was having a view of the Castle and viewing the fireworks at night through the trees.,0
The minus is that this overlooks the smokehouse for the restaurant and a delivery area.,0
"Some people have said they found it noisy, but we didn't notice any outside noise.",0
"The 5th floor balconies have a railing, while the 6th floor has decorative boards, making it harder for little ones to get a view and tempting them to climb up to get one.",0
The room was nicely decorated and clean.,0
The double sink is outside of the bathroom and has plenty of counter space.,0
There was also quite a bit of closet space.,0
"One of the amenities the deluxe resorts have over moderates is a full room service instead of pizza delivery, Though we never used it, the menu was very tempting and would've been nice for a late-night snack after a day of touring the parks.",1
"Another amenity is the"" Cubs Den"" where your children can go for fun at night while the parents get a night out to themselves.",0
"We don't like to leave our kids on vacation, but I have heard from a lot of people that their kids look forward to spending this time away from Mom and Dad.",0
But what we loved best about the Wilderness Lodge was the pool area.,0
"Water runs out of the lobby and down through a waterfall and a""brook"" into the pool.",0
There is a slide that my 9 year old couldn't get enough of.,0
"Even in the cool early March nights, the two of them would ask to go to the pool after a day in the parks.",0
There is also a wading pool for little swimmers and two hot tubs.,0
"In keeping with the Northwest theme, a geyser goes off every hour.",0
All of this area offers a clear view of Bay Lake.,0
"Our daughters had their hair""wrapped"" poolside at a cost of about $ 60 for the two of them.",0
"If you can get out of doing this, it's a good idea.",0
We started the tradition one year and now they look forward to it.,0
The Magic Kingdom is just a short boat ride away from Wilderness Lodge.,0
"There is also a marina, and you can watch the water pageant on the beach every night.",0
This resort is so interesting that Disney offers tours.,0
Inquire at guest services if you are interested.,0
This is one of the resorts I would love to stay at again if I had the money cause we enjoyed it so much.,0
Just spent the weekend at the Golden Nugget.,0
"I was really a bit frightened that it would be, well, stinky.",0
I have been in the downtown Fremont area before (usually late night taxi rides from the Strip )... but had never stayed at any of the hotels there.,1
I was quite pleasantly surprised!,0
It was absolutely gorgeous.,0
"The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly, the rooms were nicely sized and very affordable.",0
"Our biggest bonus ( and still not sure why this happened ), was upon check-in the gal informed us we had a $ 50 credit to be used anywhere in the hotel.",0
"I have no idea why, it may have been because we booked the rooms through www.tripreservations.com,",1
but anyway - we did not argue.,1
"This was a great treat because it allowed us room service twice, tip included!",0
"I must say the room service food was excellent, top notch, with prompt delivery.",0
We also ate at the Carson Street cafe and the food there was very good.,0
"The only thing that might scare someone off, especially someone new to Vegas who might not know what to expect - is that the hotels and streets surrounding the Nugget can be a bit seedy.",1
"You might see a few more drunks, street vagrants and hookers than you would see at say, Caesar's Palace!",0
"They certainly have cleaned it up well with the Fremont Street Experience, a giant dome was built over the street that has a light show every night.",0
"This has drawn a few more family types down to the area, but while you may be watching the light show with your wife - you just might get cat-called by one of the strippers canvasing the crowd in front of Glitter Gulch.",0
"I will also say, steer clear of"" Mermaids"" a small, stinky, machine only mini casino with the cheapest liquor in tiny cups ( they do not pour anything but flat tap beer and disgusting well liquor ) and some of the scariest Coney Dogs with faux nacho cheese sauce I have ever seen.",1
"It used to be a tostada bar, not bad then.",1
"This place is a design nightmare, if you do go ( maybe you like design nightmares ) check out the costumes on the mermaid/Carmen Miranda girls.",0
What are they?,0
"Not too far of a walk to the Golden Gate Hotel, established in 1906, with 99-cent shrimp cocktails that rock!",1
"You will have to stand in a bit of a line, with mostly cranky people, but 99 cent shrimp cocktails are okay by me!",0
All in all we had a really great stay at the Golden Nugget.,0
I would definitely stay there again,0
Review Topic: Overview,0
"Clearly the jewel of Downtown Las Vegas, The Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino has not lost its luster since Steve Wynn sold it over a year ago.",1
"The Nugget is a five star hotel/resort in every aspect, and is a bargain, to boot.",0
"I've stayed at the Golden Nugget a score of times over the past two decades, and it just keeps getting better and better.",0
Accomodations,0
Rooms at the Golden Nugget are spacious and luxurious.,0
"Currently decorated in neutral colors and a with a French Provincial decor, each room has a large credenza housing a TV, a table and two side chairs, and bedside tables with clock radio and phone/message service, and a dressing/makeup table complete with magnifying mirror.",0
"Lighting is adequate, and the air conditioning heating system is powerful, though noisy, with individual room controls.",0
"Beds are very comfortable, with soft linens, soft pillows and as an extra luxury, a sheet both over and under the blanket.",0
"The bathroom is very large, with marble floor, large Corian counter with sink, very large and fluffy towels and a REAL bath mat in place of the usual towel mat.",0
I've never had a less than perfectly clean and fully operational room at the Nugget.,1
"It's a quiet, relaxing place to stay.",0
Hotel/Resort Ambience,0
"The Golden Nugget, though it lacks the theme-orientation and hugeness of many of the newer strip hotels, is a quality resort in every aspect.",0
"The hotel lobby is white marble, graced by huge, fresh flower arrangements and a mural-sized original oil painting by LeRoy Neiman.",0
"The decor is rather generic but pleasing, with red/black carpeting, pure white walls and lots of beautifully maintained polished brass accents.",0
"The pool has a large and fully equipped spa and exercise facility, a beautiful outdoor pool area, and, of course, a vast casino.",0
"Its Carson Street cafe serves excellent"" coffee shop"" food, their buffet is excellent and reasonably priced, and there are three specialty restaurants: California Pizza Kitchen, Stephano's ( Italian ) and Lily Langtry's ( Mandarin Chinese ).",0
Both gift shops feature boutique clothing for men and women as well as the usual novelty gifts and snacks.,0
There are no other shops at the Nugget.,1
One of the main draws of the Nugget is that it is an ADULT environment.,0
"Because there are no attractions for children, you won't find them wandering through the casino or hotel hallways.",1
Casino,0
The casino is large and very well lighted.,0
"Table minimums are usually $ 5, though an occasional $ 3 blackjack table can be found on weekday afternoons.",0
All blackjack is dealt out of the shoe.,0
"Pai gow poker, Caribbean stud, roulette, craps, and baccarat are offered, and there is a special area for""high stakes"" players.",0
"As with most casinos these days, slot machines and video poker machines dominate the casino layout, though they are overly noisy or obtrusive.",0
Cocktail waitresses circulate frequently offering free beverages.,0
"Casino employees are friendly and helpful, for the most part.",0
"It's a pleasant place to gamble, though I usually go elsewhere, since single-deck blackjack favors the player.",0
Conclusions,0
Perhaps the greatest incentives in staying at the Nugget ( besides its adult atmosphere ) are its proximity to several other casinos downtown and its outstanding quality for money spent.,0
"Rates are modest by Vegas standards, given the luxury of this resort.",0
"Once you stay at the Golden Nugget several times, you are invited to join their"" Private Arrangement"" club, where discounts and freebies are offered to frequent guests.",0
"In August I stayed at the Nugget midweek for $ 39/night, with a $ 25 certificate for food in any of the hotel's restaurants.",0
"Other privileges include a""go to the head of the line"" card, where one can avoid long lines at the buffet and coffee shop, and a free night for every four nights accrued.",0
It's tough to pass up a good deal like this.,0
"The Golden Nugget has been a mainstay of Las Vegas, and even by current Strip standards, is a prime place to stay and play.",0
"The new owners are committed to retain the high standards set by Steve Wynn, and are constantly upgrading and remodelling to remain competitive.",0
It's a jewel that is worth many times its modest price.,0
The Golden Nugget is the best hotel in downtown Las Vegas by far!,0
If you go during the week you can get fantastic rates.,0
My husband travels to Vegas weekly for business so he stays there at least 2 nights a week.,0
"The rooms are luxurious, elegant and very clean, with beautiful decor.",0
"The bathrooms are nice, roomy, pretty and clean.",0
"They always have shampoo, conditioner, lotion and mouthwash.",0
"They have a non-smoking floor, but I have on occasion stayed in non-smoking rooms there that stink like smoke.",0
When this has happened I call housekeeping and they come right up and deoderize the room for me.,0
It helps a little.,0
What are you gonna do?,0
It's Las Vegas.,0
The pool is very nice with plenty of chaises in the shade and a misting system.,0
They also have cabanas that can be reserved for $ 50.00 a day.,0
It's a luxury but worth it.,0
"We rented one for the day when the kids were with us, and the little one said she felt like a""rich lady.""",0
She can hope.,0
"In the cabana there is a t.v., refrigerator stocked with fruit platter and bottled water, patio table and 4 chairs, 2 pool mattresses, and 2 reserved chaises with towels.",0
"It was very nice, and the cabana attendant assigned to us was very attentive and helpful.",0
We even ordered lunch out there.,0
There was also a misting system in the cabana.,0
The casino is nice too.,0
"It's rather small by some hotel's standards, but it's very beautiful and I never had trouble finding a seat for black jack!",1
"There are several restaurants; California Pizza Kitchen ( I highly recommend it ), Lilly Langtrys which is a chinese/steak type restaurant and is on the pricier side ( haven't been there, but have seen the menu ), The Buffet is decent, but there's almost always a huge line - Golden Nugget is famous for their bread pudding (ick ), which I don't like but other people rave about and the prices are reasonable.",0
"The Coffee Shop ( can't remember the name ) is very good, usually not too bad a wait if you go at off hours.",1
They have the best french toast I have ever eaten - The Nugget French Toast.,0
"It's Hawaiian Sweet Bread covered with bananas and pecans, my mouth is watering!",0
"Also, one thing I love about Fremont Street ( where the Nugget is located ) is that everything is in close proximity.",0
"So you can go walk from hotel to hotel, without dying of heat prostration.",1
I like to gamble at the Golden Gate ( when I'm feeling cheap ) because they have $ 3 tables.,0
"Also, the laser show on Fremont Street is really incredible - they have it every evening after dark.",0
"There are little kiosks with gifts, etc... up and down the street too.",0
"However, I would recommend not walking outside of Fremont Street as the surrounding areas are a little scary.",1
"I would definitely recommend the Golden Nugget ( oh, and did I mention free parking for hotel guests? ) it's beautifully appointed, luxurious and if you hit it just right, cheap.",0
My wife and I just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at the Polynesian Resort at Walt Disney World Florida.,0
We had spent part of our honeymoon there in 1975 and we both wanted to go back when we could afford it.,0
It ended up taking 25 years ( and Epinions ) to complete our dream.,0
"With all the family expenses, including a daughter in college, it became impossible to save enough to make reservations to stay there.",0
"In November of 1999 I was introduced to Epinions and thus, after writing and reading many hours, we were able to afford to make reservations and thus our 25th anniversary dream came true.",0
Thanks to all who read my articles and helped make this milestone in our lives come true.,0
A Brief Description,0
Theres so much I can write about this outstanding Resort in central Florida.,0
We arrived on Monday morning and checked in to our room.,0
In the Polynesian Resort there are many Long Houses  where they have 3 floors of rooms in each.,0
"The buildings are named Tonga, Aotearoa, Fiji, Tuvalu, Samoa, Niue, Hawaii, Tokelau, Rapa Nui, and Rarotonga.",0
Then there is the Great Ceremonial House.,0
Here is housed the registration desk and numerous restaurants and shops.,0
"It is a two-floor building with a waterfall in the center, which is surrounded with tropical plants and flowers.",0
This wondrous tableau is two stories tall and completely takes up the center of the building.,0
On both floors are many shops and dining places for all tastes and prices.,0
In the center of all the building is a very nice swimming pool with a poolside bar.,0
There is a guest laundry room and a video game room for the kids.,0
On the second floor in the Monorail which services the Magic Kingdom and Epcot.,0
Our Building,0
We stayed in the Hawaii building which is a Concierge Service building.,0
Included as part of this service is a 2nd floor room where we could go and have a variety of foods during each day.,0
From 7:00 a.m.,0
"till 10:30 a.m. they provide fresh fruits, juices, danish, cereals, teas, and fresh brewed coffee and is called Kakahiaka ( morning service ).",0
"From 12:00 p.m. till 4:00 p.m. we could have Guava juice, lemonade, and tea as well as various types of cookies and this is called Auinala ( afternoon service ).",0
"From 5:00 p.m. till 7:00 p.m. we would have available a selection of wines, light hors doeuvres, and soda and fruit juices and this is called Ahiahi ( evening service ).",0
And finally from 8:00 p.m. till 10:00 p.m. visitors can have a sampling of fantastic desserts and a wide choice of cordials.,0
"You were encouraged to take soda, water and snacks back to your room for later consumption.",0
All this was at no extra charge.,1
There was also expert staff in the building from 7:00 a.m.,0
till 10:00 p.m. each day to assist you with any problem that may arise or to assist in making reservations for dining or special events.,0
Dining,0
In the Polynesian Resort there are several places to dine.,0
The biggest and most elaborate is the nightly Luau held in Luau Cove.,0
"This is a family style meal with pork and chicken served with fruits, vegetables and bread.",0
For dessert is pineapple cake.,0
"During the meal is a Polynesian theme floorshow, complete with male and female dancers in traditional costume.",0
They include the audience in the action especially the children by teaching them to do the hula.,0
They also have a fire dancer who is the grant finale.,0
Reservations several weeks in advance of your arrival is necessary.,0
In the Great Ceremonial House there is the Ohana Feast which is an all you can eat meal.,0
When entering you are guided to your table and taught the customs of the islands.,0
We are considered Cousins  and treated like family.,0
"The meal consisted of pork dumplings, spring rolls, smoked salmon, noodles, steamed vegetables, grilled pork, turkey, top sirloin, and jumbo shrimp.",0
Dessert is sliced fresh pineapple and caramel sauce.,0
The meal is $ 20.99 all you can eat and frankly the food was better here than at the Luau.,0
Its easy to get a seat early but for evening dining reservations are recommended.,0
Also in the building is Tambu Lounge featuring exotic libations.,0
Appetizers are available from 5:00 p.m. till 10:00 p.m. daily.,0
The Kona Caf is an excellent place for a morning eye opener or a family breakfast like Tonga Toast.,0
They even serve lunch.,0
Overall,0
As I mentioned earlier we were there 25 years ago and liked it so much we went back for our 25th anniversary.,0
If everything goes well well go back again for another occasion.,0
I only hope that this time it will not be 25 more years.,1
Its a great place for the entire family.,0
Everyone is treated like they are the most important people there by all the staff.,0
You are greeted with Aloha!  by all the staff.,0
Every question is answered in a quick and efficient manner.,0
If you want reservations to a show or dinner they make you feel like they really want to make them for you.,0
"Of all the places Ive stayed over the years, Disneys Polynesian Resort is the best!!!!!!!",0
I have recently returned from my honeymoon.,0
My husband and I chose Disney World for several reasons.,0
"To begin with, I grew up in California, so my family always went to Disney Land.",0
"However, we had cable television and I remember watching a special on all the different theme hotels at Disney World and wishing I could stay at all the different hotels.",0
"I had stayed with my family at the Disneyland hotel many times, but that hotel does not have a theme.",1
"Our first choice was the Grand Floridian, but since we were paying for the honeymoon ourselves, we opted not to stay there after learning that our honeymoon would cost about $ 500 more than it would if we stayed at the Polynesian.",1
"The"" Poly"" was our second choice.",0
We chose to stay there because it had a Hawaiian/Polynesian theme that would be ( hopefully ) similar to going to Hawaii for a honeymoon.,0
"Well, not exactlybut you know what I mean.",1
The Poly is very ideally situated.,0
"It is on the monorail line, so getting to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot are very easy.",0
"It is also within walking distance of the Ticket and Transportation Center, which provides bus transportation to MGM Studios, Animal Kingdom, Downtown Disney and the water parks.",0
"Additionally, bus transportation is also provided directly from the hotel.",0
"Staying at the Poly makes it very easy to get around the"" World.""",0
The rooms at the Poly are quite large.,0
Rooms are located in one of about five or six 2-3 story buildings.,0
"A standard room comes with two queen beds and a day bed, so two parents and three children can stay quite comfortably.",0
I think you can fit in a baby in a crib in addition to the five people already staying there.,0
The armoire has 5 drawers or so with plenty of space for clothes.,0
"Additionally, there is a large closet with a room safe for storing valuables.",0
"There is also a table, two chairs and an ice bucket.",0
The room dcor is very festive.,0
Island patterned bedspreads about and the aforementioned armoire had a faux bamboo design as did the headboard.,0
"While it was more kitschy than authentic, it was still a fun place to stay.",0
There are several types of rooms.,0
"The least expensive is the""garden"" room and there are also""lagoon"" rooms ( with views of the water ) and concierge rooms with lots of extra pampering.",0
"We had a garden room-next to the monorail, no less.",1
"However, even though the monorail passed right by our patio door, it was so quiet that it did not bother us at all.",1
The Great Ceremonial house is the main building at the Poly.,0
It includes clothing stores for men and women.,0
We got caught in a HUGE rainstorm on Wednesday and Steve's shorts were soaked.,0
"We thought about buying another pair for him, but the shorts on sale were around $ 40-and they were ugly!",0
One of our favorite places was the snack bar.,0
You can buy a mug there for $ 10 and then get free refills for the duration of your stay.,0
"Considering that a soda costs about $ 1.50, this is a great cost saver-especially if you come back to the hotel for a rest in the middle of the afternoon.",0
"Additional dining options include the Kona Caf and Ohanas, which we ate at on our first night.",0
"I plan to review the restaurant in a different section, but I assure you, this is a must see-even if you don't stay at the Poly.",1
"In short, it is an all-you can eat feast featuring meat on sticks.",0
The cost is $ 22 per person and well worth it.,0
It's a great place to take kids-we loved our meal there.,0
"In the morning, Ohanas features a character breakfast.",0
"There is also a luau show presented two or three times a night for several nights a week, but we did not see it.",1
"The Poly features a""quiet"" pool and the more popular"" Volcano"" pool with a water slide and"" smoking"" volcano.",0
"Since we went in August and it was very hot just about every day, the pools were crowded.",0
"The waterslide was fun, but ruffian children going down face first made it a little less fun.",0
"Although we did not do this, the Poly also rents little speedboats for about $ 25 for a  hour.",1
"They looked like a lot of fun, but we did not have time to do this.",1
I did have a couple of very minor problems about the room.,0
"First, the shower pressure was very low.",0
"I don't know if this was a Florida drought thing or something else, but it was annoying.",1
"Also, our remote control had no batteries, but since we did not spend so much time watching television, this did not bother us either.",1
"The pillows were smaller than normal and a little hard, but that was the only thing that bothered me.",0
"As you can see, these things are minor.",0
"Also, when we arrived, Steve asked about an room upgrade because it was our honeymoon.",0
"The clerk said that there were no rooms available, but he would be happy to send something for us over the next day.",0
We never got anything.,1
"Again, since we were going to be getting something for nothing, not getting it didn't bother me, but still.",1
"Overall, staying at the Poly was great.",0
We ate a meal at the Yacht Club resort and we found it somewhat inconvenient to take a crowded bus to and from the Magic Kingdom after our own experiences of simply taking the monorail to the Magic Kingdom.,0
"In my opinion, it is worth the money to be so close to the theme parks.",0
"The Poly is a great place for everyone-honeymooners, couples, families, singles-everyone can appreciate the dcor and everything the Poly has to offer.",0
I've been to Walt Disney World about nine times since 1985 and stayed at the Polynesian Beach Resort most of those times.,0
The first time was an accident ( it was all that was available ) but each time afterward it was a conscious decision.,0
"I've talked to numerous people at the resort who told me that, they too were repeat visitors.",0
"That in itself might be sufficient endorsement, but I'll elaborate:-)",0
Location,0
"In real estate, they say that location is everything.",0
"If that's the case, you can't go wrong here if your main interest at WDW is the Magic Kingdom.",1
"Like the Contemporary, Grand Floridian and Wilderness Lodge, the Polynesian is located across the water from the MK.",0
"Unlike the others, though, you have four options for getting there from the Poly.",0
"You can take the monorail from the station within the resort ( about five minutes, depending on timing ); take the boat from the Poly marina dock ( about ten minutes, longer if the circular route takes you to the Grand Floridian first ); or walk over to the Ticket and Transportation Center and take the ferryboat or direct monorail.",0
"The last two options may not sound too appealing, but if you're on the west side of the resort, the walk is less than ten minutes and if there is a big line at the Poly, you might save some time.",1
"More importantly, here's something few people don't realize -- by walking to the TTC, you can get on a direct monorail to EPCOT and save yourself the trip around the lagoon on the resort monorail.",0
This makes the Polynesian the only resort with direct monorail access to two theme parks.,0
All over locations within Walt Disney World are accessed by Disney bus ( or your car ).,0
Rooms,0
The standard room at the Polynesian is very large.,0
There are two Queen sized beds and a day bed -- enough space for five adults.,0
The bathroom is fairly sizable.,0
"The South Seas theming is carried into the rooms with canopies over the beds, cane furniture and appropriate coloured wallpaper and paint.",0
One complaint that I have about the rooms is that there aren't enough power outlets.,0
"I bring a computer, camcorder and cellular phone on trips and have a hard time plugging everything in without putting something in the bathroom ( not a good idea ).",1
You can connect to AOL with a local call ( 0.75 charge per call ).,0
"The rooms are spread around the resort in various""longhouses"" ( traditional Polynesian structures ) that are three stories high.",0
Some of the older buildings do not have balconies on the second floor.,1
"If getting a balcony ( first floor rooms all have patios ) is important to you, be sure to call the resort a couple of days before you arrive to request it.",0
"Because of the layout of the resort, some buildings are lengthy hikes away from the main building.",0
"My personal favourites are Samoa and Fiji, both of which are near the main building.",0
"If you want to be further away ( and quieter ), the Tahiti is on the far end of the resort ( and has a short walk to the TTC. )",0
All of the rooms have recently been refurbished.,0
Food Service,0
There are two full service restaurants at the hotel and a 24 hour snack bar.,0
O'Hana,0
"O'Hana, which means""family"", serves two meals.",0
"There is a character breakfast with ( last time I was there ) Minnie, Goofy and Chip and Dale.",0
"The food is all you can eat, family style and is no better or worse than you'd find at the local Perkins.",1
"There is also an evening meal (""feast"" ) that consists of appetizers, a salad, all the""skewer served roasted meat"" you can handle, and a pineapple and caramel desert.",0
"I'm of the opinion that the evening meal has declined over the years and, while I used to love it, I now generally skip it.",0
"On nights when there are fireworks over the Magic Kingdom, they dim the lights and pipe in the music so that you can enjoy it from the huge windows that overlook the lagoon and MK.",0
Kona Cafe,0
"This replaced the Coral Island Cafe, which was awful.",0
"I've only eaten here a couple of times and the food, island in nature, is much better, but very overpriced.",0
"Not too bad for lunch, but don't go there if you are in a hurry.",1
Captain Cooks,0
This is a snack bar on the lower level of the main building.,0
"It's open 24 hours ( and occasionally puts out 1/2 price pastries after 1am:-) and serves some hot food ( burgers, chicken sandwiches and hot dogs ) along with pastries and ice creams.",0
"The first night you are there, buy a refillable mug.",0
"You can go back to the snack bar for the duration of your stay and refill it with soda, lemonade and coffee for free.",0
Nothing at Captain Cooks is overly bad or overly good.,0
It's just convenient.,0
Amenities,0
There is plenty to do at the resort that has nothing to do with the theme parks.,0
"You can rent paddle or mini speed boats, and sail boats (you apparently need some sort of proof that you know how to sail to get on those ) to check out the Seven Seas Lagoon and Bay Lake.",0
There are several white sand beachs with chairs and umbrellas.,0
Swimming in the Lagoon is not encouraged.,1
There are two pools.,0
"One is currently ( 2/01 ) closed for renovation, and is a themed pool (eg: lots of kids ).",0
"The other is a""quiet pool"" and is just a big round thing.",0
Both pools are heated and may be swum in during the coldest weather.,0
Once or twice the pools have been closed in the evening due to mosquito problems.,0
"Otherwise, they are open all night, but only supervised with lifeguards until about 10pm.",0
"If you go to the Great Ceremonial House ( main building ) during the day, there are often activities for children, including Disney movies, colouring and singing and dancing.",0
"Also within the main building there are several stores, offering clothing ( pretty pricey, ) tropical items and sundries.",0
There is a pub and small liquor off sale in the main building as well.,0
Suggestions,0
Book a garden view room and ask when you check in if they have any upgrades available.,0
I've been bumped up a couple of times.,0
Rent a car.,0
"The bus system, while efficient, will never get you where you need to go as fast as driving yourself.",1
Don't forget the short walk to the TTC if you want to go to EPCOT.,0
It will save you a ton of time.,0
You can take the resort monorail back to the Polynesian on your return -- it's the first stop.,0
"For a quiet evening, grab a couple of drinks and go down to the beach about 9pm to watch the Electrical Water Pageant, an underpublicized and enjoyable event.",0
Drop your kids off at the Neverland Club ( located within the resort ) and spend an evening at Pleasure Island.,0
"The Neverland Club, like Ohana, has deteriorated a bit over the years, but is still fun for little kids.",0
"This is an expensive resort, no doubt about that.",1
"Going during the off season and joining the Disney Club will result in some reductions, but it's still not a place to go if you're on a tight budget.",1
"To start off my review, let me put it quite simply:",0
WILDERNESS LODGE IS A FABULOUS PLACE TO STAY AT ON YOUR DISNEY WORLD VACATION.,0
"Now, to expound on that a bit more....",0
"***RESORT LOBBY, RESTAURANTS, and AMENITIES***",0
My family and I vacationed in WDW last in Sept. 2001 and had the opportunity to stay for the week in this gorgeously themed and decorated resort and were highly impressed.,0
"The"" Disney magic"" is abundantly felt and seen in this huge log cabin of a resort, a resort made up in the style of old American Northwest Woods cabin.",0
"If you're not already in awe at the sight of this impressive building, you're really in for a treat once you walk through the front doors into the enormous, open lobby.",1
"It really will take your breath away as within the lobby is a huge multi-colored stone fireplace, a huge wooden totem pole made of various animal carvings, and hanging from the ceiling as lights are large Native American tents with various hunting depictions on them.",0
"In the background, playing fairly lightly are tunes from various western films such as Dances With Wolves, which if you've heard the songs from it, are beautiful and tranquil to listen to.",0
"Off to the right as you walk into the building is the Service Desk, where resort employees are available at all times to offer prompt and courteous service.",0
"I have to give credit to the help, since we made use of them several times and they never came off as being bothered by your questions and were genuinely interested in helping you.",1
"That may be a pretty small thing for some people, but that small thing adds to the overall charm and appeal of WL.",0
Within the main lobby are several small sitting places with comfortable chairs and sofas.,0
We took advantage of these numerous times so we could all play cards.,0
"It was convenient, and we managed to be friendly with the other guests who usually stopped by out of curiosity to see what we were doing.",0
"To the left and going down the ramp are the resorts main eating establishments, Artist Point ( the fancier, more expensive dinner-only restaurant which serves American cuisine and requires you to make advance reservations ), Whispering Canyon Cafe ( the more moderately priced family restaurant serving all three meals and occasionally has a visit by a Disney character during breakfast ), and The Roaring Forks snack bar ( a quick and easy counter-service area that serves up light snacks and meal items any time of the day ).",0
"If you don't make the turn down to the Roaring Forks and continue outside, you're in the pool area of the resort.",1
"The main pool is heated, but on the small side.",0
There is a waterslide for kids of all ages to take advantage of as well.,0
There's also a kiddie pool and 2 hot tubs for you to use when not crowded already.,1
There's a path that leads out to the dock where you can take the ferry to the Magic Kingdom or over to Fort Wilderness.,0
"Set among a number of weeping willow trees, walking along here adds to the rustic feel of the atmosphere felt all over the Wilderness Lodge Resort.",0
"If you're back in the lobby facing the Service Desk, there's another walkway to the left of it, leading to, among other things, the bus stop from which you can make your way to the theme parks, other resorts, or anything else within Disney property.",0
"Also, along this way is the resort arcade, containing a number of video games for the children, and the Wilderness Lodge Mercantile, a general store of sorts from which you can purchase snacks, shirts, toys, or personal supplies.",0
"( QUICK TIP ) - I found on my last visit that some of the same snack items can be found both in the Roaring Forks eatery as well as in the Wilderness Lodge Mercantile, in some cases cheaper in one of these spots or the other.",0
"I'm not sure why, but on several items I found this to be the case.",0
You may want to check before you decide to get some snacks from either spot.,0
***ROOMS***,0
"The rooms are pretty straightforward hotel rooms: beds (queen size, king size, bunk, or whichever you reserve your room with ), table, chairs, drawers, small fridge, small TV, sink area outside toilet and shower room.",0
My only real complaint about the room is that it was pretty small with few extras for the price we were paying for it per day.,0
"Also, the beds take up most of the width of the room and the corners of the beds only come up so far so that it's really easy to bump your shin on it while walking through the room.",0
I can't even remember how many bruises I ended up having on my leg from hitting against the corner of the bed.,1
"There's also a small balcony and depending on what you're willing to pay for the room, you get either a view of the woods that hide the resort from the road, or you get a beautiful view overlooking the pool area and Bay Lake.",0
I would prefer this view if only for the nightly view of the Electric Water Pageant that makes its way around the lake displaying some brightly colored light pictures while music plays.,0
***ROOM RATES***,0
"There are 4 main time periods, or seasons, during which the room rates vary.",0
"Disney calls them"" Value"","" Peak"","" Regular"", and"" Holiday"" time.",0
"Believe me, you want to be sure of which time period your vacation falls into because you could either be paying ( according to 2002 prices ) $ 194 per night or upwards of $ 309.",0
"There are a number of Internet websites, including Disney's own, that will give you the exact time frame for each season and some that can provide you instructions for calling and getting some pretty good discounts on resort rooms.",0
"For example, check out www.mousesavers.com",0
and you'll see what I mean.,0
***TRANSPORTATION***,0
"As mentioned earlier, there's a dock for the ferry and there's a bus-stop in front of the resort.",0
These are the main two means of getting to whereever you wish to go in Disney World.,0
"Unfortunately, the resort is too far out to be included on the monorail line, but that's a minor quibble of mine because I enjoy riding along Disney's monorail.",0
"The ferry ride is very relaxing, especially on a beautifully sunny, cloudless day, either when going to or coming from a day at the Magic Kingdom.",0
"The Disney buses run pretty regularly, every 20 minutes or so, so you'll always have a way to get around, unless you have your own car or a rental.",0
I had a minor complaint on the last visit with the buses not quite being on time.,1
I believe on several occasions we ended up waiting there nearly 30 minutes which is pretty aggravating for those already impatient in wanting to get to the parks and on those rides.,0
***FINAL THOUGHTS***,0
"I had a truly great time during my stay at the Wilderness Lodge, I really did.",0
"Not many may take the time to check out the resort because they're so busy wanting to see and do everything they can in Disney World, but I advise you as a potential future guest to walk through it and see what you can.",1
"From the moment you set foot through the door, you get a very cozy, inviting, warm feeling from the place and that feeling lasts the entire length of your stay.",0
"The service is great, you get a good night's rest, and as a resort guest are also treated to free refills on coffee after your initial purchase of a resort mug.",0
"Wilderness Lodge is an extremely well-done Disney resort, very relaxing, a treat to stay at, and you're guaranteed to have a great time in an already great vacation destination.",0
If you have never stayed at a Disney resort prepared to be wowed by the Wilderness Lodge.,1
The themes are carried to the hilt and the service is unbelievable.,0
I have only been to Disney twice but we have stayed at the lodge both times.,0
During our visit this September our daughter came down with a 102.4 degree fever.,0
"While I was freaking out about being stuck at the resort without a vehicle, the resort managers arranged to have Judy, a wonderfully friendly front desk clerk, drive us the full twenty minutes to After Hours Pediatrics.",1
She also came to pick us up when when we were ready.,0
"The next morning a personalized, autographed picture of the Little Mermaid was slid under our door wishing that Emily would feel well enough to come visit in person.",0
"Needless to say, the service and amenities far exceeded my expectations.",0
The children are truly the guest at Disney and they are treated as specially as the paying adults are treated.,0
"While you should prepare to spend a pretty penny to stay in the park, the service and convenience make it worth it.",0
"Not only are you able to purchase the Ultimate Park Hopper ticket (unavailable to those not staying on site ), you are right in the middle of the action, you dont have to fight traffic, and you are able to make it back to your room in about 15 minutes from anywhere in the Walt Disney World complex.",1
"While I have nt stayed in other Disney resorts, this hotel is described by the cast members as the frequent guests  favorite.",1
The lodge is booked when other resorts are bare.,0
Prepared to be impressed.,0
Logistics,0
"The Wilderness Lodge is one of what are sometimes called the"" Magic Kingdom Resorts"" at Walt Disney World.",0
It is considered one of the deluxe resorts which means it is a little more expensive than most of the other Disney Resorts.,0
It is located in close proximity to the Magic Kingdom.,0
"While the resort is not on the monorail line, you can hop on a boat to the Magic Kingdom or take a bus to anywhere else on Disney property.",1
We took a towncar from the airport and did not have a car the whole trip.,0
"Aside from the unexpected illness, we would never have needed a vehicle.",1
Disney provides great access to transportation and every cast member is ready to provide detailed directions and tips for getting to your desired destination quickly.,0
Is This Really Florida?,0
The resort itself is modeled after a lodge that you might find in one of the country's national parks.,0
When you first enter the lodge you immediately notice the grand openness of the design.,0
The lobby is filled with little seating areas for you to rest your tired feet.,0
There are large totem poles and a beautiful 80 foot tall fireplace.,0
The chandeliers are designed to look like tee pees and there are Indian artifacts in cases throughout the lobby.,0
The Wilderness Lodge also has a small alcove for children to watch a Disney cartoon while Mom and Dad check into the room.,0
At the back of the lobby is a wooden bridge that spans a bubbling brook.,0
It turns into a little stream that flows out of the lobby and appears to flow into the swimming pool outside ( though I doubt it actually does ).,0
There are always kids running back and forth over the bridge they can't resist!,1
I love the way the atmosphere makes you feel relaxed.,0
I felt like I could lounge in the lobby chairs and not be overly concerned with how fancy my clothes were or whether my daughter was running in circles around the coffee table.,1
"The large service desk is divided into two sections, one for checking in and out and another section for guest services.",0
It does normally take some time to check into your room since there is more than the normal information to go over.,0
""" Cast Members"" often give guests tips to further enjoy the park.",0
"The cast members also have""goody bags"" for children that include some stickers a couple of coloring pamphlets and some crayons.",0
The guest service desk is typically used to arrange childcare or Priority Seating at resort restaurants after you have checked in.,0
Check in is normally 3:00 pm.,0
"However, we arrived around noon and our room was available.",0
This is not guaranteed as I did notice other families that were waiting at the pool until their room was ready.,1
The resort consists of two wings with seven floors and 728 rooms.,0
The seventh floor is reserved for concierge rooms and is not accessible from the elevator without swiping your room key.,1
We stayed on the second floor right by the elevator.,0
"While we were there in a typically quiet season, the hallways remained quiet and there always seemed to be an elevator waiting for us when we needed one.",0
There are 3 room views available.,0
"-The Standard View faces the parking lot, driveway, or the roof;",0
-The Woods View faces the woods on one side and the Wilderness Lodge Villas on the other;,0
#NAME?,0
We stayed in a Woods View room that looked out on a swamp and trees.,0
It was peaceful and there were often birds near the water that my daughter enjoyed watching.,0
Pricing,0
Prices differ based on the season.,0
The standard room which has 2 queens or a queen with bunk beds ranges from $ 199/night to $ 324/night.,0
The concierge rate ranges from $ 250/night to $ 385/night.,0
There are differing views and honeymoon suites  that offer different amenities and price ranges.,0
"Okay, Now Onto the Rooms Themselves",0
The door of the actual room opens to a hallway with a small 3-4 drawer chest to the left as well as a closet with sliding doors that includes a small safe.,0
There is a an alcove to the right that has a nice black marble sink and mirror.,0
You can access the functional bathroom from a door on the right.,0
In this room is the normal shower and toilet.,0
In addition to the towel rack there is hook to hang clothes or wet towels on as well as a clothes line that can be pulled across the length of the bathtub.,0
The sleeping area in the room we stayed had two queen size beds with a night stand between them.,0
The beds were on wooden frames that lent themselves to frequent toe stubbings but the sheets were soft and the pillows were fluffy.,0
The room was furnished with a wooden table with two chairs as well as a dresser with 3 or four drawers on the bottom and an television cabinet on the top.,0
All of the furniture was very good quality and was decorated with a southwestern/Indian theme.,0
The colors were a muted turquoise and orange and the wooden furniture was a rich maple color.,0
"Lastly, there were sliding glass doors that led to a small balcony.",0
It has a small glass topped table and two all-weather chairs.,0
To my delight the hotel was constructed to provide privacy on these balconies.,0
You cannot see your neighbors balcony and they cannot see yours.,1
Shopping,0
The hotel amenities include the usual gift shop with a wilderness theme.,0
The shop sells snacks and a small selection of hygiene and over the counter medical products.,0
There is plenty there to satisfy your souvenir sweet tooth.,0
"In the lobby is one of Disneys ubiquitous Pin trading stations, and an information table for the Disney Vacation Club.",0
Dining,0
The Whispering Canyon Caf provides delicious family style barbeque dinners.,0
"While we enjoyed the dinner at the restaurant twice the first time we stayed, we only were able to go for breakfast this time.",0
The food was outstanding.,0
"The prices for breakfast were reasonable, but for dinner expect to pay $ 40-50 for a family of three.",0
Normally this seems steep to me but it is comparable to any other sit-down restaurant at Disney.,0
"If you enjoy Disneys famous themed restaurants, youll love this.",0
The servers move through out the dining room using the tray stands to make galloping  sounds.,0
They frequently yell woo-hoo and scream who has the ketchup  whenever someone asks.,0
In the evenings they also have stick horse races around the restaurant for the kids.,0
The kids love it.,0
"If you are looking for a quiet, calm place to relax and eat your dinner, you might want to visit the Artists Pointe.",0
The Artists Pointe restaurant is an elegant dining alternative for those who would like to enjoy a little higher end dining.,0
"I have not been to this restaurant, but it has been described as"" a celebration of the rich culinary heritage of the Pacific Northwest"".",1
"The menu is seasonal and includes selections indigenous to the Washington, Oregon and British Columbia coastlines.",0
"Roaring Forks is cafeteria-type dining and offers burgers, fries, pizza, chili, bagels, deli sandwiches, Rice Krispie treats, beverages and other fresh and fast selections.",0
"While the prices are high for my standards - you can pay $ 6.00 for turkey on a croissant, the food is good and just right for a quick lunch by the pool.",0
"The Territory Lounge serves cocktails, espresso and cappuccino as well as appetizers in the evening.",0
There are also refreshments available at the Trouts Pass bass by the pool and room service from Miss Jennys In-Room Dining.,0
Entertainment,0
"The Wilderness Resorts pool is huge, clean, and definitely relaxing!",0
"It has a waterslide that runs through a rock formation, a separate baby pool and two hot tubs.",0
You can go down to the beach but I have not been to the water to tell you whether it s swim-able  or not.,1
But you will want to go down to watch the geyser that erupts hourly on the beach.,0
"If you exit the hotel near the gift shop you will find a video game room that I think is called"" Buttons and Bells"".",0
It is larger than the average hotel arcade and offers newer games as well as the old stand-bys such as centipede and pinball.,0
If you decide to venture to Downtown Disney you can use the babysitting services available at the Cub's Den.,0
The Cub's Den can be accessed by an entrance near the arcade.,0
"The room is chock full of video games, Disney toys, books, craft supplies and Disney movies.",0
"While the cost is a little steep at $ 10 an hour, they provided dinner and my daughter had a wonderful time.",0
I highly recommend the services.,0
I felt comfortable my daughter was well cared for as it was staffed by two grandmotherly women who seemed to love taking care of children.,0
It afforded us the opportunity to see more than Mickey and the Princesses and have an adult conversation.,0
Most of all our daughter was out like a light on a cot when we went to pick her up.,0
"While I am sure some families used the service every night of the week, once was enough for us to enjoy an evening of adult activity.",0
To Sum it Up,0
Looking at some of the other reviews I am not the only one to recommend Disney's Wilderness Lodge.,1
"Not only does it allow you to escape everything that is Mickey for at least a while, it makes you feel at home.",1
"It is clean, beautiful and the cast members are indulgent and responsive.",0
Disney's Wilderness Lodge is definitely a one-of-a-kind resort.,0
"Complete with a working geyser and a river that flows through the lobby, this resort is themed as a western lodge.",0
"My family and I have been staying at Disney's Polynesian Resort since it first opened, and we've been hooked on it!",0
"Then we decided to try something different, that's where the Wilderness Lodge came in.",0
"As soon as you enter, the beautiful 6 story lobby surrounds you.",0
"The check-in process was smooth most of the time, as it is in all Disney hotels ( with the exception of the time when they booked us for December 31, 2000 instead of December 31, 1999! ).",0
The rooms are nice and have good views pretty much all around.,0
Getting a room with bunk beds is a nice feature as well.,0
Disney certainly has spared no expense putting together this resort.,1
"Outside, there's a huge pool, and an awesome waterslide that starts inside a rock.",0
There are paths leading all over so there are many picture taking spots.,0
"The transportation to and from the resort poses a serious problem, however.",0
"The monorail resorts ( Polynesian, Grand Floridian, and Contemporary ) are very convenient because you can just hop on a monorail and go to the Magic Kingdom or EPCOT.",0
"On the contrary, here you must wait for a crowded bus to come, sometimes for 20-30 minutes!",0
"There is also boat transportation, but that is also slow, and is kind of uncomfortable in the heat.",0
Another problem with the resort is the restaurants.,0
I guess they're just not my style.,1
"The Artist's Point Restaurant features mostly fish, and the other restaurant is southern food.",0
"The only food we could really eat here was in the Roaring Forks snack bar, but there's so many other restaurants located throughout the Walt Disney World Resort property.",0
"The Wilderness Lodge will certainly be an experience you will never forget, and I would recommend this to anyone, especially families with children of any age.",1
You'll always remember our stay at The Wilderness Lodge!,0
"Yes, I know.",0
Pretty corny.,0
But how often do you get to say it and really mean it?,0
I was fortunate enough to stay at the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco on business while covering a conference being held at the hotel.,0
"Normally, my company would not put me in such a luxurious hotel, but sometimes I get lucky.",1
This was one of those times and I definitely enjoyed it.,0
Whisk Me Away to a Wonderful Room,0
After a smooth check-in I was soon settling into my room and feeling pretty much like a princess.,0
"The room was large and rectangular with a big, luscious king-size bed.",0
A fluffy down coverlet on a deliciously inviting bed was more than I could resist.,0
"Before even unpacking my bags, I found myself lying on this very comfy bed, looking around a tastefully decorated room.",0
"The armoire held a 25 inch television and there was a writing desk, as well as two upholstered chairs.",0
My room had two large windows that were draped in softly muted colors.,0
I found myself wishing that my master bedroom at home was as large and comfortably furnished.,0
A Great Bathroom,0
Next on my list to explore was the bathroom.,0
And it certainly did not disappoint.,1
"The Italian marble sparkled and large, fluffy towels awaited me.",0
There were double sinks with plenty of room for me to stash my necessities.,0
"At times like this I really wish I was a bath person, instead of a shower person.",0
I would probably have enjoyed soaking in a hot bubbly tub and admiring the beautiful surroundings.,0
Plenty of Extras,0
"There was a nice large closet, complete with two terry bathrobes, ironing board and iron, as well as extra pillows and blankets.",0
I would not be lacking for anything in the room.,1
The Overall Elegance,0
"After admiring my room and finally unpacking, it was time for me to get ready for dinner.",0
We had reservations for our group and I wanted a little time before dinner to look around the hotel.,0
The sounds of a grand piano drew me toward a beautiful high-ceiling room that looked almost as much like a cathedral as it did a hotel.,0
It was very beautifully and elegantly decorated.,0
I remember lots of fresh flowers and large paintings and well-dressed people buzzing about.,0
"I didn't want to dawdle too long, staring like a country girl come to town for the first time.",0
But being my usual bumpkinish self I had to take in the atmosphere for a while before following the hallway toward the dining room.,0
"Dinner for 10, Please",0
We had a fairly large party ( about 10 of us ) so we were seated at a long table.,0
The service was excellent and the dinner had been pre-arranged for us with a choice of chicken or beef.,0
The beef medallions were tasty and tender and served with fresh vegetables.,0
They were preceeded by a crisp salad and fresh bread.,0
"Pass the butter, please!",0
"The dining room was elegant, yet not so formal that I felt uncomfortable.",1
We took our time enjoying our meal and chatting with fellow employees we hadn't seen in a while.,0
"Ah, Room Service!",0
"The following day, I had breakfast delivered to my room.",0
( One of the great joys of business travel for me. ),0
It was so nice going to the door in my Ritz bathrobe and letting the waiter deliver my food.,0
"I'm certain I went over my meal allowance but the bacon was crisp, the juice was freshly-squeezed, and the pastries were delicious.",0
My breakfast was promptly and courteously served and most definitely enjoyed.,0
Meeting Facilities,0
The hotel can accommodate several fairly large meetings in the banquet area.,0
"Our meeting was held in a large high-ceilinged ballroom, with lovely chandeliers throughout the room.",0
The wide hallways and high ceilings were excellent for people milling around without feeling cramped.,1
"There was a very basic lunch served as part of the meeting ( cold sandwiches, chips, and drinks ).",0
"As each of the participants had to pay the cost of lunch as part of the attendance fee, they had chosen one of the more economical options.",0
It was certainly nothing like the dinner we had the evening before.,0
"As soon as the meeting ended, I couldn't wait to get back to my room, change clothes and go walk around the Nob Hill area a bit.",0
Very Nice Overall Experience,0
I had no complaints at all about the Ritz-Carlton during my stay.,1
"The room was comfortable with everything I needed, the food was good, and the service prompt and polite.",0
As I was only there for two days and busy with a conference I didn't get to check out all the available facilities at the hotel but everything I experienced was excellent.,0
The Ritz Carlton knows how to make you feel special on a day of celebration.,0
"People of all ages were in the tea room enjoying an afternoon with friends or family, most for a special occasion.",0
"I was there with my father and some friends, celebrating my birthday.",0
The first thing that struck me was how the staff made their clientele feel absolutely regal.,0
"My father had told me to tell them that I was there to meet him""at the sofa in the corner.""",0
"It sounded very cryptic, but as soon as I told the hostess, she nodded knowingly as if my arrival was something they had been waiting for all week!",0
We were seated and our other guests arrived and we each ordered from the tea menu.,0
There were four menus to choose from with prices ranging from $ 21 for the smallest tea to $ 38 for the most luxurious.,0
"Our group ordered two Full Teas, a Vegetarian Tea, and a Royal Tea.",0
"Beautiful tea sandwiches came in a lovely assortment of Norwegian Smoked Salmon with Pickled Onion and Caviar, Cucumber, Roquefort and Walnuts, Prosciutto and Asparagus Tips, Egg and Chive, and Tomato and Mozarella on Foccacia.",0
"In addition to the dainty sandwiches, all menus offered sophisticated tea cakes, madeleines, tartlettes, and scones, with a delicious lemon curd and cream.",0
The Royal Tea included a champagne cocktail of choice and a bowl of fresh strawberries and cream.,0
The menu for the choices of hot tea was two pages long and included some wonderful blends.,0
I was seduced by the sound of China Rose tea and was told that my choice is the most popular at the Ritz Carlton.,0
"Others in my party chose vanilla, which smelled divine, and mint.",0
No one was disappointed with their choice of tea.,1
My choice was soothing and indulgent and it was constantly refilled and kept warm for my enjoyment.,0
We were surprised that we became full on our afternoon tea.,0
"At first glance of the tea sandwiches, my boyfriend groaned with misery at the thought of remaining hungry for the afternoon, but by the time we were finishing off the pastries, he was refusing another bite.",0
Everything is surprisingly filling and can keep you appeased until a late dinner.,0
"Also, I've been told that people are welcome to request additional sandwiches or pastries, but I don't actually know of anyone who has ever tried that.",1
"Personally, I'd feel a bit sheepish!",0
Service was almost flawless and we were made to feel like royalty.,0
It was a wonderful treat for my birthday celebration.,0
I was presented with a surprise plate of strawberries and cream with candles and a happy birthday message drizzled in chocolate on the edge of the plate.,0
It was a wonderful alternative to those restaurants where the waiters embarrass you by singing a birthday song and clapping in your face.,0
My surprise dessert at the Ritz Carlton was wonderfully subtle and allowed the moment to be enjoyed by the people at my table and not the whole room!,1
"The one drawback was that they accidentally brought this surprise to me while my boyfriend was in the bathroom, so we had to wait for him to return with the candle wax spilling all over the cream!",0
"I highly recommend an afternoon tea for a nice celebration or just for taking time to spend a leisurely afternoon with someone, talking and indulging.",0
I look forward to taking tea more often.,0
"I think trips to the Ritz Carlton may not be in my regular schedule, but I am researching slightly less expensive places to take tea in San Francisco.",1
Please check back as I will surely be reviewing other afternoon teas!,0
"Update May 18, 2001: Took another afternoon tea with Mom for Mother's Day.",0
"Lovely service as the first time, tea was a little oversteeped.",0
"But I did find out that the China Rose Petal tea that I love is made by Taylors of Harrogate, an English tea company.",0
I found that you can order it on http://www.virtualtea.com/,0
I highly recommend this tea!,0
"The minute that I pulled up to this hotel, I was awaited by the bell man in their proper blue jackets, welcoming us to one of the greatest cities in the country, San Francisco.",0
"This was my first time here, and I knew that staying at the Ritz would certainly not displease me, but the overall stay was much better than what I imagined.",1
There was so much to do just inside the hotel that it made touring the city seem boring.,0
"First of all, there are many restaurants located throughout the large hotel.",0
"Anything from the garden restaurant, to the little lobby restaurant for tea and cookies, to the award winning dining room, voted the best in San Francisco.",0
"Though, beware, look at the prices before you order.",0
"Nothing here is cheap, but there is not doubt that it is worth it.",1
"After a long day of touring the city, why not go for a swim in the amazing health center?",1
"There is an indoor pool, masseuse, and an incredible exercise room fitting all of your needs.",0
"Then, stop by the concierge to get a recommendation for the best restaurants in town, if you want to leave the hotel of course.",0
"If you are not in the mood to leave your room, there are many hit movies to choose from, and room service is exquisite.",1
"Anything from a business trip to a family vacation, The Ritz can make anyone feel satisfied.",0
"This hotel has modern amenities, but still keeps the charm and luxury of historical San Francisco.",0
This is certainly an extraordinary hotel which would make any stay in San Francisco an amazing one.,0
The title of my epinion is a quote from our waiter our very first evening at this beautiful resort.,0
The Hyatt Regency Kauai is paradise.,0
I've never stayed anywhere else that even comes close to being as nice.,1
Service,0
"Ordinarily, I'd start off a hotel/resort review with a description the rooms but what makes the Hyatt Regency Kauai unique is the service.",0
You never are made to feel as if you are an imposition or that all you are valued for is the money in your pockets.,1
"As soon as you drive up to the front entrance, you are greeted by a bellhop who takes your luggage and opens the beautiful double doors for you to enter the lobby.",0
The rest of the lobby is completely open air so I'm not sure if the doors are for show or not.,1
You are given a lei and escorted to the check in desk.,0
"Both times I've stayed here, my basic standard parking lot view room has been upgraded.",0
We don't spend a lot of time in our room so I don't like to pay for a view.,1
I'll walk outside to see the ocean!,0
"For our first stay, we received a garden view room with a gorgeous view of blooming plumeria trees, multi-colored crotons, birds of paradise and the opportunity to see some weddings take place.",0
"The second time, we received a partial ocean view room.",0
Our second stay was a last minute decision as we were traveling with my in-laws.,0
They had made reservations at the Aston Poipu Kai where our condo was absolutely unacceptable.,0
"It was filthy, hot and there was a bedspring literally sticking out of the mattress.",0
I called the Hyatt upon our check-in at the Aston.,0
"They were sold out for that night but found us rooms for the rest of our stay, and at a discounted rate too!",0
"During one stay, we had some problems with our rental car and even though the automobile company's desk had closed for the evening, the concierge went out of her way to make sure that the rental car company drove out immediately with a replacement car for us.",0
"Another time, we had scheduled a Na Pali Coast boat tour and we were canceled on three days in a row for various problems ( with more than one company! ).",0
The concierge found us two spots on another company's boat for the last day of our honeymoon.,0
"Unfortunately, that too was canceled ( by weather ) but the fact that someone tried very hard to make our vacation special meant a lot to us.",0
Rooms,0
"For both visits, I had a room in the Poipu wing of the hotel.",0
There are two wings ( Poipu and Shipwreck ) and each can be a long walk to the lobby area.,0
The rooms are very large and each of them has a lamp in the shape of a rooster.,0
"Since there are so many roosters running around in the wild on Kauai, it seemed appropriate.",0
"Besides the rooster lamp, you'll find a complimentary in-room safe, coffee maker, ceiling fan, large private balcony, hair dryer, marble tubs and sinks and some really nice bath amenities.",0
The shampoo and conditioner is manufactured by Emlin and is one of the few I've tried that really get your hair squeaky clean after being out in salt water all day without damaging your hair.,1
We also received a small sample of the Anara Spa's Coco Mango lotion.,0
It has the most luxurious scent and is quite addictive.,0
You can order additional lotion directly from the resort spa.,0
"If you wish to pay extra or have enough Gold Passport points, you may wish to reserve a Regency Club room which includes complimentary refreshments throughout the day.",0
"Even if you don't wish to upgrade, be sure to join the Hyatt Gold Passport program ( it's free! ) or give them your membership number.",1
"You'll receive a daily newsletter with all of the resort activities, news clips and some very good recipes to try when you return home.",0
Be sure to check the number of servings in these recipes so as not to make the mistake I did when baking up some pineapple-coconut muffins.,1
I ended up with 4 dozen of them!,0
Pools and Landscaping,0
Everything is open air at the resort except for the hallways to the guest rooms.,0
The landscaping was absolutely breathtaking with flowers everywhere.,0
The plumeria were a special favorite and you can smell the flowers in the air everywhere.,0
The smell is my absolute favorite thing about the Hyatt.,0
It's intoxicating.,0
One of the neatest things about the Hyatt is the use of water.,0
They have a giant koi pond with what must be at least a hundred fish.,0
"Below that is a bi-level free form freshwater"" action pool"" which includes a water slide, caves and waterfalls.",0
Right below those is a salt water lagoon on a gypsum beach since the regular sand was clogging their filters.,0
"In the middle of the lagoon is an island with a hammock - if you don't want to swim, there are plenty of hammocks around the lagoon.",1
We really enjoyed those!,0
"If you continue walking, below the saltwater lagoon, you'll find Shipwreck Beach and the Pacific Ocean.",0
The beach is often marked with red flags indicating high surf.,0
That means don't go in the water!,1
Many people drown in Hawaii every year when they disregard the warning flags.,0
Also at the beach is a large cliff where we often saw young men jumping into the waves.,0
It looked scary to me!,0
"A word of caution if you visit: after it rains, the steps and walkways around the pools are extremely slippery.",0
We didn't have any problems but there probably have been some in the past.,0
Another really neat thing about Hawaii in general is that they don't have thunderstorms or lightning unless there's a hurricane or something terribly out of the ordinary.,1
There is absolutely no need to get out of the water when it rains.,1
"The Hyatt is located in the Poipu Beach region of Kauai, which is on the"" sunny"" side of the island.",0
It really only rained a little bit on the last day and a half of our first stay ( which was in the month of June - our second time was an October visit ).,0
"If you have any interest in scuba, they have complimentary beginner lessons!",0
Towels are available by the pool as are wristbands to allow you to ride the water slide.,0
Resort Activities,0
"One evening, we attended a video screening in Stevenson's Library ( a bar ) at the Hyatt.",0
"This video showed the destruction and power of Hurricane Iniki, which struck the island in September of 1992.",0
This was a terribly sobering video and it really caused us to open our eyes when we were driving around the island.,0
"If you look carefully, you can still see some of the effects of this terrible storm.",0
Kauai still hasn't recovered in terms of tourism so the island has a deserted feel to it in many places.,0
"The island only has a full-time population of about 50,000.",0
The video also recounted how the Hyatt was the only hotel on Kauai to retain all of their employees on the payroll throughout the rebuilding process after Iniki.,0
The hotel was closed for six months!,0
"We know it was a""propaganda feel good"" video but it really made us respect the employees and the management at the Hyatt.",0
"Aside from the videotape, you can play golf, tennis, or billiards, go horseback riding or take advantage of the many Hawaiiana classes they offer ranging from hula dancing to lei making.",0
"Every morning, there is a walking tour of the award winning Poipu Bay golf course.",0
There is a special camp for children as well as the Anara Spa for the ultimate in relaxation.,0
Shopping,0
This isn't pushed at all at resort guests.,1
"There are two sundries shops that I came across as well as a couple of resort clothing stores, a sandal shop and a fine art gallery.",0
The emphasis at the Hyatt Regency Kauai is that you have the opportunity to shop if there is something you need or would like but they aren't going to highly advertise these stores to you.,0
I spent a long time one evening in the art gallery talking with one of the sales clerks.,0
They were exhibiting a number of lucite sculptures by the late Frederic Hart and I used to work at the Washington National Cathedral where his most famous sculpture is on display.,0
I learned a lot that evening and also discovered the works of another artist I really enjoy ( Fanch Ledon ).,0
Dining,0
You have many choices at this resort so there's no need to go elsewhere unless you really want to.,1
"One night for dinner, we tried Tidepools where we spent $ 100 on a main course, appetizer and drinks.",0
You're paying for the relaxed atmosphere.,0
The restaurant is set up in grass thatched huts right on the koi pond.,0
The food was excellent food too!,0
We started with a shared appetizer of tropical fruits.,0
One thing we found throughout the islands is that a lot of papaya was served and not as much pineapple as we expected.,1
My husband had the blackened Opaka and I had the grilled Ahi.,0
"To be honest, he also had the grilled Ahi because I only ate half of it!",0
I'd say this is the most romantic of the restaurants in the hotel.,0
Be sure to request a table right next to the water.,0
The Ilima Terrace features both breakfast buffets and a theme dinner buffet.,0
I've had the dinner buffet three times ( over the total of 14 nights I've been at the resort )and I don't think I'd go back again when there are so many other place to eat.,1
"One evening, the theme was surf and turf.",0
You could get a lobster or carved prime rib or both.,0
That was the best of our experiences there.,0
"The last time, the meat was cold and not cooked through enough.",1
"I like rare meat but this meat was raw, not rare.",1
The selection just wasn't very good.,0
"Service was excellent, however.",0
"If a light dinner is what you're seeking, Stevenson's Library is a good place to go.",0
You can settle down to listen to some jazz in a cozy book-lined room or go out on an ocean view terrace.,0
We've enjoyed the pizza here as well as the fondue.,0
Another specialty here is one you can get elsewhere in the resort but my husband has a special fondness for it so I'll mention it here.,0
The drink is called a lava flow.,0
It's basically a pina colada with pureed strawberries.,0
They are very good and very addictive.,0
I have not attended the Drums of Paradise Luau but I have passed it by while the show was underway.,1
"Hearing a version of"" Wind Beneath My Wings"" accompanied by a slack-key guitar is not my idea of a luau.",1
This seemed quite cheesy but I didn't actually attend it.,1
"If you have and enjoyed it, please let me know.",0
We have greatly enjoyed the Old Lahaina Luau on Maui so we're not against all luaus by any means.,1
The Dock is a great place to grab a light lunch or a snack.,0
This is the place to get a small container of freshly cut pineapple.,0
"I like to get my snack and go out to a hammock to read a book, enjoy the snack and relax in the sunshine while enjoying the cool, tropical breezes.",0
Paradise is just where you are.,0
There are waitresses who will come by on a semi-regular basis to bring you drinks so there's no need to get up.,1
The last place I've personally tried is the Seaview Terrace.,0
This was a good place to grab a light breakfast of a muffin or some juice.,0
"Often, there is live entertainment here of a Hawaiian singer or a hula dancer.",0
"A couple of evenings a week, they have a keiki show which is comprised of children from a local hula school.",0
Quality of the show varies depending upon the talents of the current crop of students.,0
Other dining choices include Dondero's which is supposed to be a fabulous Italian restaurant and a restaurant in the Anara Spa.,0
Wrap Up,0
There's a reason why this resort has consistently received top ratings from Conde Nast.,0
It's hard to find much wrong with it.,0
"The service is friendly, accommodating and the employees go out of their way to make your vacation as perfect as it can possibly be.",0
That attitude is what makes the Hyatt Regency Kauai special.,0
"Without that, all you have is the empty shell of a resort.",1
It's the heart that makes the difference.,0
On our last trip to Hawaii my husband and I cashed in our frequent flier miles with American Airlines for free airfare.,0
"As an added bonus, we were given 50 % off discount certificates for certain hotels on the various islands.",0
We decided to take advantage of these certificates while on the island of Kauai.,0
"While on Kauai, we stayed at the Hyatt Regency and are so glad that we did.",0
"We would never have spent the $ 350 a night room rate, especially for a one week stay, but using the discount certificates brought the rate down to a more affordable $ 175 a night which was within our hotel budget for that island.",1
The first thing you will notice about this hotel is its open space design.,0
Both the lobby and all hallways to the rooms were open to the gorgeous Hawaiian weather.,0
The lobby is adorned with lush gardens filled with colorful tropical plants and flowers.,0
"Alongside the gardens are beautiful tropical birds, some in cages some sitting on perches.",0
What a relaxing atmosphere.,0
I was able to spend some time sitting on the comfortable benches just enjoying the scenery each morning.,0
The rooms are spacious.,0
You do not get that cramped feeling I have experienced in many hotel rooms.,1
"In addition to the bed were two comfortable chairs, and dresser/entertainment unit and two nightstands.",0
The bathroom had a shower/tub combination and a marble topped double basin vanity area ( that is great for when two people are trying to get ready at the same time ).,0
I liked that there are shelves on each side of the vanity area for each persons personal items.,0
I helped to keep the bathroom looking neater.,0
"There was also a separate area for the toilet with its own door, allowing for privacy while your partner is showering or getting ready.",0
The resort area of the hotel is equally incredible.,0
"There is an adult pool, a pool with a waterslide as well as several hot tubs nestled between the waterfalls and tropical foliage.",0
"While these are beautiful themselves, I was highly impressed with the vast saltwater lagoon that is sprinkled with several small""islands"" with their own hammocks swaying between palm trees.",0
"We ate at the"" Tidepools"" restaurant on the hotel property.",0
The restaurants atmosphere was extremely romantic.,0
"We were seated in a gazebo like structure, sitting in the middle of a pond complete with Koi fish.",0
The waiter suggested the grilled seafood platter.,0
Our tastebuds were delighted with the luscious flavors of freshly grilled shrimp and lobster complimented by a tropical fruit salsa.,0
The waiter did great with his suggestion to order that night's special.,0
"If you are ever fortunate enough to visit the beautiful island of Kauai, try to stay at the Hyatt Regency, you won't be disappointed.",0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
Please note that I do not regularly have my girlfriend shove crutches up my a*s.,1
This refers to an isolated incident of about 3 years ago of joking around with her and a mutual friend where they basically poked at my ( clothed ) butt with a crutch.,0
"They ended up hitting me in the nuts, which, to say the least, was probably better than what the director of this film did to the memory of Dr.Seuss.",0
"Tonight, I feel violated.",0
"Yes, even more violated than the incident above made me feel.",0
And I feel more violated for one simple reason above all: I paid to be violated tonight.,0
"I paid to be violated by Mike Myers, Bo Welch ( director ), and Alec Berg, David Mandel, and Jeff Schaffer ( the writers ).",0
"I paid to see one of my most cherished childhood authors, Dr.Seuss, be violated in the most basic sense of the term.",0
"I had such high hopes for this flick ( calling this a'film' would be an insult to true'films' ), and I honestly thought that Myers would be able to bring a spastic, if childlike charm, to the role of The Cat.",0
"But there is nothing charming about Myers or his Cat, or this abomination they dare to put Dr. Seuss' name on.",0
"Sure, it's all based on characters created by the good doctor years ago, but it all feels like one big bathroom joke that isn't funny in the very least.",1
"Hell, I might've laughed more the one time I was forced to sit through Biodome than I laughed at this garbage.",0
"The plot, if one can call it that, revolves around a pair of children, Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ) and Sally ( Dakota Fanning ) who are as opposite as opposite can get.",0
"Conrad is a little hell raiser, while Sally is the goody two shoes who mommy ( Joan, played by Kelly Preston ) adores.",0
"Alec Baldwin plays a seedy next door neighbor who is dating Joan, and whose one goal in life is seemingly to be as disgusting as possible while making sure Conrad gets shipped off to military school so he can move in.",0
"As mom plans to host a big party at home for her obsessive compulsive neat freak boss ( Mr. Humberfloob, played by Sean Hayes ), the kids are told not to ruin the house, and are left with a noodling, overweight babysitter who falls asleep faster than Granpa does on The Simpsons.",1
"Enter the Cat, who helps to ruin the house, anger the kids, and pull so many shenanigans in one day your head will spin...or hurt.",0
While the last Dr.,0
"Seuss big screen adaptation wasn't anything all that hot either ( The Grinch ), at least it felt like it had some of that Dr. Seuss heart to it, and Jim Carrey at least brought something to the role that so many thought he didn't belong in.",1
"This however, doesn't work in the least.",1
"Myers spends the whole movie acting as if he had 6 too many Jolt colas, and when he isn't completely aping one of his better known characters ( i.e.",1
"Fat Bastard from the Austin Powers series ), his main Cat voice sounds like a mix of Powers and his SNL alter-ego Linda Richman.",0
It's f*cking embarrassing and not the least bit funny.,1
"In fact, I found it rather irritating and about 20 minutes after his first appearance, I suddenly longed to be in any other theatre, even if it would have meant seeing the biggest chick flick of all time.",0
"The so-called'humor,' as mentioned above, is so pandering, so foul, and so UN-SEUSS, that you'll wonder how in the world this ever got the OK from good old Ted's estate ( Evidently a few million bucks is worth the price of a man's legacy ).",0
"If there is one good thing about this movie, it is that Seuss' legacy lives on in the imaginative, bright, and colorful sets, backgrounds, and costumes ( Myers' Cat suit aside ).",0
"This, along with the two kids' performances, are the only things worthwhile about this movie, and trust me, they aren't even worth the price of a RENTAL, nevermind a full price ticket to a theatre.",1
I hope Mike Myers is happy with this gigantic piece of donkey crud he dared to make.,0
I hope that Bo Welch gets run out of Hollywood for this.,0
And I hope whoever it is that takes care of Dr.Seuss' estate and actually approved this movie being made and released ends up in the fiery depths of hell.,0
"I didn't think it would be possible for anyone to rip the heart out of a Dr. Seuss book...and just when you didn't think it was possible, along came Hollywood.",1
"Yeah folks, I feel violated.",0
Don't let this happen to you.,1
Just go see Elf with Will Ferrell instead.,0
"Synopsis: Sally and Conrad learn to set limits on their misadventure, with a little help from Dr Seuss' ( Theodor S. Geisel ) Cat in the Hat ( 1957 ).",0
"Analysis: There may not be many things that I'm sure of, but I do know a few for absolute certain.",1
"Leg-warmers will never make a come-back, DavidK93 IS gay, JackSommersby is NOT gay, and the world would be a much better place if every adult and child read ( and understood ) Dr. Seuss' books.",1
"In fact, referring to them as children's literature is a misnomer.",0
"There's not a single example of Seussian literature that fails to transcend any preconceived notion of what it means to be young, old or somewhere in the middle.",1
All the Places You'll Go has helped through many a difficult transition.,0
I've vowed never to live through a holiday season when I don't watch the animated How the Grinch Stole Christmas!,1
( 1966 ) at least a dozen times.,0
I've even prepared green eggs and ham on a date (you could say that I ate them with a fox ).,0
"So, yes, I always have been and forever will be a Dr. Suess fanatic.",0
"If he were still alive today, I might even have stalkerish tendencies.",0
"But this review isn't about my clearly irrational desire to live in the world of Dr. Suess, it's about how Bo Welch's ( henceforth referred to as Bo Grinch ) cinematic adaptation of Seuss' Cat in the Hat has robbed me of my childhood memories.",1
I'll begin with the only element of Cat in the Hat that I found acceptable -- the Seussian visuals.,0
"Flip through any Seuss book and you'll find some of the most colorful, creative and inspiring illustrations that exist.",0
"Seuss never saw any reason not to redraw that which already exists, and neither did Bo Grinch.",1
"Through a nice combination of animation and set-design, Seussian architecture lives on.",0
"The design team had fun with the landscape, the houses, the trees, the cars, and everything under the sun ( although, surprisingly, nothing above the sun ).",0
This creative re-engineering draws the viewer ( or reader ) into a parallel universe where age-old lessons can be taught or re-taught without the obstructions created in the minds of this one.,1
"Drawing things as they've never been drawn has also helped to maintain the timeless nature of Seuss' work, and avoids the pitfalls of stereotypes and geographic isolation.",1
But this is where the film turns from Seussian into a a blueprint for disaster.,0
The illustration is just one element in the greater scheme.,0
"To think of Dr. Seuss' work as mere pictures, rhymes and morals is to insult his legacy.",0
"Dr. Seuss was a creative visionary who never set any limits on imagination, and this is where Cat in the Hat fails to live-up to expectations.",1
Bo Grinch has obviously lived inside a box for his entire life.,0
"He compromises on everything that made Dr. Seuss great in order to make a few ( billion ) bucks, and squanders every opportunity to build on greatness.",0
"I have no problem with people that value money above all else, but please limit your destruction to that which is yours.",1
"The rights to Seuss' words might be yours, but his legacy is not!",1
"He tries feebly to introduce new characters ( Mr. Humberfloob, Quinn ) and expand on old ones, but these fall far short of expectations.",0
The liberties taken with the story mortalize a once timeless tale.,0
The most difficult hurdle to overcome was turning a story that is slightly longer than this review into a 1 hour and 15 minute feature length film.,0
"This leads to Bo Grinch's biggest mistake, allowing Mike Myers to run willy-nilly through the minds and hearts of the audience in the guise of the Cat in the Hat.",0
"It seemed to me that Myers forgot that he isn't on Saturday Night Live, playing to a largely adult audience.",1
"I kept wondering when he was going to be verklempt, and half expected his coos of"" Wowwoo!"" to be followed by"" Wayne's World!",0
Wayne's World!,0
"Party Time! Excellent!""",0
"Indeed, Mike Myers recycled his entire CV of SNL characters to create a Cat in the Hat that is unworthy of his name.",0
"I've long admired Mike Myers, and appreciate much of his work.",0
This simply wasn't the venue for him to enlist his own brand of creative devices.,1
"Sean Hayes shines through the rest of cast, but only in one of his roles.",0
"I found him entirely unconvincing as Mr. Humberfloob, the mother's slave-driving germaphobe of a boss.",0
"As the fish, he's wonderful.",0
"For a character whose sole purpose is to antagonize the Cat in the Hat, he is surprisingly tolerable.",0
"I think Alec Baldwin ( Quinn ) and Kelly Preston ( Mom ) do an adequate job, but I feel that their romantic relationship and the undercurrents of jealousy that come with it are entirely inappropriate for the story.",0
"Spencer Breslin ( Conrad ) and Dakota Fanning ( Sally ) are just children themselves, and can't be held responsible for the awkwardness that is brought about by Bo Grinch and his grinchy ways.",1
( I also have to agree with flamepillar's assessment that the Things are unnecessarily creepy ),0
"It's the potty humor, though, that I find the most offensive.",0
"( Yes, I realize that I'm the same person who's always saying there isn't enough nudity, but even I ascribe to some sense of good taste ) The references to a dirty hoe and a Playboy centerfold were entirely unnecessary.",1
"I realize that younger children might not get them, but then WHY include them?",1
"Adults have never found this necessary to enjoy Seuss' books; and spoiling the pristine, although sometimes misunderstood, image of the Cat in the Hat is a low blow -- even for Mike Myers.",1
"Final Comments: I've droned on for far too long about a film that can be summed up in one ( of many ) four letter words ( s ), Suck.",0
"Cat in the Hat is an abomination, which should be watched at the peril of your childhood.",0
I never even got to see what it would be like to fly a kite in the house.,1
I never got to see the Things bump the kites on the wall!,1
And we did not like it.,1
Not one little bit.,1
"I realize that I love to rant and rave, but here are a few well-respected concurring opinions: anderclayton, kristinafh, flamepillar.",0
"Ok, not everyone agrees with me: dragonfire88, Bruguru.",1
Plot Details: This opinion reveals no details about the movie's plot.,0
"This review is based on my own opinion as a family man and father of three boys, ages 4, 8 and 11.",0
I consider myself a moderate person that is not overly protective or overly liberal.,1
I believe parents are responsible to find a balance in making our kids aware of reality while at the same time protecting them ( and their innocence ) from it.,0
I love Dr. Seuss stories.,0
I grew up reading his books and still enjoy reading them to my sons.,0
Shame on me for not checking the rating before taking the kids to the theater.,0
I had assumed ( like I'm sure many of you would ) that it would be rated G. It's not.,1
I think this rendition of the story would make Dr. Seuss roll over in his grave.,0
"The movie is absent 4-letter words and explicit sex scenes, but the inappropriate-for-children content and mature innuendos in this movie overshadow the story line and plot.",0
"There were enough instances that I cannot recall all of them, but multiple times during the movie I felt uncomfortable wondering if any of my three sons understood the inappropriate jokes.",1
"I later discovered my 11 year old understood all of them ( I wish he hadn't ), my 8 year old understood about 1/2 of them, and my 4 year old is still innocent enough to understood none of them ( except the""butt scene"" ).",1
"The most memorable moments that I did not appreciate are the""butt scene"" - where the cat was outfitted with a large bare bottom, using the term"" Dirty Ho"" - referring to a dirty gardening hoe, and an acronym for the cat's vehicle is S.H.I.T.",1
This story is written more for parents who are Mike Meyers fans more than it is for small children.,0
"It is full of funny faces, personality shifts, and one-liners that are classic Meyers.",0
Kids like the quick transition and can relate to the main characters who are a boy and girl.,0
The story line and plot itself is poor and doesn't flow nearly as smooth as a Dr. Seuss's classic should.,1
"This rendition pales in contrast to the other Seuss classic that was released in recent years,"" The Grinch"".",0
"In all fairness, my children enjoyed the movie.",0
"As an added bonus, my 8 year old said"" Dirty Ho"" for the first time and thanks to his older brother, now understands it too.",0
"This movie will leave you wanting more... of NEMO, that is.",0
"I WOULD NOT SEE THIS HERE OR THERE, I WOULD NOT SEE THIS AGAIN ANYWHERE...",1
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
I grew up reading Dr. Seuss.,0
"Green Eggs and Ham, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and The Cat in the Hat were some of my favorite books.",0
"When Ron Howard directed How the Grinch Stole Christmas back in 2000, I was so excited.",0
It was like seeing a childhood fantasy coming to life with Whoville and everything.,0
That movie was so excellent.,0
"It was true to the original story and the acting, special effects, costumes, everything was incredible.",0
It was like a page from the book.,0
"When Bo Welch decided to direct a movie version of The Cat in the Hat, I was equally excited.",0
"I guess I just thought that this movie would be as good as the Grinch, but unfortunately, it wasn't.",1
This movie does not even come close to being half as good as How the Grinch Stole Christmas was.,1
"In fact, it was just one big disappointment from the start.",0
Mike Myers stars as that lovable Cat who comes to make trouble while Sally ( Dakota Fanning ) and Conrad's ( Spencer Breslin ) mother ( Kelly Preston ) is out.,0
"Their mom is at work under pressure from her boss Mr. Humberfloob ( Sean Hayes, who created the voice of the Fish ) to throw a perfect dinner party that night; otherwise, she will be F-I-R-E-D.",0
"When she receives a call that Conrad and Sally are causing trouble, she must make a quick trip home where the audience is then introduced to her boyfriend and neighbor, Quinn ( Alec Baldwin ).",0
Quinn has secret designs to send Conrad to military school and the kids must therefore find some way to expose him before their mom decides to get married.,0
Enter Mrs. Kwan ( Amy Hill ): the babysitter who loves to sleep.,0
"It starts raining, Conrad and Sally have been fighting, they hear a loud noise, go to see what it is, and discover an oversized cat.",0
Cat promises them a fun-filled day where nothing will go wrong; he even has them sign a contract.,0
"Little do Conrad and Sally know that Cat will only create many more problems for them with the use of his mysterious hat, including making their fish talk, destroying their house, and basically ruining their lives.",0
"But of course, every Dr. Seuss story has its moral and its happy ending.",0
Conrad and Sally learn that they really love each other and should cooperate more with their mom.,0
It's not the acting that makes this movie bad.,1
"In fact, the acting is the only saving grace of this film.",0
"Alec Baldwin is perfect as the nosy, two-faced neighbor who only has designs on Conrad and Sally's mom.",0
"The way he seems so sweet one minute and like the biggest villain the next, will have you loving him one minute and hating him the next.",0
Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin are both precious as the bickering sister and brother.,0
Sally doesn't know how to have fun and Conrad only knows how to have fun.,1
They are at the two extremes of the fun scale and have to find their way to the middle.,0
Mike Myers is perfect as Cat.,0
He's hilarious.,0
There is just something about the way he says his lines that makes them so funny.,0
It's just everything else about the film that is wrong.,0
"First, I'll start with the screenplay.",0
This is such a classic children's book and yet Alec Berg's screenplay demolishes it.,0
The movie changed things that were in the book and added some stuff that was never in there to begin with and didn't help the movie.,1
I especially didn't like the fact that there seem to be a couple of sexual innuendos unappropriate for children and completely unnecessary in the film.,1
The make-up wasn't too good either.,1
The costume and make-up of Cat look so fake that it's not even funny.,1
"I know that it would be rather difficult to do make-up to make Mike Myers look like a cat, but honestly, they could have done a little bit better than they did.",0
"The Grinch was a completely fake creature, yet Jim Carrey looked perfect in that movie.",0
The setting wasn't exactly what I had envisioned either.,1
"It didn't look like it had just""leapt"" out of the book.",1
"Overall, I think little kids will like the movie.",0
They won't know any different.,1
Adults and anyone who has ever read the book won't be that impressed.,1
"I would highly recommend a different movie, such as Elf, if you're looking for a family movie that everyone will love.",0
"Wait to get this movie for the kids when it comes out on video, it's not really worth seeing in theaters.",1
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot.,0
"OK, I'll admit it, I went to this movie with pretty low expectations, and they seemed to meet everyone of them.",0
I have been a Dr Seuss fan since I first loved to read.,0
"Now I have two kids of my own and when the kids bring me a Dr Seuss book to read at bed time, I have as much fun reading it as they do hearing it.",0
WARNING!!!,0
"This gets long winded and I apologize for it, but there is so much to complain about.",0
Overall Problems ( in my opinion ):,0
The Cat: Apparently the only thing Mike Myers had to base his character on was old copies of the Wizard of Oz.,0
The cat looked too much like the lion AND laughed too much like the lion AND often sounded too much like the lion.,0
"I never met the Doc, but I have to believe after reading as much as I have of his material, the cat he had in mind was not a vulgar pervert with bad taste in music.",1
"I really thought for this part, someone would have put a leash on Mike Myers.",0
The Language:,0
"While they never actually said any curse words, They got way too close on several occasions.",1
"Based on the load at the theatre I was at, and the fact that it's been on for about 5 days now, I'd guess that approx 1000 kids are going to be walking around school looking at one another and quoting the cat when he said"" SON OF A BI..."", never actually saying it, but getting to close.",1
"Lots of kids will be saying with no understanding of what it was meant to imply, but would you want them to walk up in front of your parents, their teacher, someone at church, or someone in a store and spout off that phrase??",1
It was one of many.,0
"There is another scene where the boy starts to say SH** ( as a lady I used to work with would say..."" Sugar-Honey-Iced-Tea"" ).",0
"I think if this was going to be marketed to kids, Mike and the producers could have done a lot of house cleaning in this area.",0
Alec Baldwin:,0
"Although it was a bit confusing to my 4 year old why Mr. Conductor from the Thomas the Tank movie was in the Cat In The Hat, Alec's character did a good job of being the guy any kid could hate.",0
He taunts the boy to the point that you just want to see this kid really give him what's coming to him.,0
What I didn't like was the over the top job they did on Alec's character making him the opposite of what the children's mother thought he was.,1
"We comes through the kitchen at one point carrying a 6 pack of beer, eating a sandwich, and burps in the kids faces.",0
"Then another scene shows home removing what looks like the""girdle"" that surgery patients wear on their abdomen to prevent tearing the stitches.",0
A LARGE gut comes rolling out and he proceeds to sit there being as gross as possible.,0
"The good points (ok, this should be quick )",0
"Kelly Preston: If I really have to explain why she is in the""good"" section, then you haven't seen her.",1
( big grin ),0
The Story Line:,0
"OK, I'll give credit here, although I really didn't like the path they took to get there, the story line was basically the same.",1
"Fun is good, but only if you know when to stop.",0
Some added touches...,0
"The brother and sister who had issues before the adventure, were now a lot closer and even willing to stand up for one another.",0
"The mother who was starting to doubt not only her ability to raise her son, but also her son's ability to accept responsibility and do the things we was asked to do, now had now doubt that they would all be just fine together.",1
Did I mention Kelly Preston yet??,0
"Overall, this would be an ok movie for older kids, maybe, if they had a firm grasp on the understanding that some of the things you see on a movie are not acceptable in the real world.",1
It would probably be a good teenager movie.,0
It seemed to have a lot of the type of humor teens are accustomed to seeing.,0
"( not saying that's good or bad, just that this movie wouldn't be their first exposure to this type of humor ).",1
"Imagine if you will, Mike Myers dressing the part of the Lion from the Wizard of OZ, and filming the next installment of Austin Powers dressed that way through the whole movie.",0
"If you haven't figured it out by now, I wasn't real impressed with this movie.",1
"Being a long time Doc fan, I didn't like the Grinch with Jim Carey, but it was a masterpiece compared to this one.",1
I really hope that Horton Hear A Who isn't up for the next book to be butchered.,1
Poor Dr. Seuss.,0
"I'm not sure if he should be angrier at his widow for giving studios the rights to his stories, or to the studios for stabbing his widow in the back when she trusted them.",1
"When THE GRINCH was made, it was a fun movie that could have been pushed further.",0
But it was fun.,0
I understand that the widow has control over what is going on during the writing process.,0
"In THE GRINCH she exercised a lot of, but not enough, control.",1
"In THE CAT IN THE HAT, the producers and writers took the rights they had and ran with them, putting things in that the widow, let alone Dr. Seuss, didn't and wouldn't have endorsed.",1
"Whether you loved or hated THE GRINCH, it's the Sistine Chapel compared to this monstrosity.",0
We have a cliched story.,0
"The little girl, Sally, is a control freak.",0
"Her brother, Conrad, seems to make it his life mission to get into trouble.",0
"The babysitter comes to watch the children, and she falls asleep.",0
Enter the Cat.,0
"The movie, which starts out almost promisingly, loses its grip as soon as the Cat enters.",0
"Funny, but I thought for sure it should pick up there, if anything.",0
"All day, the cat insists on doing outlandish things with the children, such as making cupcakes out of, literally, everything, and using the sleeping babysitter as a raft while going down a water slide.",0
"A lame and cliched subplot, about the mother's boyfriend wanting to send Conrad to military school, also takes place.",0
One sexual joke after another follows.,0
"The cat lands on a garden hoe and exclaims"" You dirty ho! Oh, just kidding.",0
"I love you, baby!""",0
"When asked where he came from, the cat starts to explain"" Well, when a mommy cat and a daddy cat love each other very much..."" The most appalling sexual joke is when the cat's hat stiffens, like an erection, when he's looking at a picture of the kids' mother and asks"" Who is that?""",0
It turns out the picture of her is constructed like a Playboy centerfold.,0
"And, of course, since Mike Meyers plays the Cat, it seems he is obligated to reference Austin Powers.",0
"Heck, the movie is one un-funny comedy sketch after another by Mike Meyers.",0
"To quote one critic,"" It is difficult to tell who is less recognizable in this movie-- The Cat or Mike Meyers.""",0
I think the cat.,0
"A cute, innocent story ( though some Freudians will argue that it's not such ) was taken and butchered by writers who feel that the only way to make this story work is to appeal to the lowest common denominator.",1
"If that's the case, then why even make this movie?",0
"You wind up not disliking, but hating, all the characters in the movie.",1
"This movie is allegedly for kids, but I do not think it's suitable for most kids under 10.",1
"I know that, even at 11, I would have been disturbed by the sexual jokes in it, had I understood them.",0
"Hopefully, the silver lining around this mushroom cloud will be that kids have a new appreciation for the book and television special.",0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot.,0
This is the first movie I have given an F to all year.,0
"I'm sure there are other F movies, but I try to avoid seeing those.",0
When I read all the bad reviews I was in denial.,0
"My 7 year old daughter wanted to see it, so I gave it a shot.",0
"I am a Michael Myer fan and although"" The Grinch"" was not all that great, I found it watchable.",1
"What I got was a shameless commercial, plugging the soundtrack, the cat in the hat merchandise and UNIVERSAL STUDIOS!!!",0
"I couldn't believe it, I was insulted.",0
This movie has no value whatsoever.,1
The story is non existent and Micheal Myers ( whom I usually enjoy ) compresses every character he's ever played into one big hairy annoying one.,1
"He even uses his"" Fat Bastard"" voice from Austin Powers.",0
"The visuals were good, Ill give it that.",0
The colors and sets were Dr.Suessish.,0
"DOES ANYONE REMEMBER CAT IN THE HAT yelling"" Bit*h"" or getting hit in the privates with a bat.",0
Or...referencing a dirty ho while holding a garden tool.,0
Or belching....or showing his buttcrack!!!!!,0
A dog even pees on someones food.,0
If this is what Hollywood thinks is quality childrens entertainment...they are mistaken.,0
Very innapropriate for children.,0
"It definitely takes a parent off guard to take their child to see, what you think will be a quality childrens movie, and get this terrible film.",0
OK..OK...OK....now that I got that out of my system.,0
Cat in the Hat is about 2 children living with there single mother.,0
"The young boy is a trouble maker, always getting into mischief and wrecking the house.",0
The girl is like a 30 year old trapped in a 6 year old body.,0
The mother is the typical workaholic mom who has no time for discipline.,1
She is dating the neighbor man played by Alec Baldwin.,0
"He seems like a successful businessman, but behind closed doors, he's a drunken slob.",0
"Then as the mother goes off to work, the Cat in the Hat shows up to show these two kids how to have some fun.",0
Thats about all the lot there is.,0
"The neighbor man tries to bust the kids, but of course he only makes himself look silly.",0
If you'd like to know anything else...please see the top of my review.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals no details about the movie's plot.,1
The movie is overwrought and overdone.,0
The plot is not the books.,1
"I know that movies are not supposed to be fully like the book but when practically every child ( as well as adult ) in America has read the Dr. Seuss books, this is unforgivable.",0
"The movies dont need to be fleshed out with over analytical information about why the Cat is who he is or with the history of their lives, but give it a rest.",1
The good stuff.the,0
visual production itself with its ultra-stylized appearance.,0
"It looks nice, but did the budget of a third world nation need to be spent to create this film?",0
The plot has added a bunch of new things to itand who cares.,0
This is a short book which should have remained a cartoon classic on tv.,0
"With the holidays upon us and the mass merchandising, the movie is sure to be a hittoo bad as there are some other films that deserve to be seen.",0
"At less than 90 minutes, this movie is definitely too long.",0
Youll probably have screaming kids who want to see this film.it is on steroids the way it runs all over the place but they may be entertained.,0
Parents have two choices: lie and say the theatre went out of business.,0
Or give in to the children and put up with their disappointment.,0
Stale popcorn would be better than this movie.,0
Somehow I think this movie will be better on video as seeing it on the smaller screen may make it appear to be less over produced.,0
I am a bit familiar with the works of Dr. Seuss.,0
The way his books have hit the big screen constitutes child abuse.,0
Seuss was expert in how to write for children.,0
The people who adapt his work to the big screen seem to have no clue what it's like to be a child.,1
"Neither does The Cat ( Mike Myers ) in the live-action version of"" The Cat In The Hat."" Plot When he comes to the Walden residence, he scares young Sally ( Dakota Fanning ) and Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ).",1
"Their mother, realtor Joan Walden ( Kelly Preston ) has to report for work for her obsessive-compulsive boss, Hank Humberfloob ( Sean Hayes ), even though she has to host a work-related party at her house that night.",0
"Meanwhile, Joan's boyfriend, Lawrence Quinn ( Alec Baldwin ), encourages Joan to send Conrad, who's the unruly child, to military school.",0
"If her children are unruly, or the party fails in any other way, Hank promises Joan that she will lose her job.",0
"Joan calls on Mrs. Kwan ( Amy Hill ) to babysit her kids, and she promptly falls asleep.",0
"The Cat then proceeds to turn the house into a mess, with a little help from Thing 1 and Thing 2. The presence of The Cat throws the family fish (voiced by Hayes ) into a state of hysteria.",0
"The mess catches Lawrence's attention, and he heads to Joan's workplace to snitch on Sally and Conrad.",0
"When The Cat unleashes the Things from their crate, the family dog gets a hold of the lock.",0
They have to retrieve the lock before the residence becomes a total wreck.,0
They also have to head into town to thwart Lawrence.,0
"The Things create a diversion for Joan, while The Cat and the kids try to return everything to normal.",0
""" The Cat In The Hat"" is mean-spirited toward the kids, and is even more mean-spirited toward the adults.",0
The Walden children are surrounded by people who should never be their role models.,1
Not one adult comes across as a sympathetic character.,1
"Joan should know better about Mrs. Kwan's propensity for napping, and Lawrence and Hank are absolutely obnoxious and selfish.",0
The adults are not the least bit appealing.,1
"As for Myers, he has no chemistry with Fanning or Breslin, who are the best parts of this movie.",1
"He comes to the home not as the spirit of fun, but as the spirit of a stand-up comic.",1
"In fact, Myers changes his voice so many times, he seems like he's playing Robin Williams playing The Cat.",0
"The voice he adopts most often, though, sounds like Myers's Linda Richman character from"" Saturday Night Live.""",0
"In fact, The Cat often uses skits to entertain, such as using an infomercial to get Sally and Conrad to get a device guaranteed to create a mess.",0
He even needs a gadget to see what sort of fun is needed.,0
The Cat should know this instinctively.,0
"The low point, though, comes when Sally, Conrad, and The Cat are on a slide, and Myers turns toward the camera and makes a shameless plug for the Universal Studios theme park.",0
This feline doesn't show Sally and Conrad how to have fun; he shows them how to be consumers.,1
""" The Cat In The Hat"" marks the feature film debut of Bo Welch, best known in Hollywood as a production designer.",0
"The community in the film looks like a live variation of Seuss's vision, but that's about all that's faithful to his work.",0
This film has no direction; it's just a series of skits that just barely run long enough to constitute a feature-length film.,1
There's exactly one funny moment in this poor excuse for a movie.,0
"When The Cat first enters, he finds a coat hanger, puts Mrs. Kwan on it, and throws her in the closet.",0
""" The Cat In The Hat"" otherwise does not have any true sense of playfulness.",1
The only ones who are playful at all are Fanning and Breslin.,0
It's fun to watch Conrad try and convince the prim and proper Sally to bounce on their mother's couch.,0
"Unfortunately, they're the only ones who seem to understand what they're supposed to be doing.",0
"I get the feeling that if somebody had let these children direct the movie, they would have done better than Welch.",0
"I said this when the live-action"" How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" was released, and I'll say it again here.",0
"Don't introduce children to the work of Dr. Seuss with the live-action"" The Cat In The Hat."" Read the books to them, or let them read the books to you.",0
Catch up to the animated features Seuss and Chuck Jones helped to create.,0
"Mike Myers can claim he played The Cat In The Hat, but in reality, all he is is a pale imitation of a beloved children's character.",0
"Poor Dr. Seuss', he must be rolling in his grave.",0
"This movie stank, stunk, stinks... Mike Myers is a twit that obviously was suffering severely from being in that costume.",0
"His acting stank, stunk, stinks.",0
"This movie is NOT for young children, which is rather disappointing because thats who would have watched the movie had it been any good.",1
"Kids were asking their parents to leave, and parents were asking falling asleep during the flick.",0
"Sure the special effects were neat, I guess, if you are into those types of things.",0
The jokes were not that funny.,1
It was NOT worth the money paid.,1
I should have waited until it came out on video and rented it for.99 cents.,0
Better yet waited a few years until they played it on some hacked up cable channel.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.,0
"Often touted as Americas Sweetheart, Julia Roberts has made some nice, lighthearted films like Pretty Woman, Steel Magnolias, Notting Hill, My Best Friends Wedding  and her Oscar-winning role in Erin Brokovich.",0
"Since winning the Oscar for Best Actress, Roberts went on a detour to experiment more as an actress, notably with independent filmmaker Steven Soderbergh, who she worked on Erin Brokovich  for films like Oceans Eleven, Full Frontal, and George Clooneys directorial debut for Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.",0
Some wonder if Roberts  experiment would be a detour from Hollywood but she decided to return to her leading lady status for the all-prep school drama Mona Lisa Smile.,0
"Mona Lisa Smile  is about a 1953 subversive art teacher from UCLA who goes to the east coast, All-women School of Wellesley College to teach a group of overachieving students to find alternatives to marriage.",0
"Along the way, she has to endure the rigid, conservatism of the school, its students, and the faade society that is the 1950s.",0
"Directed by Mike Newell and written by the team of Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal, Mona Lisa Smile  might seem like the female version of Peter Weirs 1989 masterpiece Dead Poets Society.",0
"Apparently, it is nt nor should it even be compared to Dead Poets Society.",1
"Hailed as one of the most anticipated films of 2003, Mona Lisa Smile  comes off as a bland, mediocre mesh of a film that leaves too many unanswered questions and contrived messages.",0
"Not even the films young cast of Kirsten Dunst, Ginnifer Goodwin, Julia Stiles, and Maggie Gyllenhaal along with Dominic West, John Slattery, and Marcia Gay Harden could save this disappointment called Mona Lisa Smile.",1
"The film begins when former UCLA teacher Katherine Watson ( Julia Roberts ) who arrives at the station for Wellesley College, an all-womens school in Massachusetts where shes been hired to teach in the art department for its students.",0
"Watson meets up with staff and lives in the house with fellow teacher, Nancy Abbey ( Marcia Gay Harden ) who has an affixation with TV show  I Love Lucy.",0
"On Watsons first day, she meets up with her class to show them slides of paintings and every student identify the painting as such like robots and Watson finds herself being challenged.",0
She talks to Nancy and school nurse Amanda Armstrong ( Juliet Stevenson ) about the first day saying it was fine.,0
"The next day, Watson gives paintings that werent in the required syllabus for the students that leads to the schools news editor Betty Warren ( Kirsten Dunst ) to saying the painting is appalling since it has no structure or textures.",1
Fellow classmates Constance Baker ( Ginnifer Goodwin ) and Giselle Levy ( Maggie Gyllenhaal ) however find something different about as Giselle considered it aggressive and erotic.,0
Betty is nt fond of Watsons subversive tactics although the rest of her classmates including valedictorian Joan Brandwyn ( Julia Stiles ) find them refreshing.,1
"Giselle however, thinks Watson is great as she plays around a lot carrying a diaphragm around her that she got from the school nurse.",0
"Betty, being the snitch, writes about Armstrong giving out contraceptives that forced to be fired by the schools rigid, conservative president Jocelyn Carr ( Marian Seldes ).",0
Katherine finds herself in a dangerous position wondering if she should continue to challenge the system while finding a bit of sympathy from the schools Italian professor Bill Dunbar ( Dominic West ).,0
"When Katherine was grading papers, she meets up with Joan who questioned her grade as Katherine just wants her to state her own opinion and not someone elses.",1
"Katherine asks what Joan plans to do, after marriage since shes already signed up for pre-law.",0
Katherine suggests she should go to Yale.,0
"One event the school is anticipating is Bettys wedding to an important young named Spencer Jones ( Jordan Bridges ) as the whole school attends and it becomes some event as Giselle continues to flirt with Dunbar, whom she had an affair with in the summer.",0
Joan and her boyfriend Tommy Donegal ( Topher Grace ) would visit Betty and Spencer on one occasion as she tells Betty that shes thinking of going to Yale Law School to Bettys utter disgust.,0
"Katherine meanwhile, is trying to teach the class more about art.",0
"Not to appreciate but look beneath the paintings, notably Jackson Pollock.",1
"The students find themselves more comfortable, including Constance who always gets some sort of bad criticism from Betty.",0
"Constance finds herself more at comfort whenever Betty is nt around, especially when pursuing aspiring writer Charlie Stewart ( Ebon Moss-Bacharach ).",1
"When Betty returns from her honeymoon, she tries to make horrible comments towards Watsons abrasive tactics but Watson refuses.",0
"During the holidays, Katherine receives a visit from her boyfriend Paul Moore ( John Slattery ) who tries to propose to her but she finds herself uncomfortable, especially in the presence of Dunbar and Giselle.",0
"Joan meanwhile, is questioning on what she wants since she loves Tommy but also wants to be a lawyer.",0
Katherine breaks up with Paul and finds herself more becoming closer to Dunbar.,0
Dunbars newfound relationship with Watson leaves Giselle to be a bit more desperate as she tries to find a new affair.,0
"After a party where Katherine revealed that she was once engaged but never made it to the altar, Betty goes into another rant over Katherines life and finds herself alienated by the rest of the student.",1
"Betty becomes a thorn to some students, notably the insecure Constance as she tells her that Charlie had been going out with someone, which turned out not to be true as Betty finds her marriage crumbling.",1
The political aspect of the school grows tense when the board question what Katherine has been doing.,0
The students began to ponder their own direction in life including Betty as Katherine is wondering if she should stay without any sense of compromise.,1
What makes Mona Lisa Smile  such a disappointing film in many levels is rooted in its script.,0
"The script leaves too many plot holes about why is Katherine being subversive, what emotional reasons is Giselle having for these affairs, why the school is trying to be protective of new things, and why is this script such a mess?",0
"Then again, this is what should be expected from the likes of Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal since they wrote such awful films like the Planet of the Apes  and Mighty Joe Young  remakes.",0
"They leave too many characters with unanswered questions, rigid stereotypes ( in the male roles ), generic film clichs including a very bland ending that leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth, and contrived messages that might upset the hardcore feminists.",0
"Director Mike Newell, known for his great work in Enchanted April  and Donnie Brasco does a somewhat, mediocre job although he can capture great dramatic moments, he does nt give anyone the idea on what type of film this should be.",1
"Should this be a drama, a comedy, a thinking film, what?",0
"The film has no true, linear structure and leaves everything in a very disappointing way.",1
Newell still should be given credit for trying to make things interesting since the pacing of the film is attentive but it s given a weak script with no sense of a singular direction to begin with.,1
What was the point of this film?,0
"I know women in the 1950s played these rigid, housewife roles that have a nice image but I doubt there was any sense of extreme until the Beat movement later in that decade.",0
"I know women were the core audience of this film, particularly young college women.",0
"Yes, it s all right with women to be married and to have a career.",0
I dont have a problem with.,1
"I just dont like it presented in this bland, contrived form.",1
"One of the few positives of the film is the cinematography by Anastas N. Michos, that has lovely moments of colorful images and that authentic 1950s look.",0
Even the production and costume designs are well used.,0
"Since the film was a period piece of sorts, you have to have that authentic look and back-in-time feel.",0
"While the cinematography, art direction, production designs, and costumes design should be noted, it still does nt have the freshness of what to expect for a film made for the Oscars, which is one huge reason why this film was made.",1
Another noted factor but in a very poor way was the score by Rachel Portman.,0
"Even in the tense, dramatic moments, it does nt feel suspenseful nor in the lighter moments, it comes out as fluff.",1
"Julia Roberts without a doubt, is a good actress depending on what film she does.",1
"Unfortunately in period pieces like Mary Reilly  and Michael Collins, she has never fared well and in Mona Lisa Smile, she does nt really bring anything that we have nt seen before.",1
"Sure, her smile will make you go to the theaters but does it help the film.",0
"While she showed some masterful parts in the dramatic scenes and having some nice chemistry with Marcia Gay Harden, she does nt carry spark when it comes to the romantic scenes with Dominic West, which felt too fast and very clichd.",1
"Wests character, like most of the male characters, is written in a very stereotypical way.",0
Wests Bill Dunbar is served as this lothario who is nt quite as he seems and it s a very clichd character and Wests performance is mediocre at best.,1
The rest of the male performances from Topher Grace and Jordan Bridges are also clichd although Grace does bring in some charm into his performance while Bridges just stands there and look good next to Kirsten Dunst.,0
John Slatterys role as Roberts boyfriend was so underused and was left very early after she dumps him and he seemed like a good guy and it was a waste for Slattery.,0
The best male performance goes to Ebon Moss-Bacharach as the nerd-like Charlie Stewart since he has a charm and his performance even surpasses the clich his character is written and the scenes he has with Ginnifer Goodwin were nice to watch.,0
"While the smaller performances of Juliet Stevenson, Marian Seldes, and Donna Mitchell as Dunsts mother were used to a good degree despite their clichs while Mitchells character as this mean, controlling mother was a little too much.",0
Kirsten Dunsts performance as the b*tchy Betty Warren at times is convincing since you dont like her but you dont really sympathize with her character very much at all and she comes out very shrilly.,1
"Even when she strays from her mother and conservative views, her development is way too fast and it ends up becoming a very mediocre performance.",0
"Julia Stiles  performance I found to be the most confusing because half the time, shes speaking in an English, New English, or a straightforward American accent.",0
"It was very messy and her character was just totally generic, I did nt really care for her.",1
The films best performance for me goes to Ginnifer Goodwin as Constance since she was someone to sympathize with since she is nt the prettiest of the whole group but Goodwin plays her performance with a lot of heart.,1
Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers an excellent performance although she is not the scene-stealer many are saying.,1
"Although I enjoyed her character in the film since she kind of played the big-sister role for other characters as well as being flirtatious, I felt the character was underwritten.",0
"In the films site, they say she is fragile and all of this junk yet I never found out why she sleeps with these men or anything.",1
"It was very confusing to be quite honest with although Gyllenhaal, to her credit stood out on her own.",0
Marcia Gay Harden is the films most hilarious performance since she tries to teach the women how to please your husbands while having some sadness that she tries to hide through her humor.,0
"Harden, deserves a lot of credit for bringing him some much needed humor to the rigid, melodrama the film was going under.",0
"Overall, Mona Lisa Smile  is just a huge disappointing effort from Mike Newell despite some noteworthy performances from Marcia Gay Harden, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Ginnifer Goodwin.",0
"It was very clear from the start this film was made to get some attention for the Oscars but after the recent snub from the Golden Globes ( except for Best Original Song for Elton John, which is an all right song ); it s likely not to get any Oscar nominations for anyone involved except the costume and production designs.",1
Fans of Julia Roberts might enjoy this although they might expect more from her as an actress instead of the name people know.,0
Fans of Gyllenhaal should best stay away from this film although she does a good performance.,0
Mona Lisa Smile  is really a film for fans of Julia Roberts although many fans would feel it couldve been much better in the end.,0
This is the worst movie I have seen in recent memory.,0
"A lot of people say,"" This is a movie for kids, not adults, so don't be so harsh.""",1
But even my kids ( 10 and 14 ) disliked it.,0
"It was"" Austin Powers Does Dr. Seuss.""",0
"It was so bad, I can't even think of a way to make fun of it.",1
The jokes were tired and WAY overdone.,0
The attempts to insert humor for the parents was just painful and out of place.,0
"Despite what some people think, a kids movie can be good and appeal to adults, such as Toy Story or Space Jam.",0
"My wife is very forgiving when it comes to bad movies, and even she said she wouldn't be buying this one for our video library.",0
What a truly awful adaptation from such a wonderful children's classic.,0
So much could have been done with this classic story.,0
"Instead, the result is major disappointment, a poor attempt to mimic The Grinch ( which worked ) and other movies of this genre.",0
"Myers is a fish out of water, trying hard to liven-up an otherwise dreadful script and story line, and pandering to adults with""oh-so-current"" references and innuendo.",0
The mean-spirited character over-played by Alec Baldwin is enough to give nightmares to children familiar with his role as the benevolent Mr. Conductor in the Thomas the Tank Engine movie.,0
Kelly Preston is gorgeous.,0
"I was insulted every time the two disturbed children were forced by the Director to""look at the camera, show astonishment, look at each other, then look back at the camera"".",0
What a tremendous lost opportunity,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
"One of these days I'm going to learn that ghost movies just don't scare me like they used to, and I should stop wasting my time on them in the theatres.",0
"I'm not sure if I just got over them, or if it's just because they are all the same.",0
"The Ring creeped me out, but lost me towards the end.",0
"Gothika was like a bad combination of several other movies, and I have yet to place what ones they were.",0
"Girl Interupted and The Ring, as well as Don't Say a Word are the first to pop into my mind, with slight residues of House on Haunted Hill and maybe even a little bit of The Sixth Sense",0
"Gothika is about Miranda Grey, a psychologist at a prison for women.",0
"The movie starts with a session with Chloe ( Penelope Cruz ), a woman who had been raped by her stepfather and who had killed him.",0
"She is obviously quite disturbed, she keeps referring to the devil as the one who rapes her.",0
"The session ends with her being dragged out of the room, kicking and screaming.",0
Dr. Grey obviously doesn't believe her.,1
"On her way home from work that evening, Dr. Grey is presented with a detour due to a sinkhole created by a rainstorm.",0
The darkness and the pounding rain set the stage for what is about to happen next.,0
"She is crossing a covered bridge, and when she emerges at the other end, there is a girl standing there, in her nightgown, right in the middle of the road.",0
"She swerves, barely misses her, and goes into the ditch.",0
"Dr. Grey gets out of her car, limping, and confronts the girl, who is shaken and scared looking.",0
"The girl has scratches on her chest, and Dr. Grey immediately starts consoling her, telling her she will help her - then the girl explodes into flame, which covers Dr. Grey as well...",0
"The next scene shows us a very disheveled Dr. Grey sitting bolt upright in bed, locked up in the prison where she works.",0
She has no idea where she is or what has happened to her.,1
"She finds out that three days ago she had gone home and killed her husband ( Charles Dutton ), who was also the'boss' at her place of work.",0
"Devastated, she sets out to find out how this could have happened.",0
"She has no memory of what happened, all she remembers is the girl.",1
"The bulk of the movie that follows involves a lot of""boo"" scenes, as I call them - scenes that make you jump.",0
This type of thing was really overdone.,0
"Well placed, these scenes can really add to a movie, but when there are too many you start to expect them and they lose their effect.",0
I'd much rather have a movie that messes with your mind rather than tests your reflexes.,0
"There are a lot of creepy shots of the girl as a ghost, who seems to pop up randomly.",0
"At times it seems like the ghost is just playing with her, spooking her at the most inopportune of times ( even though I am sure this was unintentional ).",0
"After a while, that starts to get old, after all, we have all seen this sort of thing before in other ghost movies.",0
"I'm not sure where it started, but I want to know why almost all ghosts in recent films walk strange, in a disjointed weird way.",1
"The first time I saw that it was creepy, but now it is practically cliche, and almost annoying.",0
"I don't know if I am giving anything away by saying this, but the whole""help the ghost find justice so they can rest in peace and leave me alone"" thing is just getting old as well.",1
I almost groaned when this theme popped up in the movie ( though I should have expected it ).,0
What I don't get is why ghosts in these situations completely terrorize the people they have chosen to help them.,0
"But of course, who am I to argue about the way a ghost reasons?",0
The climax of this film was a bit anticlimatic.,0
"I don't know if I was just fed up with the blabbermouths behind me, or if I really didn't care how the movie ended.",1
"The pieces just didn't seem to fit right, like they were parts from a different movie or something.",1
The suspense in this movie could have been done a bit better.,0
"Some parts worked, most didn't.",1
"A lot of stuff was immediately obvious, and the'twists' weren't all that surprising.",0
I didn't really notice the special effects: that means they were good enough that they didn't stand out - that's a good thing.,1
I don't like it when the special effects are obvious - they should blend with the movie.,0
"There was one scene that could have been done a bit better, but overall the few times special effects needed to be used, they were done well.",0
"Despite the negativity about the movie, I do feel that Halle Berry did a really good job of playing the part of Dr. Grey.",0
Penelope Cruz was also very good as the highly disturbed Chloe.,0
"Robert Downey Jr's character ( Pete Graham ) was a bit shallow, but I think that may have been intentional.",0
"Overall, this movie is probably worth seeing.",0
"I am left with an empty feeling where the creepiness should be after a good ghost story, so I'm a bit disappointed.",0
"This movie is rated R in the US,"" for violence, brief language and nudity"".",0
I don't remember any nudity ( well they were naked but it didn't show anything! ).,0
"In Canada it is rated A, which means you only have to be 14 to get in ( much to our dismay at the noise and rowdiness in the theatres ).",0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot.,0
"The Gothic tradition of violent change enveloped in mystery and steeped in moody atmosphere is re-imagined by Hollywood in"" Gothika""...or so they want you to believe.",0
"Halle Berry plays criminal psychologist, Dr. Miranda Grey, whose stable life is turned up-side-down after an accident on a bridge during a dark and stormy night.",0
"She awakens, shocked to find herself incarcerated at the Woodward Penitentiary for Women, alongside the criminally insane patients she once treated.",0
Unable to remember having committed an unmotivated act of such sheer brutality against a husband she loved and admired ( Charles S. Dutton ).,0
My first thought was: Don't most wives that murder their husbands wake up in jail first?,1
"As poor Miranda tries to regain her memory and prove her innocence, she is untimely haunted by disturbing visions that further persuades evidence of madness by her former colleagues, like Dr. Pete Graham ( ROBERT DOWNEY JR. ), Miranda's sympathetic but skeptical coworker who is wrestling with issues of his own - he is in love with Miranda.",0
The visions in question concern a mysterious young woman shivering naked in the road during that dark and stormy night when Miranda's trouble began.,0
"These images are from a vengeful spirit in Miranda's mind, causing her to question many things about her own beliefs in psychology - such as, maybe the patients that say they are hearing voices really are hearing voices - and that perhaps she herself is possessed.",0
"In an ironic twist, we find Miranda's own treatment mirroring her old therapies used on dangerous patients such as Chloe ( Penelope Cruz ), whose confessions of satanic torture were dismissed by the prude Miranda as ramblings.",0
"The problem with being crazy is that no matter what you say or how well you say it, they'll still think you're crazy.",1
"This would have been a welcoming topic to play upon even if it has been done before, but the moment comes and then it passes as a means to give the viewers an uneasy feeling.",0
Halle as a criminal psychologist was not a believable job.,1
She struggled on medical terminology and her character seemed unacquainted in her own environment.,0
"Miranda the patient was a more plausible impression, considering Halle Berry has a natural confused look on her face which enhances this role.",0
The movie talks horror and fear but delivers none.,1
"The ambience has a natural feel for any"" B"" horror film, yet the actual scare tactics are implied by the storyline: The audience""needs"" to be afraid for Miranda, but the writer and director assume we will be.",0
"Instead of walking us slowly through these moments, we are intended to use the totality of the movie as a""what if"" scenario.",0
#NAME?,1
That's not scary.,1
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot.,0
Anyone old enough to remember the TV series CIRCLE OF FEAR or NIGHT GALLERY?,0
They were mid-70s show in the vein of Rod Serling's TWILIGHT ZONE but the little episodes were very predictable and formula.,0
"Usually, someone was murdered and, usually, their ghost came back for revenge in a number of bizarre fashions.",0
GOTHIKA is a throw-back to those old TV shows - a supernatural revenge story with state of the art special effects and some chilling cinematography that makes the movie look a lot classier than it deserves to be.,0
"Halle Berry, gorgeous and with a surprisingly good screaming voice, threatens to pull a Cuba Gooding Jr. with her post-Oscar career in this tepidly written horror movie with the inexplicable title.",0
"Berry plays Dr. Miranda Grey, a prison psychologist specializing in dealing with the criminally insane.",0
"Her primary patient, Chloe, played by the overrated Penelope Cruz, is a lisping example of over-acting.",0
"When Cruz screams some obscenities for effect and then tries to touch her doctor, she comes off as someone who's watched Isabella Rossellini in BLUE VELVET too many times.",0
And she ain't no Rossellini.,1
"Intentionally or not, the beginning of GOTHIKA has Berry misequating professional distance and aloofness.",1
"While Cruz goes into yowling hysterics, Berry calmly walks down the prison hallway, heading for her daily swim(!! ) Miscasting abounds when Berry meets up with her creepy husband played by Charles Dutton and her creepy co-worker, the stalker-doctor played by Robert Downey Jr.",0
"Dr. Grey soon finds herself on the other side of the cell bars, accused of her husband's murder.",0
Is she losing her sanity?,0
Is she guilty?,0
Are there ghosts at work?,0
The audience laughed when Downey described a patient's drug profile.,0
"Berry, obviously no student of ER, rattles off medical dialogue with all the conviction of reading her phone bill.",1
She also doesn't seem to mind some blatant exploitation - there's a shower scene that seems to be there solely for some gratuitous nudity.,1
But GOTHIKA's problems are multifold.,0
Blame the director for not giving his all-star cast some instinctive direction.,1
Blame the actors for not being interested in their characters.,1
And blame the writer for a script that needed a rewrite or four.,0
This is one of those whodunit horror movies that telegraphs its villains and victims well in advance.,0
The true horror of GOTHIKA is that Halle Berry's choice of material is so hit and miss.,0
Gothika is not a bad movie.,1
The problem is that it's not a really good movie either.,1
"Its just another"" thriller/mystery/ghost story"" in a long line of nearly identical films.",0
"The acting is well done, and the cast is made almost entirely of top-notch actors.",0
"Halle Berry, one of the best high-profile actors in Hollywood, is able to take any role and make it work, and Penelope Cruz is outstanding in this movie.",0
"Robert Downey, Jr., a man whose body of work I hold in much higher regard than his""brat pack"" peers, remains consistently believable in Gothika as well.",0
The problem is more the plot than anything else.,0
It's all so overdone that it wasn't hard to nab every aspect of it long before they were revealed.,0
"I had a few problems with believability, and by that I don;t mean suspended disbelief.",1
"I will accept the supernatural within the context of nearly any film, and this is no exception.",1
"I simply can't buy the idea that Berry would be put into the very institution she worked for and placed under the care of not only her peers, but one of her closest friends.",1
The effects and mood were done rather well.,0
The entire theater gasped and jumped at one particular scene - which is always a good sign for this kind of movie.,0
But the plot inconsistencies coupled with the fact that this movie beats a dead horse is enough to take away a few stars.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot.,0
"This was definitely""one to miss"" the first time I saw the trailer.",0
But you know what they say about curiosity and the cat.,0
"Mona Lisa Smile is what I guess you might call a"" f*ck tradition"" kind of movie.",0
Katherine Watson ( Julia Roberts ) gets a job as an art history teacher at Wellesley College.,0
But her students turn out to be a bit smarter than she was anticipating.,0
"So she changes her approach, and the class has a wonderful discussion about what art is ( or what it isn't ) and who is qualified to define it.",1
"Then Amanda Armstrong ( greatly played by an underused Juliet Stevenson ), one of the school faculty, gets caught distributing contraceptives and she is fired.",0
"Just goes to show ya, you don't mess with the rules.",1
"Strangely enough, though, it is commonplace at that very same school for teachers to turn their heads when the girls miss classes because they got married.",0
"As far as story goes, this is about as close to a story as it gets.",0
"Ms. Watson is content with questions, the girls have nothing but answers.",1
"Ms. Watson is content with life as a process, the girls want to get to the destination.",0
"Ms. Watson wants to teach these girls to be"" tomorrow's leaders, not their housewives"".",1
"But her students, four of whom we focus on in particular, have their own stories.",0
"Joan could get accepted to Yale, but she's not sure she wants to put off the""home life"" where tradition would have her be.",1
"Betty gets married right away, and starts to miss classes, but things only get worse at home too.",0
Giselle lives with a torrid past.,0
And Constance is just trying to make friends.,0
"Julia Stiles ( Joan ) is easy on the eyes, even if she does act 10 years older than she is.",0
Her accent was not too shabby.,1
"Meanwhile, the""other"" Julia ( Roberts ) struts her usual stuff.",0
"She's not terrific, but not terrible either.",1
"I think she may just be having a little too much fun playing miserable roles ( falling on the ice comes to mind ) when in real life, she is anything but.",0
But enough about that.,0
Ginnifer Goodwin ( Constance ) was just a cute girl playing a cute sideplot.,0
Kirsten Dunst ( Betty ) is just too damn pretty to be defiant.,0
"You don't want to see her upset,'cause then you get upset yourself.",0
She actually did a decent job b!tchin' it up here.,0
I kinda liked her hair too.,0
"Speaking of hair, who knew Maggie Gyllenhaal ( Giselle ) had so much of it?",0
I thought that stuff was gonna avalanche right out into the auditorium.,0
"As always, Maggie is excellent.",0
"Purely natural, graceful and highly in tune with her surroundings.",0
Watch out for her in the coming years; she'll be dangerous.,0
"I'm not sure what exactly Mona Lisa Smile sets out to say, except that maybe nothing is as it seems.",1
"I think the old traditions were society's way of""protecting"" women.",0
"So they could follow"" tradition"" or they can go their own way, but for most of the women in the movie, they end up miserable either way, unless they get rid of their guys.",0
Julia Stiles does get a great speech in toward the end in which she basically plays the kettle calling the pot black in return.,0
It's no better to blindly shun tradition than it is to blindly follow it.,1
Something like that.,0
So I wasn't really sure which side I was on by the end!,1
So I can't say the movie didn't make me think.,1
"On the other hand, I'm not sure what exactly I AM thinking.",1
"Recommended for females, intellectual people, modernists, Maggie Gyllenhaal fans, and those with a great deal of patience.",0
"Not me, though.",1

This review has been brought to you by the Lean N Mean 2 write-off organized by sleeper54.,0
"The objective is simple, just write a review that's 666 words or less.",0
But since the deadline is tomorrow ( Dec.,0
21 ) I'm not sure why I'm talkin' like a recuiter over here.,1
Take care now ~,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot.,0
Mona Lisa Smile is a deck stacked in Julia Roberts' favor.,0
The movie's premise is that every girl in a certain 1950's women's college is biding her time until she's lucky enough to find a man to provide for her.,0
"In like a California breeze sweeps Berkeley graduate Katherine Watson ( Roberts ), to blow the cobwebs off of these young girls' unused minds.",0
"No doubt there were many repressed women in the pre-feminist era, but were so many of them gathered in one particular place?",1
The girls at Wellesley College are Stepford Wives in training.,0
"They let men treat them brutishly ( no physical abuse, mind you--the women just aren't allowed to think for themselves ).",1
Or they drink lots of booze and smoke up a storm.,0
"Or they sit around at night, practicing being spinsters ( particularly Marcia Gay Harden in a really thankless role ).",0
"In fact, the only role more thankless than Harden's is that of Kirsten Dunst, so charming in Spider-Man and such a prig here.",0
"As Betty Warren--the school's unhappily married, McCarthy-like reporter--the sole point of Dunst's character is to make everyone as miserable as she is.",0
Warren really takes passive-aggressiveness to an ethereal level.,0
"But there are a lot of cracks in Katherine Watson's progressive thinking, too.",0
"First off, if she's such a smart thinker, why is Watson making time with a prof ( Dominic West ) who has a rep for sleeping with the students?",0
"Secondly, there's the little speech that one of the students makes to Katherine near movie's end.",0
"In effect, the student says that since Katherine wants every woman to make a choice, she's made her choice to be a housewife, and what's wrong with that?",0
"From the moviemakers' point of view, the speech is meant to be ironic, but it actually leaks the ugly little secret that radical feminists don't want to hear: Another woman's choice doesn't always agree with your own.",1
"Anyway, the movie gives its game away at about the halfway point, when the girls usher Katherine into their secret cult, just like in Dead Poets Society.",0
How progressive can a feminist movie be when it's set in the'50s and yet steals its ideas from a lousy'80s men's movie?,0
Mona Lisa Smile is rated PG-13 for adult language and situations.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals everything about the movie''s plot.,0
Premise - Tom Cruise stars as a frontier captain that's down on his life.,0
So he tries to sell new Winchester rifles by shooting at people.,0
He is recruited by the Emperor of Japan to fight against the rebellion of samurais.,0
"So Cruise trains the Japanese army, and they move out to battle against the samurais.",0
"As predicted from the previews, he then becomes a samurai himself, and then he fights against the emperor's army.",0
Review - Don't let this movie fool you.,1
I looks like an epic.,0
It stars Tom Cruise.,0
"It's big, loud, and it looks great.",0
"It has beautiful scenery, awesome battles, and it's well-acted.",0
"But, deep down inside, this is no better than an Ed Wood film.",1
"So, why is this a bad film?",0
"First, and most of all, it rips off other great films before it.",0
"There can be some ripping off, but this film goes overboard.",0
Here's all the things I can point out:,0
"Glory- Remember the part in Glory when Broderick shouts:"" Faster!",0
"Faster!"" while training the black army for the North?",0
"Tom Cruise, while training the Japanese, shouts:"" Shoot me!",0
Shoot me! Faster!,0
"Faster!"" Also, Broderick shoots a gun a couple of time to scare the black man and make him nervous to simulate a real battle.",0
Tom Cruise does the same thing.,0
"In Glory, after this ordeal, Broderick says:"" Teach them properly.""",0
Indicating that they are not ready.,1
"Tom Cruise says:"" They are not ready.""",1
Hmmm...Rip off?,0
"I let this slide, but there is oh so much more.",0
"Cool Hand Luke- Remember when Paul Newman is fighting that big guy in the boxing match, and he won't give up, even though he knows he is defeated?",1
"Well, in The Last Samurai, there is a scene EXACTLY like it!! Except, instead of boxing gloves, they're wooden swords.",0
The Patriot- Mel Gibson's character is not proud of what he did to some French soldiers.,1
Tom Cruise's character is not proud of what he did to some of the Native Americans.,1
Dances With Wolves - Kevin Costner's character was an frontier man who then becomes like the Native Americans.,0
"He learns their ways, and learns to love them.",0
Tom Cruise is a frontier man that becomes like the Samurai.,0
"He learns their ways, and learns to love them.",0
The whole gripe I have is the fact that this movie shamelessly rips off so many more movies before it.,0
"Though I listed only 4 examples, I counted 10 when I first came out of the theater, but I can't think of the others.",1
"However, it rips off hundreds of characterizations from other movies and books.",0
"Other than the rip offs, I find it very funny how Tom Cruise, the all-mighty white man, it the only survivor of the entire Samurai army.",0
"I'm sorry, when thousands of bullets are flying right to you, you are going to get hit, and you are going to die- PERIOD.",0
"Also, the nightmares Tom Cruise had about killing the Native Americans never really comes into full focus.",1
"He seems to have just had these nightmares, but after these nightmares, these actions don't come in anywhere else in the movies.",1
"And he blames this one guy that led the attack for all this, and Cruise himself shot the natives without question.",1
He didn't even really put up a good fight against his commander's orders.,1
He doesn't even get tempted not to shoot.,1
He just fires away.,0
It could have been a great movie.,0
"It could have been excellent, and to all the people who have forgotten about the older, greater movies before it, will think that as well.",0
"It does have beautiful scenery, some of the best since Lord of the Rings.",0
"The acting is well done, and I really liked the son of the leader of the Samurai.",0
"He was a likeable chap, and I hated to see him die.",0
"But, other than all that, this movie is nothing more than hidden rip-offs.",0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot.,0
I wish I hadn't seen this movie.,1
"I wish that Roger Ebert hadn't given it 3 out of 4 stars and said, this is one of those rare Christmas comedies that has a heart, a brain and a wicked sense of humor, and it charms the socks right off the mantelpiece.",1
Did Roger and I see the same movie?,0
I'm thinking no because I walked out of that theater feeling like I had wasted 95 minutes of my time.,1
"I went in thinking gee, this is gonna be a neat movie.",0
"In truth, it was one of the worst ones I've seen this year.",0
sigh,0
Maybe my expectations were too high?,0
The Story,0
"Thirty years ago, Buddy ( Will Farrell ) is placed in an orphanage, waiting for some nice family to adopt him.",0
"Christmas Eve, after some nun puts him to bed, Santa Claus ( Ed Asner ) drops in to deliver gifts.",0
"Buddy, seeing a teddy bear peaking out from his sack, crawls out of his crib and into Santa's bag.",0
Santa doesn't know that he's taken Buddy back to the North Pole until he crawls out of the bag in the Elves Workshop.,1
What's a Santa to do? Hand him over to Papa Elf ( Bob Newhart ).,0
Papa Elf does his best to raise little Buddy.,0
"The thing is, little Buddy isn't so little.",1
"Since he was a young boy, he's always towered over all of the other elves.",0
"After years of not fitting in, Papa Elf finally tells Buddy that he's adopted.",1
His father Walter ( James Caan ) ( who doesn't know about Buddy ) lives in a magical place ( New York ) and his mother Susan ( Jane Bradbury ) died shortly after he was born.,1
Buddy decides to move to the magical city and reunite with his father.,0
"Walter, who is on the naughty list, is a ruthless publisher by day and an inattentive father to Michael ( Daniel Tay ) and husband to Emily ( Mary Steenburgen ) by night.",0
Buddy doesn't get the joyous reunion that he was expecting.,1
"For days, his father doesn't believe that he's his long, lost son.",1
"Walter, wanting to put this nonsense behind him, gets blood drawn from the both of them.",0
His Dr. ( Jon Favreau ) confirms: It's a boy!,0
"Not knowing what to do, he takes Buddy home to the family.",1
"His insistence on continuing his childish, elf behavior, rides on Walter's nerves.",0
Can he accept his grown son?,0
Especially in his current altered elf state?,0
"In other news, Buddy finds his way to Gimballs department store where he fits right in with the other help dressed as Christmas personnel.",0
That's where he meets THE girl - Jovie ( Zooey Deschanel ).,0
He's immediately smitten with her but not because she has a hot body.,1
Does Buddy gain the acceptance he's been craving from both his father and Jovie?,0
"Believe me, you won't care.",1
"You'll be asking yourself, is there a way to leave this movie without offending my child and husband???",1
The Scoop,0
Where to begin?,0
I used to have great love for Mr. Jon Favreau.,0
"After all, he is just a week younger than me and a fellow Libra.",0
I loved him in Love and Sex.,0
I adored him in Swingers.,0
"Of course in both of those circumstances, he was the actor and not the director.",1
And maybe that's the issue.,0
"Maybe the man is meant to be an actor and not a director because if he stays on the directing path, he's surely headed for a disasterous career ending...",1
So what did he do wrong?,0
Let the list begin.,0
"First, Jon must think that if he chops a story up into a bunch of little skits, inserting a ton of physical comedy, then a movie will magically rise from it all.",0
Presto!,0
It's magic!,0
"In the case of Elf, it's a mess.",0
I kept on looking for a point to the story.,0
"The premise of it, written by David Berenbaum, was pretty blase to begin with.",0
"The only way Jon could have rescued it was to ensure that he had a capable set of actors along with a sentimental heart-beat running throughout, in order to keep the audience's attention.",0
"Second, the only time he seemed to elicit a laugh from the audience was when he resorted to using material that 8/9 year old boys laugh at.",0
Farting - that was fun ( not ).,1
Eating gross things.,0
"Yep, that elicited a lot of laughter from the crowd ( but mostly the under 10 group ).",0
"Second, could he have toned Will Farrell down a notch or two?",0
"Or perhaps, could he have had Will act something other than a one-note whiner of an elf?",0
I don't think that I'll ever be able to watch SNL again for fear of a headache.,1
So let's talk about Will Farrell.,0
If he was playing my kid - as either a child or a full grown adult - I think that I would have to smack him.,0
The way he played the character of Buddy wasn't what I was expecting.,1
"Instead of the wide-eye innocence that you get with other not so clued in movie characters ( think Tom Hanks in Big ), what you get here is a one-track, annoying and irritating male.",1
"I kept on thinking - if Jon Faverau can't direct you, do something for yourself dude!",0
But he didn't.,1
"And that's so sad, too bad for him.",0
Looks like Jack Black won the cross-over award for the year.,0
"Mary Steenburgen, Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, and the rest of the actors were fine enough.",0
It's not like there was any Oscar-stretching material that they were having to deal with.,1
They were merely background scenery to the Will Farrell show.,0
"And to top it all off, there was no memorable soundtrack.",1
C'mon now.,0
Christmas music is so easy and it's plentiful!,0
"I know that as the credits rolled, I saw songs by Ella Fitzgerald and Lena Horne but hey - I must have totally zoned those out.",0
Here's the bottom line.,0
The movie had no heart.,1
There was nothing present that made me care for the story or for any of the characters.,0
No heart=the inability for me to overlook the mistakes made by Jon Favreau's poor directing.,1
The End,0
Elf is rated PG for some mild rude humor and language.,0
Your 6-9 year old will probably laugh more than you.,0
How pathetic is that?!,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
Ok let me get this out of the way: I did NOT like this movie.,1
Borderline hated it.,0
"Now if you are only after positive reviews, then you might skip this, but if you are interested in why I thought it sucked, read on.",0
"To begin with, I only mildly like Will Ferrell.",0
"I don't think hes funny at all on SNL, but I was willing to give him a chance.",1
"I had seen previews for this a few weeks before it came out and it looked interesting, so I figured I would give it a shot.",0
"I'm very thankful that a local theater gives military discounts, I only paid $ 5.50 to see it, and after watching the movie, I feel like I COMPLETELY WASTED my money.",0
It's a 100 % kids movie.,0
There is ZERO bad language in it.,0
The special effects and props are EXTREMELY low budget and so fake its not even funny.,1
"You can clearly tell what parts were filmed on a sound stage, as the backgrounds are blatently fake, no effort was put into them.",1
"Will Ferrell plays Buddy, an adult elf.",0
"The whole plot is basically that he snuck into Santas toy bag as a baby, wound up at the north pole, and was raised by elves.",0
"He comes to find out he has a father, played by James Caan, and goes on a journey to New York in search of him.",0
That's the entire plot right there.,0
I'm not going to bother spelling out what happens in the movie because enough people mentioned it already.,1
The purpose of my review is for adults that think its a comedy and want to check it out.,0
I regret ever seeing it.,0
"Almost every""funny"" part is in the previews.",0
Here are the funny parts: he drinks an entire 2 liter of coke and lets out a 30 second ( or so ) belch; a scene where he tries to put a star on top of the christmas tree and it comes crashing down on him; he attacks a fake Santa at a store because its not the real Santa.,1
"Yep, there you have it, those are the funny parts.",0
"No really, stop laughing.",1
"There is no bad language at all, nothing derogatory, no put downs, nothing sexual.",1
I'm actually surprised Disney didn't make this movie since Disney movies aren't funny and geared towards kids.,1
The plot is pathetically weak and totally predictable.,0
It's one of those Ernest Saves Christmas type movies.,0
"After watching this flick, I will never watch Will Ferrell again.",1
He's just NOT funny.,1
"In fact, if I were him, I would be ashamed of myself for signing such a horrible contract and agreeing to make a lame movie like this.",0
Ok... so anything positive about this movie?,0
"No, not really.",1
"Actors are brain dead, rely on childish type humor to make the audience laugh, and you don't do a very good job convincing the audience even for a moment that this is a fantasy flick.",1
"I'm sure children would like it, as its geared strictly for them.",0
Adults who like clean humor and Disney type not funny movies will probably like this.,1
"It's a completely disconnect the brain, plan on wasting some money and a few hours of your life, and go see it.",0
"I don't recommend this to anybody looking for a serious laugh, or even a little bad language.",1
"Obviously this is just my opinion, I don't expect others to feel this way, but if you like adult humor, decent acting, a movie with a plot, and a believeable movie set, then avoid this movie like the plague.",1
"If you have seen it and disagree with me, to each his own.",0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
"There's a big hole at the center of Elf, and his name is Will Ferrell.",0
The movie's premise is that Santa Claus ( Ed Asner ) accidentally hijacks a baby to the North Pole.,0
The baby is named Buddy ( played by Ferrell ) and raised by a senior elf ( Bob Newhart ) as one of the North Pole's own.,0
"Eventually, Buddy is sent back to his home town of New York to find his biological father ( James Caan ).",0
The opening scenes are a letter-perfect take-off on the Rankin-Bass Christmas TV specials.,0
"And Newhart's straight-to-the-camera, deadpan narration sets the perfect tone.",0
"But as soon as Buddy hits Manhattan, the movie starts going awry.",0
There are many scenes of broad physical comedy where Buddy is overawed by modern life and misinterprets people's commands to him.,0
"If ever there was a pregnant premise for comedy, a naive, six-foot-tall elf set loose in unforgiving New York City ought to be it.",0
But Will Ferrell is not the man for the job.,1
"Steve Martin and Jim Carrey have the wild abandon for this kind of thing, and heaven knows what elfin Robin Williams would have done with the role.",0
"But Ferrell, another of those"" Saturday Night Live"" vets who go for nothing beyond the quick laugh, can't milk a routine to save his life.",1
"And while everyone else in the movie seems sincerely committed to the story's potential sweetness, Ferrell's elf is little more than a variation on his""SNL"" old routine as a hyperactive male cheerleader.",0
"Elf is inoffensive enough, and kids will probably lap it up.",0
"But even the children at the preview audience seemed more grossed out than cheered by some of the movie's Ferrelly Bros.-like humor, such as Buddy re-chewing discarded bubble gum or pouring maple syrup on everything he eats.",0
"If you're a discriminating adult, Elf probably won't be much more palatable.",1
Elf is rated PG for minor adult language and references.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
"Of all the cartoon classics that made themselves a daily routine during those sweltering summer vacations in Jacksonville, The Cat In The Hat ranks as possibly THE one that I watched the most.",0
"If machines could think, that VCR probably would have dealt me a few spankings of its own.",0
I felt mostly ambivalent toward 2001's The Grinch.,0
"While I liked what they did, it just wasn't the same.",1
"With The Cat In The Hat, it's mostly more of the same.",0
"But I hesitate to have too much faith in my own intolerably inane skills as a critic, because how do you know when exactly you're crossing the line between saying that the movie blows and saying that growing up blows?",0
Maybe that's all it is.,0
I'll tell you this much -- I laughed.,0
I had a good time.,0
"There were loads of one-liners, funny faces, pranks, and even a few brushes with vulgarity ( none of which would compel me to deprive my own kids of the pleasure, had I any ).",1
"The atmosphere was right on target, even if much happens outside the house itself.",0
There's difference number one.,0
The differences between the new and the old go on for miles.,0
"Foremost among them is the plot, and in second place is a whole lot of character conflict.",0
"But let's start with the plot, shall we?",0
"In the original, it was all about trying to find that moss-covered three handled family gredunza.",0
"The cat busted in the house all angry, the kids just looked at each other like"" What?"" Remember that scary music that played?",0
"Here, it goes completely the other way.",0
The Cat appears out of nowhere and the kids run away screaming.,0
"Then, they just start having fun.",0
"That's basically it, except for some line of bologna about showing the boy ( Spencer Breslin ) how bad it is to make a mess.. by making a bigger one, and showing the girl ( Dakota Fanning ) how not to be so uptight.",1
"( Deja vu, anyone? )",0
"In the original, the fish was THE antagonist.",0
"He was actually a frustrating character to watch, and when he was finally converted via a little language lesson ( a gato in a sombrero, you say? ), it was such a great moment!",0
"Here, he is just another victim of the haphazard shenanigans, or worse yet, a reminder of how much better Finding Nemo was.",0
"Closest thing to an antagonist here is a next-door neighbor who is trying to impress the kids' mother by looking like a rich guy, but actually has false teeth and a beer gut, and sits in his house watching you-know-what.",0
No kidding.,1
Even more outlandish is his unsubstantiated obsession with disposing of the son by sending him off to military school.,0
"Dylan was right, the times they are a changin'.",0
"One of my favorite parts of the original was when they went on the big scavenger hunt for the moss-covered three handled family gredunza, and they have to mark all the places where it isn't.",1
"It isn't in this keyhole ( No? ) and it isn't on my knee ( Hmm, mark the keyhole K-300, mark the knee 57-G! ) Okay, it's a little sad that I still remember that.",1
But I was saddened that they couldn't have found a way to at least incorporate this into the new one.,0
"Or how about"" Nobody Loves Me""?",0
"As if this all were not enough, the mystery surrounding the mother has been completely uncloaked.",1
"She's a legally blonde... something, I don't remember ( my bad! ) and she is hosting a party at her house that night.",1
"If it's not clean, she will be fired, because her boss has verminophobia.",1
How perfect is that?,0
Couldn't they just have gotten the house clean for the sake of having it clean?,0
Why do we need an elaborate backstory to it?,0
Thing 1 and Thing 2 are only there because they have to be.,0
"And not to hit below the belt or anything, but they looked absolutely frightening!",1
Humor these days has become so random.,0
"I think it's almost gotten to a point where"" the more absurd, the better"".",0
"There are traces of toilet humor, situational humor, irony, exaggeration, sarcasm and all that jazz.",0
Chances are you're going to laugh more than a few times.,0
But you may groan as much.,0
"As far as songs go, the Cat himself got to sing and dance, and he was quite the wire jumper.",0
"But oftentime, it went by so fast that you could barely tell what he was saying.",0
"I don't know how much Smash Mouth paid ( or got paid ) to have 1/3 of their album played behind this thing either, but it must've been a pretty penny!",1
Acting? Don't ask.,1
This is the stuff of third-grade school plays.,0
"Which, as I always say, is probably the whole idea.",0
But I'll say this much -- Sean Hayes playing the Mom's boss makes the wildest Jim Carrey look like a sane individual.,0
His character is utterly SMACKED out of his mind.,0
"Sean's""moment"" near the beginning was one of my biggest laughs.",0
"Don't know if the same will hold true for you folks, probably not!",1
"Bottom line, don't be a rule breaker.",1
"Above all else, Keep It Simple Stupid!",0
"Oh, but how funny is it that I should bring up KISS while talking about this movie!",0
You know what I'm about to say...,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.,0
"I'll be the first to admit that I was never a big fan of Dr. Seuss's, Cat In The Hat.",1
"My speed was more, In A People House and Green Eggs and Ham.",0
"When Ron Howard and Brian Grazer announced that they were moving forward with a Cat In The Hat movie, I wasn't expecting much.",1
"After all, The Grinch, also based upon a Dr. Seuss book, had a lot of flash, but not much substance.",1
So why did I go?,0
My nine year old loved the trailers and hey - who can say no to a nine year old?,1
"Off we went, braving the crowds of snotty-nosed kids, and stressed-out looking parents...",0
"I assume you're familiar with the book so I won't rehash the entire plot...The movie loosely follows the book, taking lots of modern day liberties.",1
"The"" Mom"" ( Kelly Preston ) is a single parent to Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ) and Sally ( Dakota Fanning ).",0
"By day, she works at Humberfloob Real Estate for the meticulously, germ-free, Mr. Humberfloob ( Sean Hayes ).",0
"By night, she allegedly dates next door neighbor, Quinn ( Alec Baldwin ).",0
Conrad is your typical adolescent male.,0
Always getting himself into trouble.,0
Always harassing his sister.,0
Always trashing the house.,0
Sally is your typical good girl.,0
"She makes lists of things to do on her electronic organizer ( Make today's to do list, Be spontaneous, Research graduate schools ).",0
"One day, their usual babysitter is unable to stay with them and Mom must find a replacement.",0
"Before returning to work, she specifically tells Conrad and Sally that they are not to step a foot into the living room, or else.",1
"You see, she's throwing a very important party that night for work and the last time she did this, her house was a mess and her neat-freak boss was on the verge of firing her for it.",0
"After mom leaves, the kids sit at the window, watching the rain poor down.",0
"A noise interrupts their boredom and when they go to investigate, they find the Cat ( Mike Myers ).",0
"After getting over their initial fears, they soon realize that the Cat is here to make their lives fun.",0
Fun!,0
"Too bad fun includes loosing the dog, trashing the house, and getting the kids in trouble with Quinn.",0
And that's enough of the story.,0
"I think this is also where I tell you...and by this point in the movie, I was ready to leave...",0
So what went wrong?,0
"The list is long, but distinguished.",0
"First, every good part of the movie was featured in the trailers.",0
That sucked.,0
"I can only venture that Universal Studios saw the movie, figured out how bad it was, but then patted themselves on the back for being able to pluck out three minutes of decent material.",0
For shame...,0
"Second, Mike Myers, who I normally adore, ran amuck with his one-person SNL skits.",0
"While those work in small, contained areas, or in less traditional stories like Austin Powers, he picked the wrong character to take off the beaten path.",0
"I was disappointed in him however, my real anger has been turned to the director, Bo Welch",0
Who is this guy Bo Welch and why did Brian Grazer allow him to direct a multi-bazillion dollar movie?,0
"What, his buddy Ron Howard wasn't available?",0
What about the three million other directors who could have turned this picture into something salvageable?,0
Here was Bo's biggest issue.,0
He seemed to be overwhelmed by the Dr. Seuss legend.,0
He seemed to be afraid to do different things to endear us to the characters.,0
"Instead, he let Mike Myers run amuck.",0
"Third, can we talk about the non-chemistry of Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin?",0
"Besides phoning in their performances, they seemed to have no real love for each other.",1
Perfect strangers have more chemistry than these two.,0
"Fourth, does Alec Baldwin THINK that he's funny?",0
I've got news for him.,0
He's not.,1
"I look at him and think, get a haircut.",0
"Fifth, who picked the music?",0
"And most importantly, why in the hell would you have Mike Myers sing?",0
"Ewww...the selections were horrible, not to mention the fact that the tunes stuck out like sore thumbs.",1
"Sixth, whoever was responsible for the special effects needs to enroll themselves in the Pixar school of creativity.",0
"There were several, obvious glitches and mistakes ( that should have been handled in editing but were not ).",1
"Overlooking the errors, anyone - especially Grazer or Welch - thinking that the special effects could carry the movie are obviously deluded and should seek strong medication immediately.",0
"Seventh, the ever-wonderful Sean Hayes, who also does the voice of the fish, was relegated to a minor supporting role which sucked because his character had the opportunity to take this movie in a worthy direction.",0
But oh no.,1
Mr. Director must not be able to deal with animated characters...,0
"Now Kelly Preston didn't offend me, so I guess you can say that this was the most redeeming part of the movie.",0
Cat In The Hat is rated PG for mild crude humor and some double ententres.,0
"Personally, I can think of better things to do with your time than taking your kids to see this movie.",0
Get a pedicure.,0
Clean out your attic.,0
Take a nap.,0
All much more worthy of your time... I promise.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot.,0
"After having heard so many positive reviews of the movie Elf, including a recommendation by one of the people I work with who only goes to the movie once a year on Thanksgiving, we decided to take the kids to see it on a rainy Friday afternoon in New York.",0
The film begins with Pap Elf ( Bob Newhart ) relating just how Buddy  managed to come to live with the other elves in Santas workshop at the North Pole.,0
Poor Buddy was abandoned to an orphanage and never knew his real parents.,1
He crawled into Santas bag while Santa ( Ed Asner ) was chowing down on the milk and cookies.,0
"For some reason, Santa failed to notice his presence until they arrived back at the North Pole and Buddy crawled out of the bag.",0
"Buddy ( Will Ferrell ) stays with them, but there are problems.",0
Hes twice the size of the other elves.,0
He is nt capable of building toys with the same lightning-fast speed as the other elves ( must be something genetic ).,1
"Finally, he has a heart-to-heart with Pap Elf who tells him all about his mother who put him up for adoption and passed away, and his father, who live in New York as a book publisher.",0
"Oh, and hes on the naughty list.",0
The rest of the story involves Buddys quest to find his family in New York.,0
"He finds his father, Walter Hobbs ( James Caan ) working in the Empire State Building, and discovers hes married with another son.",0
Walter was an interesting character.,0
"He did nt seem to be a bad guy, just someone who managed to get off track in life as his main focus became dollar signs and not being happy with his life.",1
"There are many people out there like this who go into one profession or another ( in Walters case, publishing childrens books ) because of their initial fondness for the work, and end up obsessed with the financial aspect.",0
This what how the character of Walter Hobbs struck me.,0
"Buddy may not have been the perfect elf, but hes picked up some amazing talents and abilities from being around them.",1
"When he and his brother, Michael ( Daniel Tey ) are being chased by bullies through Central Park, Buddy manages to create a whole armload of snowballs in the time it takes Michael to create one.",0
He can write a note on an Etch-a-Sketch faster than most people can on a pad.,0
Most of the really funny moments of the film comes as Buddy tries to adapt to the real world.,0
"When he hears Santa will be arriving at Gimbels ( a department store that s been out of business for quite some time, by the way ), he makes all sorts of preparations in the toy department for him imminent arrival, only to be shocked when it s an imposter.",0
"When he tries to go to work with his father, he is sent to the mail-room, where he befriends a man on parole who is something of a slacker, and together they turn the mail-room upside-down.",0
There are also some truly humorous moments as it s shown that Buddy is so out of place in the elf world.,0
"I dont know how it was done, but Bob Newhart was half the size of Will Ferrell, so this made for some pretty humorous situations.",1
There were also pictures of Buddy playing basketball with his fellow elves ( he looks bigger than Shaq ).,0
"Theres not much really in the way of gross-out humor, which was something I really appreciated.",1
"Buddy eats some pretty strange combinations of food, and indulges in maple syrup on just about everything, along with finding  gum in some pretty odd places, but that s about it.",0
"The one bodily-noise humor comes after he chugs a full 2-liter of soda, but my feelings of dread that this was going to take a downturn in the humor department after this were not founded.",1
Will Ferrell captures Buddys essence perfectly.,0
Hes got a child-like innocence as he wanders around the city and has no real idea of the consequences of his actions at times.,1
"Ferrell plays Buddy perfectly - I did nt see him as dumb, only innocent and naive.",1
"His expressions of wide-eyed innocence at the events going on around him are also near-perfect, and not exaggerated nor over-done.",1
I credit director Jon Favreau for a lot of this.,0
"The film could have easily descended into being a farce, but he kept it in line.",0
"The only bad point I came across was the ending which felt a bit too much like a rip-off of the ending to Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, but the kids really enjoyed it.",0
"Zooey Deschanel is Buddys love interest, a worker at Gimbels named Jovie.",0
"She seems alone in the big city  and for Buddy, it s love at first sight, although it takes a while for his Christmas spirit to rub off on the dispirited Jovie.",0
"Still, it s Jovie who on their first date takes him to see the largest Christmas tree of all.",0
"For me, that was the real star of the movie.",0
I love going into New York City at Christmastime and walking around to see all of the decorations.,0
"The movie captures the store windows with their Holiday displays, the beauty of Rockefeller Center, and the decorations in some of the out-of-the way places.",0
This film should do a lot for NYC tourism during the holiday period.,0
"While the film raptly kept my 8-year-olds interest, my 3-year-old was not impressed at all.",1
"It failed to capture his attention as many of the animated films do, and he fell asleep in my arms near the end.",0
"Although the film is rated PG, other than one friggin  and perhaps the burping scene and Buddys gum harvest, there was little that I could see that parents could complain about.",0
"It's also a good film if your kids still believe in Santa or are at the cusp where they are starting to have doubts, much like The Santa Clause was for my older daughter ( who opted to hang out with her friends rather than go to the theater with us - her loss ).",0
This is a fun film for the whole family to enjoy this holiday season.,0
Its got some terrific laughs.,0
"Im not a Will Ferrell fan at all, but I did enjoy this movie.",1
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
Christmas seems to be arriving earlier every year.,0
Halloween and Thanksgiving are now the forgotten holidays as stores and businesses strum up garland and other holiday decorations in order to prepare for the hopefully fruitful shopping season ahead.,0
"The movie industry must be thinking the same thing starting this year especially after the success of last years The Santa Clause 2, which opened the first weekend of November to nearly $ 30 million.",0
"New Line offers up their pre-holiday treat entitled Elf, which features the former Saturday Night Live comedian Will Ferrell, who has recently become a new rising star in Hollywood.",0
"After the dismal first half of the year with flops like A Man Apart and The Real Cancun, the studio bounced back in the second half with Freddy vs. Jason, Secondhand Lions, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and hopes to continue the trend until their mega-success The Return of the King opens near Christmas.",0
Can Elf do that?,0
"If it s anything like The Santa Clause 2, it easily could but the Ferrells comedy faces a lot more competition then Allens did.",0
"Not only does the film open up against The Matrix Revolutions, the yuletide feature goes head to head with the highly publicized The Cat in the Hat and Disneys The Haunted Mansion later this month.",1
"Until then the film will have to build up pretty good word of mouth for it to still hear cash registers ringing come Christmas Day, let alone Thanksgiving.",0
The story focuses a larger then usual elf who learns he is actually a human and travels to New York City to find his father.,0
"Up at the North Pole, elves are busy getting ready for Christmas but there is one elf that is learning that he does nt quite fit in.",1
"Buddy is not the typical elf, his large size being the biggest factor.",1
He eventually finds out from his adoptive father that he is actually a human that as an orphan baby climbed into Santas gift bag one Christmas Eve and found his way to Santas Workshop.,0
"After learning his true origin, Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and be part of a real family.",0
But this is easier said then done as his father is a real Scrooge and is prominently found on the naughty list.,0
"Buddy, who has never been to the human world, is unfamiliar with many of the things we are accustomed to like revolving doors and food products that dont include sugar.",1
The unusually happy elf must find a way to change his fathers workaholic attitude and help his new family find the true Christmas spirit.,0
"The story for Elf, though on the predictable side especially as the feature starts to wind down, works surprisingly well.",0
This happens mostly in part to Ferrells performance but there are also plenty of moments that come off as hilarious even without the lead star.,1
"Though the feature does nt have an exceptionally large cast, the film does nt have to with some lead characters picking up any slack left over by that.",1
"Will Ferrell, who was featured earlier this year in the hit comedy Old School, once again proves he has as much comedic timing and talent as he ever did on Saturday Night Live and probably even more so.",0
Ferrell is able to make Buddy the elf both lovable and hilarious without pushing the personality of the character too far as to make him annoying and pathetic.,0
"James Caan, who takes on the role of Buddys real father, has the grizzly workaholic business man down pat.",0
The only problem lied not with Caans performance but the character itself in how quickly the character changed his attitude at the end without really having a change-of-heart experience.,1
And a big highlight came from the performance of legendary comedian Bob Newhart as Buddys adoptive father.,0
Newhart looks like he had a lot of fun with this role and gives a delightful performance that many will remember despite being only a supporting character rather then a lead.,0
"Overall, Elf joins the ranks of such holiday features as The Santa Clause and Dr. Seuss  How the Grinch Stole Christmas that shows Hollywood is still able to make a yuletide classic as good as the old days.",0
Its the wonderful atmosphere and Will Ferrells exuberant performance that makes this film a delightful treat for the whole family can enjoy without one member of the family being alienated by certain material.,1
There are relatively few complaints that can be made about comedy.,0
The only one that is prominent in most minds would be that film tends to be bit predictable at the end of the feature but the filmmakers pull it off so well that many write it off and they should.,0
The slightly-predictable ending should nt ruin the overall amusement and delightfulness that the rest of the film presented up to that point.,0
"Ferrells over-the-top performance should be a decisive enough reason to venture to the local movie theater and see Elf but if you are not truly convinced, here may be a better reason: Elf will keep the children busy for an hour and a half while the parents do their Christmas shopping.",1
"Smart, huh?!",0
Elf is the story of a human who wandered into Santa's bag of toys while he was visitng a orphanage ( Will Ferrell ).,0
"He then grows up to realize that he is not an elf, and ventures out into the real world to find his father ( James Caan ).",1
"He finds him, and at first is not accepted.",1
"However, their relationship grows throughout the movie and it a great story, with humor for all ages.",0
"Ferrell's comedy, both physical and witty, is enough to make you fall out of your seat, even if you are sitting on the floor.",0
The situations he gets himself into by his curiousity and naiveness are endless.,0
And the irony of those situations is hilarious.,0
I can remember at least 10-15 distinct times when the whole audience sitting in the theatre laughed out loud.,0
"Although a comedy, this movie does have some touching moments.",0
"Heck, it made me cry.",0
"Not really cry like big time, but a tear did roll down my cheek, in more than one place.",1
"The funny thing is, it was two different emotions.",0
"One was sadness, and the other was happiness.",0
"Weird, isn't it?",0
"Anyway, I give this movie a great rating for its ability to play with my emotions.",0
"Laughter, happiness, sadness, and, yes, even guilt, played into my movie-watching experience when I payed my 9 dollars to watch Elf.",0
Great movie.,0
From Saturday night live to Old School and now to a even better and funnier movie...ELF.,0
Will Farrel plays the role of Buddy which is an unusual elf.,0
"An elf that is bigger than usual, has a lower voice that the rest, and is missing the pointy ears.",0
This movie is a very good family movie not just because it's about Christmas but because it has a good message to it.,1
The message that some people have forgotten the true meaning of Christmas and have given up on Santa.,0
Well this is a movie that you would want to see to bring back that Christmas cheer.,0
I have seen this movie twice now and can never stop laughing at Buddy's( Will Farrel ) actions to the city.,1
I really enjoy how Will can make a movie without using adult humor.,1
I only have one bad thing to say about this movie... I really don't like the angry elf.,1
Come join Buddy on his quest to find his father.,0
"As an actor, Will Ferrell shows promise for hilarious movies, thus I am driven to see them.",0
"From the previews alone, I have been dying waiting for elf to come out.",0
"I found it to be hysterical, as well as touching.",0
My boyfriend doesn't even like Christmas and told me he had goosebumps for the last 20 minutes of the movie.,1
Is there a lesson to be learned?,0
Does it matter?,0
Christmas is about feel-good movies and when do you feel better then when you are laughing,0
Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot.,0
"Sometimes, the problem with writing a review is just knowing whom youre writing it for.",0
Thats because your target audience is an important consideration when youre recording your impressions on any given product.,0
Do they have the same taste as you?,0
Will they at least be able to understand your analysis and critique?,0
"Any reviewer has his or her own biases, after all.",0
"Its important for a reader to identify this, and then take any advice in a review accordingly.",0
"So whats the point of all this in relation the Universal Pictures  The Cat in the Hat? Were getting there, so please be patient.",0
"Admittedly, Universal has been plastering the airwaves with a steady barrage of commercials for this flick.",0
"Theyve also marketed it to the max, and Cat in the Hat merchandise is to be seen lately just about everywhere you go.",0
"Now that the film has been released, however, it has been generally panned by the professional critics, and more than a few Epinions reviewers seem to have had similar impressions.",0
Theres just one problem with this that I can see.,0
"Above all, this is a childrens film ( though some adults will enjoy it ).",0
So what is the problem?,0
The children arent writing the reviews.,1
"That said, I thought I would attempt to take a kids perspective into view in writing my own review.",0
"But before all of that, let it be known that The Cat in the Hat is loosely based on Dr. Seuss childrens story of the same name.",0
"That story was not an exceedingly long one, so as you can imagine the film has been extended quite a bit with original material in order to make it a feature length film.",1
"Even at that, it s only about 82 minutes, rather brief indeed by todays standards.",0
The action follows little Sally ( Dakota Fanning ) and Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ) who live with their mom in a house like any other in the quaint town of Annville.,0
"As with any kids, Sally and Conrad have their own little idiosyncrasies.",0
"Conrad just loves to break the rules, and to do the opposite of whatever hes told.",0
"Sally, by contrast, is quite the opposite.",0
"Shes a stickler for being organized, prim and proper, so much so that it has cost her her friends.",0
Enter mom Joan ( Kelly Preston ).,0
"Shes involved with the guy next door ( Alec Baldwin ), who cant stand the kids, and is trying to convince Joan to place Conrad in military school.",1
"Joan is torn on what to do, and to add to her problems her retentive boss Mr. Humberfloob ( Sean Hayes ) wants to host an important company party at her home.",0
"Which must be, of course, spotless, dooming the kids to a rainy day of boredom.",0
"To keep the house clean, theyre restricted as to what they can do.",0
"Until, that is, a mysterious six-foot tall talking cat in a magical hat ( Mike Myers ) arrives and changes all the rules.",0
And that s how the fun begins.,0
And the movie is fun.,0
"Admittedly, Myers does at times fall flat more than a few times with lines that just arent that funny.",1
"But more often than not, hes very funny, and at times hilarious.",1
"His interaction with Sally and Conrad are well executed, and both Fanning and Breslin give adequate performances.",0
"Make no mistake, neither one is as charming as, say, McCauley Culkin in Home Alone or Uncle Buck, but they are convincing enough in their roles for the film to work.",1
Kelly Preston has little to do and not much time to do it in.,1
"Baldwin, however, is a convincing bad guy.",0
Its fun watching him go down.,0
Sean Hayes is also a lot of fun in his brief appearances as Humberfloob.,0
"Much of the magic of the film, however, is the fantastic world imagined by Seuss and brought to life on the big screen.",0
"The sets are delightful, as are the amazing characters Thing One and Thing Two.",0
The special effects that bring them and their amazing antics to life are a lot of fun indeed.,0
"With a stretched plot and at times juvenile humor level, this film wont appeal to all adults.",1
"I laughed a lot and enjoyed it, but for many it may be best to wait for this one to hit the DVD shelves.",0
But how about kids?,0
How do they like it?,0
"This is, after all, a childrens story.",0
"When we attended, the kids in the audience seemed magically enthralled, eyes fixed on the screen throughout the film and with nary a sound escaping their lips except for the frequent fits of laughter.",0
Kids 11 and under will likely love the film.,0
"There are a few moments of implied adult humor, but theyre mild and theres nothing that kids will really pick up on.",1
"At the end of the film, kids were calling the Cat cool, although Thing One and Thing Two seemed to get more praise than the Cat himself did.",0
"The film seemed to be very popular, and I think its rather brief running time is perfectly suited for younger ( and shorter ) attention spans.",0
There's even a bit of a moral at the end as the youngsters learn something about themselves through their experiences with the Cat.,0
Ill reiterate.,0
"The Cat in the Hat is a childrens film above all else, and when judged on that criteria it s a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with your youngsters.",0
"Dont expect more from it, and you may even enjoy the film along with them, as I did.",0
"This movie portrays the the children's story"" The Cat in the Hat"" in a very colorful and original manner.",0
The children are adorable and the cat is very amusing.,0
"I especially enjoyed thing one and thing two, with their over the wall antics.",0
"This is a truly original movie, which brings a cartoon to life.",0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals no details about the movie''s plot.,1
"I drag my friends to see Gothika, why?",0
Because I am a person who loves horror films--all types and the previews looked enticing enough.,0
"So off we went to see the film, and overall, I was impressed.",0
The videography of the film was great.,0
"Camera direction, eery set, but I think what made this film was the music.",0
"Yes, believe it or not, had the music not been suspenseful and skillfully placed at scenes where the audience got tense, then this film would have been a flop.",1
"The music added such intensity, it was similar to what made Friday the 13th films memorable.",0
Another thing that was great was the acting.,0
"Well, I am usually never disappointed with Halle's acting, she is extremely good.",1
But I was quite shock to see her play such a role that was different that her usual roles.,0
It was great!,0
She fell so many times during the movie that I know realize how she broke her arm on the set.,0
What was not so great about the movie was that there were gaps in the plot.,1
I would like to see more character establishment.,0
"Plus, the role that Downey Jr. played was a little unclear--was he an obstacle or not?",1
"Also, how did Halle get off from murdering a man?",0
These questions were not really answered.,1
The idea of the film is not new either.,1
"It was like a different version of the Sixth Sense, but in a more perverse way.",0
"However, I forgive that because it seemed to work out at the end.",0
"Overall, I would recommend this movie to people who loves to go out on dates, because if she is as squeamish as I, you will be in for a treat.",0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
Let's start at the beginning.,0
I adore Disney's Haunted Mansion in the Orlando theme park.,0
It is for everybody.,0
"It is funny/scary, and as Disney caters to CHILDREN, all is as it should be.",0
"Things are themed to death, ghosts, and the supernatural in a very fun and creative climate.",0
"Beginning with"" no windows and no doors,"" you are sucked right into the spirit of the house - moving doors, talking head in a crystal ball, hearse with skeleton horse attached, tombstones with funny saying on it.",1
The ride is absolutely very well done!,0
I see something new every time I take the ride and I've done it well over 12 times.,0
Okay - now let's translate that thought into a movie!,0
What a fantastic idea!,0
"The very first line"" Welcome foolish mortals"" made me just giggle.",0
"You begin the film with a married couple with 2 kids ( pretty standard Disney stuff ), and the dad is too busy at work ( again, par for the course, but we have been doing this since at least"" Mary Poppins,"" you know? ).",0
"So with one phone call, the family is drawn into"" the house.""",0
That the dad is Eddie Murphy to me isn't that special a thing.,1
"I think Eddie Murphy is less funny than he used to be, but he is one of only a handful of comedic black movie stars today.",0
You enter the house and see the cobwebs on the grandiose front entryhall.,0
"The monolithic ceilings, the candlelit hallways, the suits of armor, the gigantic fireplace ( might be known as gates of Hell, or it might not ).",1
"The busts in the walls move and watch you, there are hidden stairways, and most and best of all, there are ghosts everywhere.",0
"There are good ones and bad ones, and all the family take off in different directions with the mom being the most sought after by the house's owner.",0
I'm not going to give away the plot.,1
"Suffice it to say there is a trip to the cemetery with ghouls worse than in the new"" Pirates of the Carribean"" movie.",0
But they don't last long.,1
"And, of course, the boy learns to be a man in the process.",0
"The lady's head in the crystal ball is there, and she's even green.",0
"There's a barber shop quartet of busts, and even the hearse fits in there somehow.",0
"The ending is where the bad guys get their due, and it is, after all, a Disney comedy.",0
"This movie is not too scary for the youngest of children, but the plot might confuse kids under 8 or 9. PG is a good rating for a few mild oaths.",1
"Generally, if everyone would keep in mind that Disney makes things for children ( and there are always new ones coming along!!! ), they would know that this is just a wonderful experience, compared to THE CAT IN THE HAT which is obscene from what I've heard and read.",0
See this movie; take anyone.,0
"It kept my attention, and I am very Disney-fied.",0
"It lasts 110 minutes, and they are fabulous times.",0
"Well acted, well conceived, and great effects.",0
A great Disney romp!,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals no details about the movie''s plot.,1
"As the parent of a 5 year old who had just returned from a one week vacation at Walt Disney World, the inescapable fact was that we WERE going to see this movie (unless it was X-rated due to full-frontal nudity, etc. ) whether we adults liked it or not.",1
"After reading some of the critics reviews on the web, I had resigned myself that this would be an evening of altruistic self-sacrifice for the benefit of my child.",0
"Boy, was I wrong.",0
"The atmosphere of the movie was very similar to the Haunted Mansion ride at W.D.W., yet the sets were even more elaborate.",0
The casting was more than adequate.,0
"Eddie Murphy has found a new niche in the role of the well-intentioned, somewhat misguided father, similar to that he portrayed in Daddy Day Care.",0
"The rest of the cast was credible, with the most noteworthy performance from Terence Stamp as the creepy butler.",0
"Despite rumors to the contrary, there actually was a decent plot.",0
The special effects were flawless and sometimes subtle.,0
This is not the usual in-your-face CGI tour-de-force Hollywood product.,1
"It was a little scarier than I expected, but it was not too scary for my 5 year old.",1
"There was some mild swearing, but nothing that a kid doesn't hear on T.V. these days.",1
"Our whole family enjoyed it, and we all want to see it again.",0
I think that many of the unfavorable reviews this movie has received have come from those who have had inappropriate expectations and have prejudged the type of movie they expect it to be.,0
"This movie is not a comedy just because it has Eddie Murphy in it, and it is not a horror movie just because of the subject matter.",1
One could say that it suffers from typecasting.,0
"I personally don't want to take my five year old to a""real"" Eddie Murphy comedy or a""real"" horror movie.",1
"If you are looking for what passes today for""wholesome family entertainment"", a movie that will entertain your youngster without teaching him a new vocabulary, as well as not boring you to tears, then this is the movie for you.",1
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
I've got to admit that the first time I saw the trailer for Calendar Girls I wasn't exactly charged with anticipation.,1
"The trailer did manage to make the film look fun, but the concept strongly reminded me of The Full Monty, which is a film I personally found a little overrated.",0
"If I wanted to add further concerns I could tell you about how I decided to search Epinions for some reviews on the film, and my search revealed nothing but a small selection of more, adult titles.",0
"Nevertheless I recognized that not only did the trailer look fun, but I had been pleasantly surprised by another British comedy that didn't appeal to me, Bend It Like Beckham.",1
With those thoughts running through my mind I decided to throw caution to the wind and go down to the local cinema to see Calendar Girls.,0
"I'm glad I went to see it now, because the film has remained just that.",0
Fun!,0
"It tells the story of 2 friends named Chris and Annie who are members of their local Womens Institute, but when Annie's husband comes down with Leukemia their lives are shattered.",0
"Before he died he wrote a poem about his flowers, and mentioned how flowers are like Women, they get more beautiful with age ( note-this does not necessarily reflect my own opinion ).",1
After he's died the 2 of them decide to try and raise some money for a comfortable sofa in the hospital waiting room so that other grieving families can at least have a little comfort.,0
"However since the women's Institute never makes money off their sales Chris decides to try a different approach, and gets a few of the other members to join her in making a nude calendar.",1
"That's nude, not naked, because they think that as long as they keep themselves covered behind fruit and things then it will be OK.",1
"Needless to say the Calendar is more than a local success, and by the time Hollywood beckons they have enough money to buy a settee and still donate 99 % of their earnings to cancer research.",0
Yet was the cost worth it?,0
As with most comedy's of this type the main reason is succeeds is it's absolutely charming cast.,0
"The 2 main characters alone are played by award winning actresses, Chris by Helen Mirran ( The Madness Of King George ) and Annie by Julie Walters ( Educating Rita ) and both give wonderful performances.",0
Mirran absolutely nails the role of the fun loving Chris who has to remain down to earth for the sake of her companions.,0
"Walters gives a touching performance as the grieving widow determined to do anything to make money for others in her situation, but together their partnership becomes even more than the sum of it's parts.",0
They display an amazing amount of chemistry and play off of each other's style just enough to keep the characters believable.,0
They're supported well by an absolutely stellar cast though.,0
The cast features such names as Penelope Wilton ( Carrington ) Celia Emrie ( Bridgette Jones Diary ) and Ciaran Hinds ( Tomb Raider 2 ) among others.,0
"Yet most memorable of the entire cast is One Foot In The Grave's, Annette Crosbie, who plays Miss September, Jerssie.",0
"I remember seeing her and just expecting her to be playing an uptight, prim and proper lady.",0
Especially when she came out talking with one of the most believable posh English accents yet filmed.,0
However this confusion was the cause of some of the films bigger laughs as she was one of the more supportive characters.,0
Crosbie and the other actresses didn't have to rely on just themselves though because they had the support of some good writers.,1
"The film featured quite a few genuine laugh out loud moments, such as the scene where Chris's son and his friend walk in whilst she's demonstrating the modeling.",0
That and other jokes had the audience literally roaring with laughter.,0
"Yet what I liked best about the writing was not the jokes themselves, but with the way the material was handled.",1
"It's based on a true story, but that hasn't prevented historical inaccuracies in the past, and whilst I don't really know anything about what really happened, I do know that the film is more than just another feel good comedy.",1
"It actually gets the whole central story of making the calendar out of the way surprisingly early, but then goes on to examine the effects that modeling nude had on their lives.",0
"Chris's teenage son feels so humiliated by the calendar that he turns to, what he believes are drugs; and another of the women arrives home to find her husband leaving her for another woman.",0
Then as calendar really finds success they find themselves being exploited by people who have come to expect nudity from them.,0
Throughout the film the material was sensitively and honestly handled in this same manner.,0
Before I finish I will give mention to the films nudity.,0
It's never strong or prolonged but there are a few moments of nudity in the film that will likely earn the same sort of childish comments as Cathy Bates infamous scene in About Schmidt.,1
"I'll try to avoid those sort of comments here, but needless to say there will likely be some going in who wont be expecting any real nudity.",0
"For example I went in knowing the concept and was hoping that the nudity would remain what you see in the photo's, but in between the shoots there is some brief nudity, and the shoots themselves get a little close to the bar of a 12 rated movie.",0
"However you feel about nudity in films, it's unlikely that many people will actually want to see this so I posted this little warning here.",0
"If you don't think you'll mind some mild nudity involving older ladies though, then Calendar Girls is a fun, well acted and at times emotional movie that's worth seeing.",1
"Calendar Girls is rated 12A, for mild nudity and some bad language",0
The Haunted Mansion was a fun Disney movie.,0
"Because Disney produced this film, you would nt expect the film to be scary, but to the contrary, my wife screamed several times and grabbed my arm for protection.",0
I was on my honeymoon in Lake Tahoe when I went to see this movie.,0
My new wife thought it would be fun to see so I agreed to see it with her.,0
I was thinking that it would be lame as I thought Eddie Murphy did a bad job on Dr. Doolittle.,0
"I was shocked to find that the movie, Haunted Mansion, was actually acted out and directed very well.",0
The scary scenes mostly were a little scary and the funny scenes were funny enough to be laughed at.,0
I cant remember any part of the movie where I wanted to look down at my watch and see how much longer we had before we could leaveand Im a stubborn goat.,0
The film would be wonderful for children of any age as long as children under 8 had an adult close by for those scary moments.,0
There are very many wonderful treats film-wise ( effects and sounds ).,0
"I am one who analyzes films enough to predict the next action taken, but this film gave a few surprises ( I will be creating films as a computer animator, thus I analyze ).",0
"I found it interesting that the story was told well and it corresponded enough with the ride to have a familiar tone, but had enough originality that I did not feel as though I was on the ride I have ridden hundreds of times before ( being a former mouse employee ).",1
The beginning of the story took a while to run and made me a little anxious to get on with the rest of the film so I could see how the movie would relate to the ride.,0
I would suggest this movie as a date movie or a friends or family  gathering movieand a fun one to watch in a theater setting.,0
"As for home viewing, I would suggest it if you have a good bass backing.",0
"Wonderful job, Disney",0
"Not since Dan Akroyd donned his own thread bare red and white outfit, in the movie Trading Places, has the world seen such a sad and pathetic Santa Claus as the one played by Billy Bob Thornton in the newly released motion picture Bad Santa.",1
Kris Kringle will never be looked at in the same way again for anyone that sees this hilarious uptake on the bearded man from the North.,1
Willie T. Stokes ( Thornton ) as Santa Claus is like having Mr. T play Peter Pan.,0
It just does nt sound right.,1
"Thats what makes Bad Santa such a hilariously funny movie and one that I think fans around the world are going to love, possibly over and over.",0
"Remember the loveable Edmund Gwenn in the classic Christmas movie, Miracle on 34th Street?",0
You remember him for all the right reasons.,0
"He was caring, honest, and enthusiastic about being Santa.",0
Youre going to walk out of Bad Santa remembering Thornton for all of the wrong reasons.,0
"He cusses, smokes, drinks.",0
And that s all before breakfast.,0
Manhola Dargis of the Los Angeles times says of Thorntons character; A man whose talent for expletives would give.,0
"Dr Dre pause.""",0
"Tony Cox, who is probably best known for his work as the limo driver in Jim Carreys Me, Myself, and Irene movie, plays Marcus, Willies assistant.",0
For such a little guy he has a big job trying to keep Willie in line just long enough to finish another job and another Christmas season.,0
This is nt an easy task considering Willies tendencies but one that Marcus must do.,0
"The beautiful, sexy, and talented Lauren Graham, last seen with Keanu Reeves in Sweet November, plays Sue, a smoking hot bartender with a thing for Santa.",0
Graham brings a wonderful glow to the screen in her scenes with Thornton.,0
Her beautiful smile is breathtaking and could melt ice off the Rocky Mountains.,0
"Bernie Mac plays Gin, a chain smoking, orange eating mall security man that finds out more than he should about Willie and Marcus and gets more than he bargained for.",0
His scene with Tony where they try to get a drunken Willie out of the mall is so funny I had tears in my eyes.,0
"Newcomer Brett Kelly plays the kid, Thurman Merman.",0
"Snot nosed, overweight, and generally messed up in the head, Kellys scenes with Thornton bring out the humanity in a man that otherwise has none.",1
The late comedian John Ritter has a small part in this movie as the mall manager that finds out he may have hired the wrong type of person to be their store Santa after finding Bad Santa banging a heavy set woman in the dressing room of the Three Times a Lady  department.,0
"This movie, even with Thorntons disturbing language and attitude, was possibly one of the funniest that I have seen lately.",0
"Willies way with the women, his alcoholism, his smoking, all of these things made me want to love the character, to love the movie.",0
This movie is nt for little kids.,1
The language alone would make a Hip Hop crowd blush.,0
"But for adults, this movie could be one of the best of the holiday season.",0
I have nt seen Elf  yet but I seriously cannot imagine it being as funny for adults as Bad Santa.,1
Leave the kids at home and enjoy Bad Santa as soon as you can.,0
As a matter of record let me just say that if you are trying to quit smoking you probably dont want to see this movie.,1
I think I got lung cancer ( I know this is no laughing matter ) just watching this movie.,1
And if you are a recovering alcoholic you might want to sit this one out as well.,0
I am willing to bet that Stolichnaya Vodka was either paid or paid to have their product so visible in this movie.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
I first saw a preview for Bad Santa about four weeks ago.,0
I hadn't laughed that hard or that consistently at just a preview in a very very long time.,1
"That being said, I was nervous about this flick because there are oh so many times where the preview shows you the only good and or funny parts.",0
"For those who had the same fear as I did, you may have no fear.",1
"Bad Santa is the most deliciously gut-busting adults only comedy since 1999's South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.",0
"Directed by Terry Zwigoff ( Ghost World ), and produced by the Coen brothers ( Fargo, The Big Lebowski ), Bad Santa stars Billy Bob Thornton as Willie T Soke, a plus-size bottom sex craved depressed alcoholic who cracks safes.",0
"His partner in crime is Marcus ( Tony Cox, Me, Myself and Irene ).",0
"As a team, they set up shop in a different city each Christmas, Thornton as the department store Santa, Cox as one of his elves.",0
"On Christmas Eve, they rob the department store blind, usually to the tune of six figures in cash and untold value in merchandise.",0
"The set up this year is Phoenix, Arizona.",0
"They get a job at a mall, replacing a 5 years running Santa thanks to the penny pinching attitude of the mall/store ( it's unclear which one he really is ) manager, played by the late John Ritter in one of his final film roles.",0
"Within five minutes of having the job, however, Willie is already being looked at suspiciously by the manager, thanks to his constant swearing and his general drunk look.",0
"The manager then goes to the mall security guard, Gin ( Bernie Mac ), who is on a power trip that just won't end.",0
But the mall/department store part of the story is just the beginning.,0
"Within a day or two of beginning their jobs, an out of touch, overweight slob of a kid who is stuck with an awful name, Thurman Merman ( Brett Kelly ), visits Santa at the mall and quickly becomes enamored of Thornton, despite his surly and un-Santa like behavior.",0
""" The Kid"" ( as Thornton refers to him throughout the movie ) follows Thornton to a bar.",0
"It's in this bar where Thornton meets Sue ( Lauren Graham ), a girl with a big time Santa fetish.",0
"When Thornton realizes the kid has followed him, he takes him back home, where Thurman lives with his whacked out grandmother ( his parents are away for reasons that are revealed through the course of the film ), played by Cloris Leachman.",0
"Over the course of the movie, Marcus does his best to keep Willie out of trouble.",0
"It isn't easy, given Willie's penchant for having sex in the plus size fitting rooms, showing up late and or drunk to work, and becoming slower and slower on the safecracking year after year.",1
"Willie, meanwhile, becomes a sort of father figure to Thurman, despite the fact that he sees nothing but a loser in the kid.",1
"He questions why he doesn't stand up to the skate punks who pick on him, and tries his best to teach him to fight.",1
"One might think that with this set up, a warm, happy ending is in the cards.",0
Think again.,0
"What makes Bad Santa such a good movie, and not just a funny one ( an apt description for say, Mallrats, which is far from good, but damned funny ), is that it holds no expectations for itself.",1
It crashes down on the holiday season the way that the previously mentioned South Park film crashed down on musicals.,0
"The Kid does bring out a bit of humanity or soul or whatever in Thornton's character, but because Thornton's' Santa' is so black in spirit, any redemption or humanity is short lived.",0
The one drawback to the film is in some of its pacing and editing.,0
The scenes between Ritter and Mac in particular feel like they weren't even shot at the same time with them in the same room.,1
"Completely vulgar and politically incorrect ( a few choice losers are protesting because it's put out by a Disney subsidiary, I say to all of you: GET A LIFE), Bad Santa is most certainly NOT for the kiddies ( as if the previews didn't already make THAT expressly clear ).",1
"So if you and the wife/husband want a night out alone with a film that will make you laugh harder than any other film this year, get a babysitter and go see Bad Santa.",0
"Besides the kids, you may want to leave your pretensions at the house as well.",0
Bad Santa has officially topped Pirates of the Caribbean and Bruce Almighty as my favorite film of the year.,0
I give it 4.5 stars and a hearty HO HO HO recommendation.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
"If the title of this review offends you, stop reading right now.",0
"Terry Zwigoff's"" Bad Santa"" is not for you.",1
"But if you have a soft spot in your funny bone for the darker aspects of human nature, if the caustic comedy of directors like Danny DeVito and the Woody Allen of"" Deconstructing Harry"" causes you to break out in uncontrollable guffaws, if you're as fed up as Charlie Brown with the commercialization of Christmas cheer and would like to see this cynical marketing of a simple holiday blown a wet, beery razzberry, then read on, boys and girls, because"" Bad Santa"" is the film you've been waiting for your whole life.",0
"Many critics praise an actor's bravery when they take on a role like that of Cuba Gooding's mentally challenged football booster in the recent syrup production machine"" Radio"".",0
But a character like that is calculated to warm hearts and win Oscars; the risk factor is minimal unless you overplay and come off as a caricature.,0
You want a risk?,0
"How about trying out a role like"" Bad Santa""'s Willie T. Soke?",0
"Played by Billy Bob Thornton ( in a role originally intended for Bill Murray ), Willie is a boozy, foul-mouthed, degenerate nihilist with a soul as black as coal ( which is more of a Christmas gift than he ever got from his abusive monster of a dad ) who uses the Santa cover to case department stores which he then robs on Christmas Eve with his partner Marcus ( Tony Cox ), a little person who plays Santa's elf.",0
"All the while, Willie abuses the kids who come to see him, uses more four-letter words than the entire population of South Park, steals cars, carries on an affair with a waitress ( Lauren Graham ) with a fetish for Santa hats, nails overweight women in the big and tall dressing stalls, and drowns the fire of his self-hatred with enough booze to swamp the Titanic ( he rides up the escalator to"" Santa's Village"" lying on his face, a broken bottle clutched in his jolly old fist ).",0
"At one point, he wets his Santa pants right in front of the children, and this is actually one of his more forgivable offenses because he's so drunk he doesn't even realize what he's done.",0
"All the while, Willie spews invective at anyone who gets within his field of vision, cursing Christmas and family and the whole shebang.",0
Playing a character like this is a REAL risk.,0
"If you play it badly, it's just an embarrassment.",0
"If you play it well, some people will not be able to separate the actor from the character and excoriate the performer as a monster just for doing his job to the best of his ability.",1
"It is to the endless credit of Thornton, an actor who has made a career out of socially maladjusted misfits ("" Sling Blade"","" A Simple Plan"" ), that he seems to have taken to this role without a moment's thought about what a monster like Willie could do to his public image.",1
"He growls the character's endless obscenities with a phlegm-throated relish, throws himself into twisted misbehavior with heedless abandon...and what's most amazing of all, somehow manages, against all our better instincts, to move us with this portrayal of a hateful man by never letting us forget that he hates himself most of all.",1
""" I am not Santa Claus"", he tells a little boy.",0
""" If anything, I'm living proof that there isn't any Santa Claus.""",0
"Willie is a man who has lost his capacity to believe in anything, most of all himself, and the wasted excess that is his life is no Dionysian revel, but rather the extended suicide of a man who feels that he has more than earned all his self-inflicted suffering ( at one point, feeling that even he is being too easy on himself, Willie tries to take himself out with carbon monoxide in a garage...all while wearing the Santa suit, of course ).",1
"This is a character which, if handled incorrectly, could have ruined Thornton's career.",0
"Lucky for him, and for us, that the actor sees the humanity in Willie and lays it bare, along with the baser indignities man is capable of inflicting upon himself and the world.",0
"This is a monumental comic performance, funny as hell and lived in down to the gin-soaked bones by a great actor, and the Oscar nominees are incomplete if they do not include him ( which I have every reason to suspect they will not, as Gooding's Rain Man of the gridiron is much more the type of up-with-people role the Oscars tend to reward ).",1
"For all its dark R-rated excesses,"" Bad Santa"" is ultimately, like many of the greatest Christmas movies, a story of redemption.",0
"Willie, in Phoenix with Marcus for their annual Christmas scam ( they've been pulling their Santa heist for years, living high off the proceeds, but always financially dry as a bone come Thanksgiving ), finds that the job will not come as easy as it has to him in the past.",1
Their department store's sharp-tongued detective ( Bernie Mac ) and jittery manager ( John Ritter in his final film role ) are keeping a close eye on this suspiciously woozy Saint Nick.,0
His shakes are getting so bad he can barely crack a safe anymore.,0
"What's more, he has somehow, against all odds, made a friend.",0
"His name is Thurman Merman ( Brett Kelly ), and he's a sad, overweight eight-year-old boy who latches on to Willie and won't let go.",0
"At first, Willie takes advantage of the situation, moving into Thurman's house, which the boy shares only with a deeply out-of-it grandmother ( Cloris Leachman ); his father is in prison for insider trading, his mother""is in heaven with God and the baby Jesus...and the talking walnut"".",0
"But soon, Willie starts to realize that this sad sack of a kid, with his snot-crusted upper lip and Cupid-curls hair, who gets beaten up on a daily basis by skateboard punks and who exalts over an almost-all-C's report card, needs almost as much help as Willie himself.",0
"And Thurman, to his credit, does not believe that this bleary-eyed human trash heap is really Santa Claus.",1
"He just desperately needs to believe in something, or else one day he just might find himself in a Santa suit, throwing up in an alley, just like his new best friend.",0
"Thankfully,"" Bad Santa"" manages to tell this Yuletide story of a monster's salvation without resorting to the"" Will Ferrell learns the true meaning of Christmas"" cliches that have sent many a holiday audience into sugar shock over the years.",1
"Director Zwigoff's past films, including the remarkable documentary"" Crumb"" and the dark but surprisingly sweet"" Ghost World"", have evinced a soft spot for the disenfranchised and misunderstood souls of the world, and the miracle of those films is that he allows us to see and embrace the humanity of these creatures without soft-pedaling the weirdness and nihilism that has made them outsiders to begin with.",1
"Thurman's plight does make a dent in Willie's stone heart, but a dent is all it is; for all we know, he'll go right on boozing and cussing and banging fat chicks till his liver gives out and they carry him out in a pine box.",0
"Kelly, likewise, is not your typical cookie-cutter cute movie kid.",1
"Take"" The Cat in the Hat""'s Spencer Breslin, add about seventy-five pounds, yellow-crusted underwear, ill-fitting shorts, and an intensely eyes-locked-on-you manner that is as creepy as it is amusing, and you can understand why this kid gets pounded on every day.",0
"But when Willie is dumbstruck by Thurman's simple sweet Christmas gift of a wooden pickle, when Thurman announces that Santa hasn't brought him a Christmas present for the last two years""because I know I'm just a dips--t loser""...you can't help but root for these guys.",0
"Maybe not to become president, but at least for Thurman to get the pink stuffed elephant he so dearly wants for Christmas.",1
At least for Willie to find a reason to rise from the booze-and-puke puddle that is his life and see another dawn.,0
"That Zwigoff manages to move us with these characters, all the while causing us to laugh in disbelief at the extremity of Willie's awfulness and the film's lack of faith in the standard Hollywood-Christmas quick fix, is a great testament to both the director's delicate touch and to the skilled work of writers John Requa and Glenn Ficarra, who also scripted the darker-and-funnier-than-expected"" Cats and Dogs"" ( the script went through several uncredited rewrites, including one by executive producers Joel and Ethan Coen and one by Zwigoff himself ).",0
"Still, regardless of how unexpectedly touching the film may be,"" Bad Santa"" is still the blackest comedy in many a moon.",0
"I am personally tired of Hollywood pictures billing themselves at""outrageous"", when really all that means is that they include a few gross jokes about bodily fluids ending up in somebody's Sprite.",0
""" Bad Santa"" is the first comedy I've seen in a long time that is outrageous in the literal sense of the term; several critics have already excoriated it as mean-spirited beyond redemption, and a possibly-apocryphal internet news item had Walt Disney CEO Michael Eisner ( Disney owns Miramax subsidiary Dimension, which released this film ) denouncing the picture as an insult to the memory of the company's founder.",0
And the film is guilty of everything it's been accused of.,0
"It's foul-mouthed, it's sex-and-booze-drenched, it literally pees on the good feelings many of us have for the holiday season, it scores laughs off of midgets and elderly shut-ins and fat kids and drunks.",0
But you know what?,0
It gets those laughs.,0
"The audience I saw the film with laughed throughout the film, at several points so loudly that I missed lines of dialogue completely.",0
"Of course, there were people that got up and walked out, including the middle-aged couple sitting next to me.",0
"And to them I say, hey, different strokes.",0
"If you want a nicer Christmas movie,"" Elf"" is still playing across the hall.",0
""" Bad Santa"" is a refreshing antidote to all those other holiday movies that wrap the season in prepackaged, mass-marketed"" cheer"".",0
"It's a brazen, daring, no-holds-barred comic assault on many of the values that we hold most dear, from the sanctity of family to the importance of good personal hygiene.",0
"And, amazingly enough, it still manages to carry a potent message about how no person is beyond salvation if he can find it within his pickled, diabolical soul to commit one act that is for the good of the world and others.",1
""" Bad Santa"" reminds us of a message that is always useful to hear: no one, even the most loathsome of us all, is completely without value.",1
"It's the same message as"" It's a Wonderful Life"", albeit delivered with a lot more f-words and flying liquor bottles.",0
"And I suspect, among a small core of twisted, clever misfits,"" Bad Santa"" will join that Jimmy Stewart chestnut as a perennial holiday favorite.",0
"Best enjoyed, of course, with eggnog.",0
HEAVILY fortified.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.,0
So relieved Bad Santa had a happy compromising ending.,0
"What with the main character, Willie Stokes ( Billy Bob Thornton ) being a cussing, boozing, womanizing, thieving, insulting Santa it would be a let down if it did nt have a happy ending.",1
"Picture a man who was abused as a child growing up to be a fake Santa in order to rob the department store safe and expensive clothing, which is fenced.",0
Then taking off for Florida for a few months until the winter holiday restarts.,0
"Thats Willie and his elf partner in crime, Marcus ( Tony Cox ), a 3 foot Black dwarf.",0
Marcus tries to keep Willie in line just long enough to pull off the big score.,0
After that hes done with Willie and does nt want to see him again until the next Holiday season when they start up posing as Santa and his elf.,1
Willie is the worst Santa.,0
"He insults the kids (  Whadya want  Okay, get outta here  ) and arrives at work drunk.",0
"When they venture to Arizona with their act, Store Manager John Ritter thinks hes got a salary break: two for one.",0
He soon becomes suspicious of the two when he catches Willie using foul language in front of the kids and fornicating with a female clerk.,0
"The store detective ( Bernie Mac ) is consulted, and starts to investigate their past.",0
When he figures out what theyre doing  robbing the store  he wants a cut of the loot.,0
"Thankfully, there is a charming kid, Thuman Merman ( portly cherubic Brett Kelly ) who believes in Willie and adopts him as a surrogate dad.",0
"( I wont reveal where the real dad is ) No matter how awfully Willie talks to the kid, he so desperately wants a male figure he accepts Willie for what he is.",1
Theres an attractive barmaid ( Lauren Graham ) who has a fetish for Santas and has fun as Willies sex mate.,0
If these characters werent so unbelievably funny they would be implausible.,1
"Everything that s politically incorrect ( alcohol binging, swearing, loud-mouth insults ) is there.",0
Leave your purity and religiosity at home.,0
Billy Bob Thornton is such a versatile actor.,0
He played character-driven supporting roles and now hes lead in a black comedy.,0
"With a scruffy unshaven beard and a slouching body, his makes Willie memorable although unfavorably.",0
He and Tony Cox demonstrate perfect comic timing as crime buddies.,0
Brett Kelly plays the kid with such sympathy and earnestness you want to throw him a teddy bear for comfort.,0
You will laugh when you dont want to laugh and feel embarrassed for doing so.,1
Plot Details: This opinion reveals everything about the movie's plot.,0
"If you use""bad"" to mean""good"", then Bad Santa is very bad, indeed.",0
"Billy Bob Thorton plays Willy Stokes, a drunkard/safecracker, who with the help of his dwarf-friend Marcus ( Tony Cox ) robs shopping malls after posing as Santa during the holiday season.",0
"On this particular go, the pair winds up in Arizona, an inspired choice since the Southern California thing has been done to death.",0
"John Ritter plays a department store manager, who in an attempt to cut-costs, fires the store's regular Santa and hires the cheaper Billy-bob.",0
"Then, the fun begins...",0
"Billy-bob is so unredeemable and disgusting that you can't help, but laugh when brat after brat climbs aboard his tipsy lap and lists their demands.",1
"Billy-Bob whines and scowls his way through each day, and store manager, John Ritter, and partner in crime, Tony Cox become more and more agitated by Billy Bob's behavior.",0
"Meanwhile, Billy-bob has met Sue ( Lauren Graham ), who has a thing for being naughty, and a chubby snot-nosed loser played perfectly by Brett Kelly.",0
"( Brett's performance is perfect; he at once is repulsive and yet, somehow sympathetic. )",0
"The movie, however, begins to take a dark turn with about thirty minutes left.",0
"The mall's security officer finds out about the previous mall robberies by Marcus and Willy, and blackmails the pair.",0
"That in itself wouldn't be so bad, but eventually Marcus and his horrible girlfriend kill the security guard and during their annual robbery, double-cross Billy-bob.",0
"By this point, Billy-bob has not exactly reformed his ways, but now, at least cares enough about the fat loser kid to want to get him a gift ( a pink elephant ).",1
He's chased to the kids house where he's shot eight times while trying to deliver the stuffed elephant.,0
"I guess to the tune of a Christmas miracle, he survives.",0
"The film manages to revive itself a little with a letter that Billy-Bob sends the fat kid from prison and the movie ends, happily.",0
I really enjoyed most of this film.,0
The focus group ending bothered me; it felt a little bit like the writer didn't know how to end it.,1
"I wasn't a huge fan of the dark turn it took, but I didn't think it hurt the film as much as the happy ending.",1
The performances were all really fantastic ( all the supporting cast did wonderful jobs ).,0
"The script could have used some tightening near the end, but as I said, the""letter"" made up for it a bit.",0
I would highly recommend this to anyone who thinks what the malls have done to Christmas is a crime.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
"Calendar Girls, which has already seen a release in Britain, will be making its way over the Atlantic in time for the holiday season.",0
"Luckily, I get these nice invitations from the Philadelphia Film Society to attend sneak previews and premieres, so my wife and I found ourselves treated to a free screening of this film a good month before it hits theaters.",0
"This is not the type of film I normally enjoy seeing in the theater, by the way.",1
"For me, the big-screen experience is all about stunning visuals, thundering sounds, and jaw-dropping special effects.",0
"That said, I completely enjoyed Calendar Girls as a happy, spirited, light-hearted, peculiarly English comedy.",0
Characters and Plot,0
The Knapely chapter of the Women's Institute ( W.I. ) isn't very interesting.,0
"In fact, it's downright boring.",0
"Topics like the history of broccoli and carpets tend to predominate the presentations, and right from the beginning, we find ourselves laughing along with our two main protagonists, Annie ( Julie Walters ) and Chris ( Helen Mirren ), as they suffer through the deadly dull pontifications that make up the WI meetings.",0
"Early in the film, however, tragedy sets in as Annie's husband begins an unsuccessful battle with leukemia.",0
"Fairly soon after his death, the Knapely W.I. finds itself once again in the position of having to publish its annual calendar for charity.",0
"Instead of the usual church buildings or pictures of Yorkshire, however, Chris decides that something different is needed.",0
"After receiving some inspiration from one of her son's""adult"" magazines and a gas-station biker-chick calendar, she conceives the idea of a calendar picturing various members of the W.I. in the nude.",0
"Of course, they would be doing very W.I.-appropriate activities while in their birthday suits, so it would be more classy than crass.",0
The money raised would go to the local hospital's leukemia ward.,0
"Soon, despite opposition from the local chapter president, and some last-minute pleas to the general W.I. convention, the calendar goes to press.",0
"What follows is a media frenzy that was entirely unexpected, leading to BBC spots, tabloid reporters, Late Night appearances, sleazy Hollywood directors, and lots and lots of money raised for the local hospital.",0
What Did I Think?,0
I really liked Calendar Girls.,0
"Part of its charm as a film is its very charming cast of characters, especially the female leads.",0
"Helen Mirren sparkles as Chris, portraying a small-town woman with an abundance of energy, enthusiasm, and grit.",0
"Julie Walters brings a quiet poignancy to Annie, with an undercurrent of humor and grace.",0
"Almost all of the other W.I. women are very believable in their characters, with a whole range of body types and personalities to round out the calendar ( and film ).",0
One of the wonderful elements of this picture is its celebration of beauty outside of Hollywood and magazine pages.,0
"Helen Mirren, undeniably a very attractive older woman, brings a spark of glamour to the story, but the very ordinariness of many of the other women, and the art with which they are presented in the calendar is a refreshing reminder that beauty can be more than we see in Cosmopolitan and Access Hollywood.",0
"Despite all the high-sounding declarations above about beauty and truth, the simple fact is that this is a fun movie.",0
The subject matter lends itself to all sorts of hilarity.,0
"From the reactions of the models' husbands and families, to the media blitz, there are many moments of outright laughter throughout the film.",0
Anything Wrong With It?,0
There were a few flaws I found in Calendar Girls.,0
A few conflicts were developed that never found any resolution in the film.,1
"Of course, there is no absolute necessity to wrap everything up neatly by the end of an hour and a half, but it is nice to see at least the beginnings of a resolution on most of the issues.",1
"One particular storyline involving Chris's son does provide a few comedy and a few drama moments, but peters out, or is lost in the wash of the story's climax.",0
The other small complaint I could express regards the Hollywood furor that develops around the Knapely women.,0
"This segment of the film, while funny at times, devolves into a not-too-subtle critique of Hollywood and the television industry.",0
"I'm all for critiquing the establishment, by the way, but to my mind, transferring the movie's action to L.A. stripped away some of the English charm that had attended it to that point.",0
"That said, it doesn't by any means ruin the film.",0
I just found that portion to be a bit more forced than the rest.,0
Final Thoughts,0
Calendar Girls is quite simply an all-around enjoyable film.,0
"The acting is solid, the premise is believable ( good thing, as it's based on a true story ), and the whole experience is rife with humor.",0
The few flaws hardly detract from the general sense of enjoyment engendered by the movie.,0
"Even if this kind of film isn't your cup of tea, think about renting it when it hits your local video store.",1
It's definitely worth seeing if you're home for a quiet evening.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot.,0
The juxtaposition of the words British and comedy  is enough to strike fear into the hearts of even the hardiest cinema-goer.,0
"However, Calendar Girls  proves to be a rather impressive exception to the norm.",0
"The film is based on the real-life events from a Yorkshire village a few years ago, although the Director was keen on maintaining that the individual characters in the film are not themselves based on the real-life women.",1
"Calendar Girls  centres on the Knapeley Womens Institute, a clan of Yorkshire women who meet every week to sing and receive talks on thrilling matters such as carpets and broccoli.",0
"Annie ( Julie Walters ) and Chris ( Helen Mirren ) are long-standing friends who faithfully turn-up, despite the soporific subject matter.",0
"When Annies husband dies from leukaemia, the effervescent Chris comes up with the idea of the WI raising money for a new sofa in the hospital in Johns memory.",0
"Thanks to some creative inspiration from her sons soft-porn magazine and big-breasted dolly-bird on the wall of the local bicycle repair shop, she comes up with the idea of a nude calendar.",0
"Whilst most of the group are initially reluctant, the fifty-something middle-class folk are gradually talked round into stripping off ( nude, not naked, Annie is keen to point out ), with their biblical parts ( or front bottoms  if you like ) carefully concealed behind implements traditionally associated with the WI.",1
"However, none of them could imagine the impact that the calendar would have over the coming weeks, as it transcends them to superstar status way beyond their village.",1
"However, as Hollywood beckons, relationships begin to suffer ",0
Many films based on fact have a tendency to be over-the-top and skew stories so that they are barely recognisable.,0
"However, it s the films ability to maintain the earthy northern wit and its subtle comedy which really makes it into a winner.",0
"The northerness and nudity inevitably leads it to be compared to The Full Monty, but its quirks differentiate it from its predecessor and there does not appear to be an intention to mimic.",1
"Mirren and Walters, surely two of the most talented British actresses of their generation, give great performances and bounce off each other beautifully, easily switching from comedy to drama when required without being hammy and trying too hard.",1
"It is particularly interesting that Mirren, best known for her ice-maiden Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect is the bubblier, more outgoing of the pair whilst Walters, Mrs Overall in Acorn Antiques  is more reserved.",0
"John ( played perfectly by Alderton ) is always optimistic and upbeat during his illness, and the scenes with Anne are warm and touching rather than melancholy and melodramatic.",0
This is a refreshing change from the usual screen morbid portrayals of terminal illness on the big screen.,0
The rest of the WI is also fabulously portrayed thanks to some great performances from the cast.,0
"Annette Crosbie, Celia Imrie and Penelope Wilton all add a nice depth to their characters with some subtle touches.",0
"Complementing each other rather than any one person trying to dominate the screen, the marvellous cast match the playful script.",0
Chriss sons adolescent awkwardness at her perceived embarrassing behaviour is also quite comedic.,0
One possible criticism would be that the arguments between Anne and Chris in the later stages of the film perhaps seem a little tacked-on to try and create a mini-conflict.,0
"However, as youd imagine, it manages to resolve itself before too long and does nt detract from the overall feel-good factor.",1
"A good old-fashioned straightforward plot with the emphasis on script and characters rather than having a deep philosophical meaning, it is fantastically watchable and jam-packed with witty one-liners and should appeal to a wide ranging audience.",0
"I caught this movie on the comedy channel today, and want to find it on dvd now, for my collection.",0
"It's what I'd term the"" stupid-funny"" style, much like Mel Brooks would make.",0
"If you're one of those people that's easily offended by non""politically correct"" movies, steer clear of this one.",0
"If you're capable of laughing at the world, and especially at yourself, watch this movie!",0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.,0
I just want to be upfront on the following.,0
I still haven't forgiven Tom for what he did to Nicole.,1
To dump your wife through a divorce petition is pretty sleazy.,0
What's even sleazier is to abandon her while she's pregnant with your child and then try to say that the marriage was only enforce for 9 years 11 months so that you could skirt the 10 year California rule on split of assets.,0
It's sleazy.,0
"Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about my strong like for Tom Cruise, the actor.",0
"I've always had a soft spot for the lovable creature that he is and by the time he made Top Gun, I was swearing my undying devotion to him.",0
"I don't think that he's a particularly gifted actor however, like Britney Spears, he is the consummate entertainer.",1
I doubt that he'll ever win an Oscar for Best Actor.,0
Why?,0
"In the end, I think that his looks are what sabotage him.",0
The best thing that could happen to him is an industrial accident.,0
What does this have to do with The Last Samurai?,0
I'll get to that in a moment.,0
"Let's review the story, shall we?",0
It's 1876.,0
The movie opens up with Nathan Algren ( Tom Cruise ) sabotaging his own employment opportunities by funneling his anger and regret into a bottle of alcohol and an attitude of rebellion.,0
What's he so upset about?,0
"As a captain, he spent time fighting those savages and along the way, he massacred innocent women and children.",0
"That's enough to make any man with a conscious, drink.",0
"The Japanese government, recognizing his keen ability to get the job done, hires him to train their troops in the modern ways of war.",0
Who is the enemy?,0
"Their own people, specifically those who do not wish to see the modern ways take over their world.",1
"That effort is driven by the samurais and their honorable leader, Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe ).",0
"Algren, for the right price, takes the job on.",0
"The Japanese peasants, who make up most of the emperor's army, are ill-prepared for any type of battle.",0
"Unfortunately, the government doesn't want to hear that and despite Algren's proof, they send a group in to hold the samurais back from disturbing a railroad.",1
"After the samurais kill most of the soldiers ( the others have ran ), Algren is left to fight them off.",0
"Katsumoto, impressed and fascinated with the American, spares his life and takes him in as a prisoner.",0
Algren is housed with the family of the samurai that he killed in battle.,0
"During the process, he detoxes, and learns to appreciate life for what it is.",0
Did you think I just gave the entire movie away?,0
"Well relax, I didn't.",1
So back to this whole thing with Tom.,0
What does his appearance have to do with The Last Samurai?,0
"I felt like the entire time I was watching this movie, that Tom was miscast and had someone else been thrown into this role ( Edward Norton?",0
"Hugh Jackman? ),",0
I might have walked away liking it better.,0
He was just too pretty for the role.,0
"Even the hap-hazard beard and scruff couldn't hide his pretty-boy face and that my friends, was distracting.",0
"In addition, I felt like his acting were pretty stiff.",0
"It's like he was aiming to be""technically"" precise in everything that he did and that in turn seemed to stifle any of his emotional connections with other characters.",0
"The true gem of the film, acting wise, was Ken Watanbe.",0
He had a screen presence that I haven't seen in a long time.,0
"His charisma ( magnetic, charming, forceful, and mysterious ) is what pushed me to recommend this movie and I really wish that the entire story would have focused around him and not Tom.",1
"In fact, you could have left Tom out of this and it would have been a better picture.",0
"But of course, Tom is the box office pull SO you gotta take the good with the bad.",0
Now let's move on to two of my ( normally ) favorite producers/writers/directors in the world - Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz.,0
I fell deeply in like with them when they were at the helm of Thirtysomething.,0
I felt cheated that there was a lack of emotional bonding between the characters.,0
"I mean, there was some between Algren and Katsumoto ( but not nearly enough ) and virtually nothing but superficial ties with the rest of the characters.",1
"Although I'm thrilled that they didn't have Tom doin' everybody, I felt a little cheated about his interactions with the opposite sex.",0
This movie was too long ( I had to pee ) and very predictable in parts ( I rolled my eyes ).,0
"In addition, for a movie that didn't have enough emotional bonding, it relied a lot on melodrama to manipulate the audience.",0
See important death scenes for more details.,0
The editing together of the scenes was pretty good with the exception of the first 8-10 minutes.,0
The scenes introducing Tom's character felt very disjointed.,0
The technical aspects of the movie - from the cinematography to the battle scenes - were amazing.,0
The fight/training scenes looked real and felt real.,0
The choreography was over the top fantastic.,0
I was duly impressed.,0
The battle scenes seemed more like art than war - almost to the point of glamorization.,0
"Girls, if you strongly dislike blood and guts please know that while there is lots of blood shed, most of the scenes were not horribly gross.",1
I only closed my eyes twice that I can remember.,0
"As far as the story goes, I can't vouch to any of the historical accuracies of it so if you are one of those sticklers for factual accounts, you might want to do your research before you go.",1
"I feel a little strange giving this movie such low marks considering that it had a some of the best technical stuff I've seen in a long time, a strong score, and Ken Watanabe however, if the studios want to pull in a wider audience than just battle buffs, they need to look beyond the technical perfections and evaluate the emotional aspects of the film.",0
To recap:,0
*/SYM Movie was TOO long.,0
I had to pee but waited.,0
*/SYM Tom is too pretty for this kind of role.,0
*/SYM Ken Watanabe is a force to be reckoned with.,0
*/SYM Boys will like this more than girls.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
"The main problem with The Last Samurai is not that the plot is almost exactly the same as both Dances with Wolves  and Shogun, but that it assumes you ve seen both those movies, and cant seem to decide whether or not it thinks you want to see them again.",1
"If you ve seen both the full ten hours of Shogun, and the version where the mini-series is reduced to approximately the length of a feature film, you ve got some idea of whats going in The Last Samurai, and you know that somehow the whole point is lost in the trimming.",0
You might similarly imagine the version of Dances with Wolves  that has an hour or so cut out of it.,0
"Now, if you have nt seen either of those films things get a little harder to explain.",1
Imagine a book whose main purpose is to explore a culture ( to some degree or other ) by way of having an outsider suddenly thrust into it.,0
"Now imagine that instead of actually having a book like Shogun, with all its details about the culture relayed through the story and the character, you only have the Cliffs Notes of the book which just says, and he explores and comes to know the Japanese culture, and the ways, ideas, and ideals of the Samurai. ",0
Its left to you then to either be able to get something out of that line or not.,1
"Even all this does nt get you to the point that you can really connect with where The Last Samurai is going, because though Dances  and Shogun werent true stories, there was a decent truth  in them.",1
"They were fictional stories that attempted to take place in real times, and portray cultures ( to some extent ) as they really were.",0
"The Last Samurai is one step removed here, because it is nt a fictional story in that sense.",1
"The historically incorrect things Samurai does are enough to change the entire situation of Japan itself, and change the entire culture to a degree.",0
"Were not across the line into something like alternate-reality sci-fi, but were approaching it.",1
"The result is still a trip into the world of Samurai, but it s a trip that says, youve already seen Shogun, so we dont need to go into all that again, and were going down this other road anyway. ",0
"All that said, there are only two things keeping this movie from being not only five stars, but also an instant classic; it s ending ( and I mean the entire last thirty minutes ), and its absolute lack of daring.",1
"Instead of daring, I might actually say its lack of honor ( to itself ), but that is a jaunt toward irony I choose to avoid.",0
"You probably have a good guess at the story based on the comparisons Ive made, and you cant be far off.",0
"Captain Nathan Algren ( Tom Cruise ), veteran of the Civil War, and many skirmishes with Indians, is hired to go to Japan and train an army.",0
"He learns that he is there to put down a certain Samurai, Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe ), and his followers.",0
"Pressured to lead his new troops before theyre ready, he is captured by Katsumoto in the eventual miserable rout his army  suffers.",0
"He spends a long winter with Katsumoto and his family in a small village, because Katsumoto wants to know his enemy.",0
"Once we get beyond how Algren finds his way into the Samurai world, Shogun takes over, complete with a Japanese woman he can grow to love, and surprise night attack by Ninja.",0
"From here we mix equal parts Dances  and Shogun, choosing those elements that best serve the scenario weve created, and we have our plot.",0
"These three movies may have another connection, because if Kevin Costner, Richard Chamberlain, and Tom Cruise ever did anything right, it was their respective roles in these movies.",0
"Ive never been a Cruise fan, and even now he feels like an odd choice for the role to me, but he manages it far better than Id have predicted he could.",1
Thats not to say hes perfect.,1
"Theres still quite a bit of the Hollywood star coming through in his performance, but hes not horrible, and certainly delivers something at least more watchable than his norm.",1
"Ken Watanabe, on the other hand, is wonderful.",0
"He delivers a quiet power, and undeniable presence that make you wish all the more that the film came through on its potential.",0
"There are a few brilliantly crafted scenes in which Katsumoto is in the background, off-center, and not exactly doing anything.",1
"He is still the absolute center of the scene, and your attention.",0
"Its hard to avoid the natural comparison to Shogun here, because though they are very different characters, Watanabe is basically playing Mifunes Shogun role.",0
Thats the sort of situation where a comparison can spring to mind unbidden and wreak unfair havoc with your impression of an actors performance.,0
Not so here.,1
"While Watanabe is nt quite going to stand up to a real comparison to Mifune, hes strong enough to at least make such a comparison a respectable question.",0
"Mentioning Costner, oddly enough, leads me to the cinematography by Oscar-winner John Toll.",0
"Thats because Samurai reminded me so much of James Muros first effort earlier this year, Open Range.",0
"From a cinematography stand-point, theyre practically the same movie.",0
"Theyre beautiful, but it s a very easy sort of beauty.",0
"Panoramic views of rolling plains and hills, sunrises with a hint of cloud cover, and sweeping shots of virgin forest, are not exactly on the cover of  Whats New and Exciting in Beautiful Pictures Monthly.",1
"Its gorgeous, sure, but it s not exactly doing anything.",1
"The difference is that when youre making a fairly simple cowboy film whose greatest asset is the fact that it does nt take itself too seriously, that s just the sort of thing that works.",0
"But, when youre making a semi-massive epic that puts itself out as having some definite goals, and definitely takes itself very seriously, well..., then it s just a giant-name cinematographer cashing his check and going home early.",0
All of this likely gives an impression which makes my rating confusing.,0
"I blame that on expectations, and perhaps a slightly unusual version of them.",0
The mediocre hopes I had for this film built to high hopes as the movie actually progressed before my eyes.,0
At about the halfway mark I was very hopeful indeed.,0
"I mentioned that there were two things keeping this from being a five-star movie, and this is where those come into play.",0
"It has no real daring to it, even though the first half will lead you to expect some.",1
"Once were a certain amount of the way in ( and even before that really, but you tend to overlook it in the earliest stages of a film ) we realize that everything is given to you in the simplest possible terms, with the least amount of effort, as easily  as can be managed.",0
The other thing keeping the movie from being five-star status is its deplorable ending.,0
An ending that is so typically Hollywood that it does its best to negate all that comes before it.,0
"Its stagy, and manages to avoid being described as formulaic only based on the uninteresting technicality that no ones used the formula before.",1
"Still, Im probably giving a very negative impression of everything to do with this movie that I give four stars ( out of five ).",0
"I focus on the negatives, because far too many people are going to sing this movies praises far too much.",0
"It does nt really deserve many nominations, much less the wins it s somewhat likely to receive.",1
"Nevertheless, it s still above-average in my opinion, and though it has a lot going against it, it has a lot going for it as well.",0
"Cruise is nt great, but I have to admit that he is nt bad, and Watanabe alone made it worth it to me.",0
"Its certainly entertaining, and has some decent action moments that are actually relevantly connected to the plot.",0
"I may have said that it s an easy  sort of beautiful, but that does nt negate the fact that it is actually beautiful.",0
It even has a pretty good story.,0
The end result is that I think it s worth your money at the theater.,0
"Its greatly disappointing in ways, but it s the kind of disappointment that can only come from having such great potential.",0
"Ive always been easy on movies that try to do something excellent and fail, and Im not of a mind to change that now.",1
"I should qualify that, because the question of whether or not the creators were actually trying to do something excellent ( as opposed to something that would win awards ) is open to debate, and frankly, Im not sure which side Im on.",1
"Whatever the case may be there, lets just say that something excellent almost happened.",0
"At the end of the movie, Captain Algren has a final conversation with the Emperor of Japan that curiously relays my ultimate feelings on the movie.",0
"The Emperor asks Algren to do something, and Algren responds by telling him to do something else.",0
"Its actually a great line, though it is a line that only fits a far better version of the movie.",0
"The conversation fits my feelings about the movie, because I thought this was going to be a movie about Algrens response, but it turns out it was only about the Emperors initial quesiton.",0
"OK, I'm not going to lie to you here.",1
I was pretty disappointed with movie in general after watching Bad Boys II on Wednesday night.,0
It was the kind of movie that makes you rethink whether you ever want to see another movie.,0
"I quickly ran out to the local theater to catch The Last Samurai, lest I allow Michael Bay to achieve his ultimate goal of driving movie lovers back to their TV sets ( I've determined that has to be the explanation for the Bruckheimer/Bay relationship...the less people go to the movies, the more that can be at home tuning into CSI and Cold Case ).",0
"I'd heard the hype, I'm not opposed to Tim Cruise in general ( even if I did waste seven dollars seeing Vanilla Sky in theaters ), and I went under the impression that after the travesty I'd just seen in Bad Boys II, anything out there would probably be look like Citizen Kane in comparison.",1
What I saw instead was an actual contender for best movie of 2003 honors.,0
"The Last Samurai is a""historical"" epic set in the 1870's, as Japan started to move towards joining the ways of the modern ( Western ) world.",0
"As the old ways started to clash with the new ones, the new emperor decides to enlist experts in the Western ways, including Captain Nathan Algren ( played by the aforementioned Tom Cruise ) of the US Army.",0
"Algren, a soldier who's personal demons has driven him to hard times, is brought in to train the Japanese military in the ways of modern warfare.",0
"Mind you, this shouldn't be all that hard, as the military is using guns, while the opposing force of Samuria warriors is using bows, arrows and swords.",0
"Unforturately for Algren, the Japanese leaders disregard his concerns of their readiness, and send their unprepared forces into battle.",0
"Three minutes late, the military is defeated, and Algren is a captive of the"" savages"".",0
"Wounded and in the hands of the enemy, Algren is surprised by the relative kindness he is shown.",0
"Slowly but surely, he begins to know and love the ways of the Samurai, eventually turning his back on his former ways and comrades.",0
"Without revealing any more about the movie, I'll just note that I was mildly dissatisfied with the Hollywood ending to the movie.",1
I felt the story could have gone in a better direction ( is that vague enough for you? ).,0
"Ok, let's get started off by saying this is easily one of the top movies of the year.",0
"As a matter of fact, I'd go so far as to say it's the best movie that I have seen so far this year ( mind you, the top two critically acclaimed films of the year, Cold Mountain and Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, have yet to be released ).",0
"Now people who have read my reviews before will know that just last week, I was heaping praise upon Master and Commander.",0
Here's why The Last Samurai is a better picture: Master and Commander is a good movie carried by a great performance by Russell Crowe; Last Samurai is a great film complimented by a great performance by Tom Cruise.,0
"Speaking of Cruise, when he decide not to suck?",1
"This is probably his most challenging role of his career, and he proved that he was more up to the task.",0
Cruise seemed to immerse himself in the role like I can't remember him ever doing before.,1
We watch him transform from a drunkard haunted by his past to a warrior who has found peace and redemption for the life he has led.,0
"Now while I'm read to throw the guy an Oscar nomination right now, it might just be due to the fact that I've come to expect far less out of him.",0
"Regardless, I wouldn't be far off if I said this is one of the his greatest performances.",0
"The rest of the cast is phenomenal, but none greater than Ken Watanabe.",1
"Watanabe plays Katsumoto, the leader of the remaining Samurai who captures and later befriends Captain Algren.",0
"If anyone in the movie gave a better performance than Cruise, it was him.",0
"Throw in a slew of other top performances, and you have quite a nice little pic.",0
"What really made this movie for me, though, was its pace and flow.",0
"Never slow and never boring, director Edward Zwick manages to find that rare balance between action and drama that all directors strive for, but rarely attain.",1
"It's very hard to keep an audience interested in a 144 minute movie from start to finish, but with a stellar storyline and breath-taking scenery, Last Samurai achieves that goal in spades.",0
"On a scale of one to five, Last Samurai is a seven.",0
"This movie gets two thumbs way up from me, and should be in the serious running for an Oscar nomination ( with LOTR:ROTK the clear favorite to win every major award in the world this year, I think a nom is the best that can be hoped for ).",0
"I give this movie the highest recommendation, and can lock Last Samurai in as a guaranteed top three movie of the year.",0
Go see this movie.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.,0
"Admittedly, I was concerned about this film beforehand.",0
"While I think Tom Cruise is one of the best mega-star actors Hollywood has to offer, I was concerned that The Last Samurai could do for him what Braveheart did for Mel Gibson and Gladiator did for Russell Crowe: swell their egos past their abilities.",0
"Thankfully, this film works well enough by its own right that it does nt have to keep Cruise in the limelight all the time; and hes quite happy to have it that way.",1
The movie is respectful enough of its subject matter not to put all the glory around its central character and that is what helps this movie to shine.,1
The Last Samurai tells the story of Capt.,0
"Nathan Algren ( Cruise ), a courageous American soldier who is plagued by the guilt of a slaughter of innocent Indians ordered by his commanding officer.",0
"Using whats left of his fame to sell Winchester rifles, Algren spends his days in solitude drowning in a bottle.",0
"That is, until he gets an offer from the Japanese government for $ 500 per week to train their soldiers to fight against a band of Samurai who have rebelled against their quest for modernization.",0
But it is only after his band of hastily trained soldiers is attacked and Algren is captured by the rebels that he learns of their true fight: to preserve their way of life that is being threatened by western civilization.,0
"Through contact with these enemies  he is able to learn of honor, value and love.",0
"Im sure the cynics will say a movie like this throws the audience into melodrama, but theyll likely say the same about any film in which we are expected to genuinely care about the characters.",0
"Cruise is a fine lead actor, never stealing the spotlight, but always commanding enough presence for us to believe the film.",1
"And while I was nt always buying him as a genuine Samurai, he throws himself into the role with such determination that he deserves to be commended for his efforts, despite the fact that he is a Hollywood megastar ( which is hard to see past, regardless of how good the performance is. )",1
"Katsumoto, The leader of the Samurai village, is played with an Oscar-worthy performance by Ken Wanatabe, and is easily the films best character.",0
"He is a fierce, honorable warrior, but also a loving leader who seeks to understand that which is outside his culture.",0
"Of the films villains, I cant be so praiseworthy.",0
"While they do work fine in the framework of the story, they are the same static antagonists we see in every film like this, where their lust for progress  gets in the way of human dignity, although, perhaps this can be blamed on the story itself.",0
"Dont get me wrong, the story is great.",1
"It works perfectly for the film, because this is a character drama and a war epic, not a story-driven film.",1
"There is no need for an overly complex plot, because what were expected to be drawn to here is these people and why theyre so willing to fight for what they believe in.",1
"It may not be wholly original at all, but it works.",1
And that s all that matters.,0
"That being said, the film settles into that mold and shines beautifully.",0
The environments here are breathtaking.,0
The valley where the Samurai village resides is quite possibly one of the most beautiful set pieces in cinematic history.,0
Its citizens are well portrayed as well.,0
"These are not savage warriors as the early goings of the film would have us believe, but they are families, fathers fighting to give their children some tradition to cherish.",1
"The costumes are spot on, especially the Samurai armor.",0
"When we first meet them thundering through terrestrial mists on horseback, it truly is a fearsome sight.",0
"The film is beautifully scored, from the soft pieces of quiet reflection to the epic pieces of battle, and is probably one of the only soundtracks so far this year that might be worth buying ( Return of the King being the exception ).",0
Hans Zimmer captures everything good about the film and translates it musically.,0
"And the fight scenes, oh the fight scenes!",0
Wow!,0
The film is intensely violent and has a body count that could rival even Kill Bill.,0
"Its not simply all out war, but it s stylistic in its approach as well.",1
"The film has one-on-one sword fighting, finding a windswept and rain-soaked Cruise continually training himself in the way of the Samurai.",0
There is a carefully plotted final battle that does nt cheat the viewer by simply having the soldiers run out and kill each other.,1
"The Samurai fight for their honor against thousands of Japanese infantry, and the battle is simply spectacular.",0
It is perfectly shot and perfectly directed to an emotional resonance not often found outside something like Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings.,1
Zwick even respects the intelligence of the viewer by knowing the importance of military strategy in battle.,0
"It is a truly epic thing to see, with characters we have come to care for fighting for everything they believe.",0
Theres even a scene with Samurai VS Ninjas!,0
It does nt get much better than that.,1
And you can quote me that the final battle here is epic enough that it could rival even Pellannor Fields in Return of the King,0
"Amidst the battle scenes are long moments of quiet reflection, light humor, and poignant dialogue, all of which serve to draw us further into the story and connect emotionally with the characters.",0
"Cruise trains fiercely with the town warriors, refusing to stop until he can no longer move, and earning the respect of the villagers.",1
"He becomes a friend to the people, and a father figure to the village children.",0
"In short, he realizes that these people are not the bad guys.",1
Theyre noble men of good character who only wish to preserve that which they have grown to love.,0
"Katsumoto says to Nathan on the dawn of battle, You think a man can change his destiny?  to which Cruise replies,  I believe a man does what he can, until his destiny is revealed. ",0
Good stuff.,0
The Last Samurai is an epic action film that has a heart and a brain.,0
"There is intelligence, emotion, humor, and style.",0
"It slows down to let us connect with its characters, and then it throws those characters into a visual orgy of blood and carnage.",0
"The movie conveys the strength of the Samurai and the honor they live by, and the beauty of the ancient Japanese culture.",0
Everything about this film is beautiful and I would go as far as to rank it one of the years best films.,0
Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.,0
I will not rest until I get the word out this is one of the best movies out for 2003!,1
"It is not quite perfect, but is the only film I've seen since X2 that succeeds on almost every level it set out to attain.",1
"As I'm not the first review here, everyone should know the story by now.",1
Cruise is a Civil War hero who drowns his sins liquor every chance he can from the atrocities he has seen and done to the Native Americans.,0
"He gets hired to train a new""western"" style army for the Emperor of Japan, but gets captured after a failed first attempt at defeating the Samurai rebellion.",0
From there...you'll just have to see the movie!,0
Honestly I have been looking forward to this movie for about a year.,0
"I forced my reluctant wife ( who had no interest ) to see it, and she left the theatre happily surprised.",1
For me who had such high expectations this did not disappoint.,1
"The story, I must say, is fictional.",0
So please disregard all those'not historically correct' complaints you may read.,0
"The director has said upfront they tried to be extremely accurate on all things for that era, but the story is not a true one.",1
"Yes it does have its predictable moments, but for me this did not distract from enjoying an epic tale.",1
Costumes will win an Oscar.,0
These are by far the most exquiste creations I've seen all year.,0
Of course I'm talking about the Samurai armor first and foremost.,0
"Although we see Cruise's on all the promotional material, his is not the best you've seen yet.",1
"Acting wise, Cruise stays on top of his game, no I don't think it is"" Oscar-worthy"" despite the amount of training he did for the role, but he really hasn't been better.",1
"My 3 favorite performances of his were from Jerry Maguire, Minority Report, and Interview with the Vampire, and this movie falls right in line.",0
He does perform a good character transition from his tortured past to his appreciation and earnest learning of the Samurai way.,0
"Many of the other supporting characters were also very good, but I could see Ken Watanabe being nominated as he delivers a wide range from a warrior's strength to a father's compassion.",0
"There were plenty of masterfully crafted ( physical ) special effects, but were there any visual effects?",0
I honestly couldn't say.,0
"Yes, most certainly, but they are so well conceived I felt I've seen the first action (epic )movie that looked entirely real and natural....in a long time.",0
How can I not be blow away from the intense battle scenes!,1
"We have Samurai in full gear fighting, we have Ninjas!",0
( Yes as lethal as you can imagine. ),0
Never have you seen the Samurai sword wielded with such amazing skill...by everyone in this film.,1
The choreography of these fights (especially the opening attack and Ninja raid ) are breathtaking.,0
"Actually as"" cool"" as this can be, the grisly deaths should leave you feeling a bit uneasy about what it means to kill another person and how utterly horrible war can be and the devestation it leaves, unless you're completely de-sensitized.",0
Last but not least I shouldn't forget to mention the gorgeous cinematagraphy and score.,1
"Here we see more, and new beautiful venues of the New Zealand.",0
"I truly believe I was looking at ancient Japan, as it once was.",0
If anything go see the movie just to witness its jaw-dropping landscapes!,0
I am a big fan of Hans Zimmer as I have both his Black Hawk Down and Gladiator scores.,0
He does such a well job of blending in the grand with the eclectic you always get something new for each endeavor.,0
Here will be the next soundtrack I purchase.,0
For the first time in awhile I actually experienced the music in a film as much as the film itself.,0
"The main theme had the spirit of a Gladiator or Last of the Mohicans, but obviously with a Far East influence.",0
"It was a lush, rich, emotionally charged piece of music.",0
The one caveat I had is the ending.,0
"It lost the movie momentum, felt wishy-washy and rushed to clear up all possible lose ends of the story.",0
"The writers didn't know how to properly close it so they stamped it with the all too typical""hollywood hero"" end.",1
Spoiler.,0
Skip ahead now!,0
Begin Rant...,0
"How ridiculous is it every Samurai gets killed on the battlefield except Algren, especially when they let loose the heavy artillery on the charging Samurai.",0
"Pretty lame the way he only gets hit a few times, and I would say minor recoverable wounds at best, in relation to every other warrior getting riddled with lethal hits.",0
End Rant...,0
End Spoiler,0
"Regardless of a couple faults this is one of the most beautifully shot, emotionally-invested, incredibly detailed movie of the year.",0
"Reviewers Note: I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I was allowed, 1/2 star deduction for the ending.",0
Edited ( 12/12/03 ) to correct the mistakes in my rant after a 2nd viewing.,0
"If you've been alive for the last 15 years or so, you would have at some point encountered MC Hammer's smash hit single U Can't Touch This.",0
"Based upon the bass guitar riff from Superfreak, the jivey little number was a massive hit worldwide, and was once voted the greatest song of the 1980's.",0
"It appears to appeal to just about everybody: no matter which audience I play it to, it seems to go down well amongst everybody.",1
"Accompanying this ditty was the album Please Hammer Don't Hurt Em, in which MC Hammer takes a stand against all the issues of the day.",0
"Basically, this is the quintessential rap album of the age.",0
"In the liner notes, as with most of the disc, he rants about racial discrimination and a mixed bag of other capitalist society flaws.",0
"Even when the album gets cheesily bad, it's still fun in a very 80's way.",0
"You will find yourself grooving to songs you know you hate, just for the retro effect.",0
"In the fun little intro Here Comes The Hammer, he raps about the album you're about to experience in what is basically the bridge to U Can't Touch This.",0
"After that track comes the slow moving romantic number Have You Seen Her?, the only one of it's type on the album.",0
"Yo!! Sweetness with a rather redundant second exclamation mark, is a very beat-heavy ( hell, the whole album is beat-heavy ) track with men chanting about a sweetness  across the room.",0
"On Your Face, Dancing Machine, Pray, Crime Story and Black Is Black are exactly the same: like Janet Jackson in Rhythm Nation 1814, MC Hammer complains about all the difficulties facing modern Western society, racial discrimination in particular, to way too many beats and fairly crappy lyrics.",0
He even contributes a series of preachy poems to the booklet about these topics.,0
Shes Soft And Wet and Work This are also the same: Theres a girl.,0
"Shes hot, eh? Yes, she is.",0
She certaintly is.,0
Let me explain why this is so.,0
"So, should you buy Please Hammer, Dont Hurt Em?",0
"While it s one of the essential rap albums of the day, it comes across very dated and cheesy, so No.",1
"However, if you can get your hands on Please Hammer at garage sale prices, or a single of U Cant Touch This, make sure to pick it up: Cant Touch is a must-have for every music collection!",0
#NAME?,0
"Remix albums are usually pointless exercises by a record company to bleed loads of money out of unsuspecting fans and into pockets of artists-and moreso, the labels themselves.",0
"Since the remix album exploded in 1989-90 with the likes of Bobby Brown, Paula Abdul and the New Kids, there haven't been many remix albums that are not average, at best.",1
"Now St. Louis rapper nelly joins the fray with his clunkily titled"" The Derrty Versions: The Reinvention"".",0
This is basically a souped-up greatest hits album.,0
"While some of his hits enjoy a slight adjustment in beat, none of these songs is extraordinarily different than te original version, which is a good and a bad thing.",1
"If you're a Nelly fan, you're getting jerked out of your money to get a buncha stuff you already own.",0
"If you're like me and think the man has a couple of hot singles, it's an OK buy because it means you don't have to buy either of his middling-to-weak albums.",1
"I'll be the first to admit I'm not a Nelly hater, but he grew on me very slowly.",1
"I respect the dude because he has his own style, and he's not afraid to admit that he's not the greatest MC in the world, but he has his own little niche.",1
"Of course, his success far outweights his artistry, but how many artists can we say that of?",0
"hey, the dude wants to make you dance, he's relatively inoffensive, he doesn't traffic into the super-violent and misogynist cliches that most other popular MC's fall into.",1
"Hey, no one will ever confuse him with Rakim, but he's OK, damn it.",1
Some of the remixes leave very little unchanged from the original version.,0
""" Country Grammar"", Nelly's breakout hit, is exactly the same as the original version with one minor alteration in the chorus as well as a verse from E-40, the hip-hop king of""what the f*** is that dude saying?"".",0
""" Dilemma"" and"" Work It"" add slightly harder beats ( courtesy of Jermaine Dupri and Scott Storch ) respectively.",0
"JD brings up Nelly's vocal, which is almost buried into the mix on"" Dilemma's"" studio version, while Nelly alters his flow on"" Work It"", which was originally a pretty decent party anthem but now is only interesting because of Justin Timberlake's best Michael Jackson impression to date.",0
""" E.I."" is remixed by crunk king David Banner, and Banner's rock-etched production is the standout on a couple of tracks here.",0
"He takes it back to the old-school Rick Rubin Casio-drumbeat and loud guitar days on this one, despite its' somewhat sexist refrain of""is that yo' a** cuz it ain't yo face"" plastered throughout the song.",0
"For whatever reason, it appears twice on this set.",0
"The album's two best songs are the most chilled-out tracks here, giving Nelly more of an RandB than a hip-hop vibe.",0
""" Pimp Juice"" coasts along on a jazz-kissed soul background with some sultry sax and a guest vocal by the legendary Ron Isley.",0
""" Groovin' Tonight"" is all about Brian McKnight's great guest vocal.",0
"You almost forget that there's rapping on this track ( not to mention a samle of the opening drumbeat of Michael Jackson's"" Rock With You"" ).",1
"However, that's about it for the good stuff here.",0
"The Neptunes severely bland"" If"" segues into an unnecessary remix of"" Hot In Herre"".",0
"Originally produced by The""tunes also, this remix is helmed by Nelly's in-house production team, and doesn't really change the song a whole lot.",1
""" Ride Wit Me"" is the weirdest remix of all.",0
"How many hip-hop albums do you know that feature a shout out to my"" n*gga John Mayer""?",0
"This reconstruction liberally lifts from mayer's breakout hit"" No Such Thing"", and while it's weird to hear Nelly twisting the melody of Mayer's hit, some experiments are best left untried.",0
This album also loses cool points for the annoying-*ss interview skits that appear throughout the album.,0
"Altogether, this is a decidedly average effort.",0
"Neither of Nelly's two studio albums is exactly a classic, so I actually recommend this album to folks who want the hit singles without wanting to spring for"" Country Grammar"" and""nellyville"".",1
"These songs aren't so radically changed that you'll miss the original versions-well, not most of'em anyway.",1
Buy this only if you own nothing else by Nelly and want his hit singles.,0
Rating: 2 1/2 stars.,0
"Key tracks:"" Pimp Juice"" f/Ron Isley,"" Groovin' Tonight"" f/St.",0
"Lunatics and Brian McKnight,"" Dilemma"" f/Jermaine Dupri and Kelly Rowland",0
"For the past 2 years, the Neptunes team of Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams have plagued the commercial music industry like cancer.",0
"Theyve produced a countless amount of hits for not only hip-hop artists, but have crossed over into RandB and pop and supplied their futurisitic beats for other artists in other genres.",1
"Both usually stand behind the boards, but Pharrell Williams has grown accustomed to singing hooks for acts such as The Clipse, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, and Ludacris.",0
"Pharrell Williams is talented to me and his voice is great for hip-hop / RandB, but a bit too commercial.",0
"Anyways, recently the Neptunes have released a compilation of new beats with the so-called""hottest"" rappers out there, an album entitled Clones.",0
"Even though these guys are relatively good behind the boards, they dont bring anything new to the table and are extremely repetitive, not to mention their choice of rappers for this album is... in a word.. poor.",1
"The real name of this album shoud've been"" The Neptunes Present... CRAP"".",0

"Admittedly, a lot of the beats on this album are well-produced, and this would be a perfectly competent album if the Neptunes did one of two things, get better lyricists or provide just instrumentals.",0
"A lot of the songs are heavy on production, featuring some unique production and great new sounds found by the Neptunes, but with poor subject matter and lyrics, which brings Clones down for people who favor lyrics over beats.",0
"A perfect example of this is Busta Rhymes second single"" Light Your A** on Fire"".",0
"The beat, though clubbish, features some new sounds.",0
"The bongo drums mixed with claps are in a somewhat different assortment, giving it a unique echo which ive rarely heard on a hip-hop track.",0
"However, Busta Rhymes comes off as terrible, proving to me once again that his best moments are far behind him.",0
He spits nonsensical commercial dribble about booty-dancing and clubbish themes.,0
I would light my a** on fire literally than listen to this... ( HERE WE GO!!!! ),0
"Of course, if this is a Neptunes album, you know The Clipse is gonna pop in there more than once.",0
"Their first track is"" Blaze of Glory"".",0
"Plain and Simple, i just cannot stand this song.",1
"The beat is terrible, featuring a completely off-balance medley of bass, synthesizer, and trumpets which sound completely terrible.",0
"The rappers on this track are less than average, as Clipse once again tries their very best to hit us with dope rhymes, but fails miserably.",0
"Ab-Liva is a tiny bit better, with a small multi-syllable flow at times and a couple of dope punches, but nothing special.",0
"The song tries too hard to be aggressive, but it sounds terrible.",0
Skip it...,0
""" It Wasn't Us"" is a pure club piece of trash.",0
"Ludacris is usually humorous on the mic, but on this track hes missing out on his normally memorable punches.",0
"The beat is just too damn clubbish, with the Neptunes over-use of synthesizers, adding a unique whistling sound.",0
"Ill give the Neptunes credit, they can definetely be innovative and creative, but at times this leads to annoying clubbish beats, and im sure the Neptunes are capable of more, it sort of saddens me.",0
"I find it rather humorous that the first dope track on this album isn't even a hip-hop track, but an RandB track.",0
"Pharrell hits us with his solo jam and lead-single"" Frontin"".",0
"Pharrell has an excellent RandB singing voice, as he has the ability to raise and lower the pitch of his voice, but usually stays high.",0
"The track sounds a tiny bit too much like a Justin Timberlake song, but it still hits the spot.",0
"Pharrell's smooth RandB vocals, the dope and soothing Neptunes production, and Jay-Z's short, but on-point flow make this track an excellent one and actually one of the highlights of Clones.",0
"If the album were loaded with more songs like this, it would be a more than worthy purchase.",1
"Im usually against producers making records, but Pharrell has enough talent to make it far without selling-out.",1
"Unfortunately, by just having a look at the track list, you can tell that its too late for that.",0
"We go from good RandB to absolutely awful RandB with"" Good Girl"".",0
"Vanessa Marquez sings over superb Neptunes production, but her voice is just... terrible, at least on this song.",0
"The song has a more poppy feel to it, sounding like a Britney Spears song, but i personally can't stand the premise or the vocals of this song, making it somewhat unlistenable.",1
"Even though the beat isn't bad whatsoever, it might fit better for Pharrell to sing over it and not this b*tch.",1
"Everybody knows i hate Nelly, but im not biased.",1
"However, as expected"" If"" is terrible.",0
The sad thing is that the beat is rather good.,0
"The Neptunes provide Nelly a very dope piano and synthesized beat, which reminds me of early Playstation music, but it sounds very good.",0
"However, Nelly's choppy flow, terribly commercialized lyrics, and lack of vocabulary kill any momentum the track could've had.",0
Nelly raps mysogonystic commercialism with terrible rhymes and his typical sing-song bullsh*t.,0
"His lyrics bring the song all the way down to a 0 Star Rating, but the beat puts it at 1 Star.",0
"Newly signed Star Trak artist Roscoe P. Goldchain gets a joint with a few other members of the Neptunes label on"" Hot"".",0
"The beat is very simplistic, unique, and seemingly unheard of.",0
"Featuring a scratch snare, some very low chimes, and a simple drum loop with no bass, the atmosphere is seemingly non-existant and the song is low, im guessing so that the emcees could flex their vocal muscles.",1
"Admittedly, some of the lyrics on this track are indeed dope, but their refusal to remain on subject sort of pulls it down, besides the fact that their lyrics are average as expected.",0
"The main event here though is the abstract production, which is something that ive honestly never heard, making it sound as if somebody vocally scratched these noises in a cypher, which is a unique feel.",1
"I suggest checking this song out if you can just to hear the beat, or lack-there-of a beat.",0
"Commercial Sell-Out Snoop Dogg pops up here on"" It Blows My Mind"" as he returns to rapping about nothing, except himself.",0
"Snoop does his sort of charismatic flow which everybody knows, and his rhymes are below average, but not as terrible as i thought they would be.",1
But its nothing special whatsoever as he once again proves why his best days are far behind him.,0
"The beat however, is extraordinarily unique, as always.",0
"The Neptunes give us a thumping echoing drum with some chimes in the background, and seemingly no bass, except for what the drum gives it.",1
"The chorus is done by Pharrell im guessing, and its sort of catchy, but probably not enough for a commercial single.",1
Message for Snoop: RETIRE!!!!! RETIRE!!!!! RETIRE NOW!!!!!,0
Spymob is... rock.,0
"I heard that the Neptunes signed a rock group onto their label, but i had no clue it was on here.",1
"Well, to me"" Half-Steering"" is typical punk-sounding with rock lyrics.",0
"The guitar rift is alright, but nothing special.",0
"Im not a big fan of punk music, but i do know good music when i hear it, and this is not good music to me.",1
"Even though one riveting part on the song with the violins is dope, the rest of it is sort of mediocre to me.",0
"If you bought this album for the hip-hop, the skip this, along with the High Speed track"" F*ckin Spend"".",0
"In my opinion, the High Speed track is a lot better, with a louder vocalist and a pounding guitar rift.",0
"This is good rock music, but nothing extraordinary, and a bit too short.",0
Im guessing that the Neptunes wanted to give previews of their new rock acts coming out on Star Trak.,0
Well there ya go.,0
"N.E.R.D. return on"" Loser"".",0
"N.E.R.D. team up with Clipse for a very pseudo-rock sounding track, which sounds like a freakin punk song at the start, with a guitar rift, melodic vocals, and seemingly a steel drum.",0
"After listening to the track we get to The Clipse flow, which is actually not too bad and they manage to fit within the music in the background.",1
"This track is more of a rock-rap mixture, and not just hip-hop music.",1
"Ill give the Neptunes credit, they are great at experimenting with new styles and blending styles and being creative, but they need to knock out the commercial crap.",0
"I suggest skipping"" Rock n Roll"".",0
"Even though the beat is worth listening to, the rapper Fam-Lay is the worst emcee ive heard thusfar on this album, yes hes worse than Nelly.",0
"Fam-Lay's lyrics are among the worst ever, as he spits uninspired, whack-a** lyrics, with a vocabulary matching that of an unborn child, and a choppy flow.",0
"Fam-Lay raps about money and drugs as every rapper does, but he sounds just terrible.",0
"This is the pure definition of commercial rap in my honest opinion, and i simply hate it.",0
This is terrible.,0
I'd rather watch Golf than listen to this...,0
""" The Don of the Dons"" is terrible.",0
"First, we get a fake-a** Sean Paul rapping his unlistenable jamaican lyrics, and Jadakiss giving us a relatively dope performance.",0
"However, both these vocalists are brung down by bad production.",0
There is simply too much going on in the background.,0
"The funky guitar doesn't match with the synthesizers whatsoever, and the track sounds a bit funny production-wise.",0
"Personally myself, i would not stick this into my cd player.",1
"Fans of The Clipse should recognize"" Hot Damn"".",0
"This track was originally on the Lord Willin' album, but this is the clean remixed version.",0
"The lyrics are altered, as well as the chorus.",0
"The beat thankfully stays the same, with that epic piano and trumpet medley which is definetely head-knodding and one of the best Neptunes beat ever.",0
"The lyrics in my opinion, are watered-down on this version, with less memorable punchlines and less witty clever flows.",0
"The Clipse stays with their slightly above average performance, but the guests get a tad bit on the annoying side.",0
"It was smart to put this track on this album, since it'll definetely help sell the album.",0
"Noreaga and Pharrell drop by to make an absolutely terrible clubbish song"" Put Em Up"".",0
This could be the worst song on this entire album.,0
"The clubbish beat, overproduced bullsh*t, triple-cadence flow and female vocals make this as commercial as it can possibly get.",0
"I dont know who started that crap about Noreaga being a dope lyricist, cause he is FAR from it.",1
Noreaga is TERRIBLE.,0
"Personally, i would rather nail my testicles to a board with a nail than listen to this.",0
"At last, after the many years of being away, Old Dirty Bastard a.k.a.",0
Dirt McGirt is BACK.,0
"The Neptunes provide the beat for the excellent"" Pop Sh*t"".",0
"The Neptunes beat is a very fitting, over-the-top sounding arrangement with a crazy guitar rift and drum loop.",0
"The sound effects in the background are fitting for Dirt, as he makes his triumphant return.",0
"His lyrics are, as expected, insane!",0
"ODB is truly back, as he spits exactly the same as he did when we left off, with over-the-top lyrics, his memorable angry delivery, and a dope flow.",0
ODB is excellent on the track as i truly feel that his lyrics have maybe even improved a tiny bit since his last outing.,0
"Engaged to be Married couple Nas and Kelis ( I think they're engaged ) finish off the album with the terrible"" Popular Thug"", which is a huge dissapointment for a Nas fan like myself.",0
This track sounds as if it was seemingly pulled right out of Nastradamus.,0
"Nas tries be a player / thug / gangsta once again, with uninspired lyrics and terrible subject matter, which is saddening.",0
"It sort of bothers me that Nas refuses to stick to one persona, and seems to sound like he is selling out once again.",0
"Kelis' vocals are admittedly nice, but boring at the same time.",0
"The song has a unique feel when it comes to production, as the Neptunes give us a semi-clubbish RandB beat, with guitars, synthesizers, and organ piano.",0
"However Nas ( incredibly enough ), has made this track unlistenable, with his terrible lyrics.",0
The only thing Clones has going for itself is the beats.,0
"The Neptunes, though commercial, are very good producers and skilled at making unique beats with extraordinary sounds.",0
"Unfortunately for them, their choice of emcees is somewhat limited, as they seemingly choose and sign some of the worst lyricists in the game.",0
"The sad thing is, even when they bring Nas along, who is one of the greatest of all time, even he f*cks it up with his sell-out mentality.",0
I would've preferred that this album be more of an instrumental piece than a showcase of artists.,0
"With only 2 good songs, there really isn't much hope for this album to be good, but im positive it will sell tons of records.",1
"Big D suggests you skip this one and pick up the new Cunninlynguists, Gangstarr, Canibus, or Little Brother albums.",0
"Those will definetely provide enjoyment, a LOT more than this.",0
1 Star,0
The Neptunes made the album I always wished P. Diddy would've made.,0
"Rather than being the focal point of the album, they're making the beats ( most of them ), producing the music, and simply adding their touches to the album.",0
"I always thought rather than rapping all over an album, Diddy would be better served simply executively producing an album of all star MC's.",0
"He seems to think that he makes all the hits, why not make an album full of them?",1
"But, he'd rather rap about J. Lo.",0
Puffy the business man?,0
The man.,0
Puffy the rapper?,0
Wack.,0
"This album has nothing to do with Diddy, but the Neptunes, Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo have made a smart move here.",0
"Since they make music for everyone anyway, rather than putting those songs on other people's albums, put them all on one album, on Star Trak ( their label ), and reap the benefits.",0
The two singles that were released received a ton of radio airplay.,0
Frontin' by Pharrell and featuring Jay-Z is everywhere.,0
"You turn on the radio, Pharrell shrieks.",0
"You watch MTV, Pharrell is crooning.",0
"Go to a music related website, they're talking about how the song is on top of the charts.",0
All this song does is give Pharrell the power to release a solo album.,0
I've talked to a few people and most of them like this song.,0
"I will listen to it if it's on, but in my opinion, he sounds like he's playing singer.",0
He sounds like an excellent karaoke singer.,0
The song does have it's quality production and Jay-Z lends his stamp to it as well.,0
The second single is Light Your Ass On Fire by Busta Rhymes.,0
"When I heard the title of the song, I didn't know that they were singing about literally lighting someone's rear end on fire.",1
"Actually, the song is more about Busta's fascination of watching a female shake her huge rear end.",0
It's no where near as clever as Sir Mix-a-lot's Baby Got Back.,1
"Pitiful song for someone like Rhymes who is an energetic force and lately had picked up his word play, but this is just bad.",0
"Of course, this CD is also an attempt to showcase some of their own talent.",0
The Clipse are featured on two songs.,0
Blaze of Glory is a decent track.,0
"It's one of those tracks I mentioned in the title that I'd love to have the instrumental rather than the actual song, but if you dig the Clipse, it's ok.",0
"Hot Damn which is nice, but again I'd love listening to the instrumentals.",0
"The beats are so intuitive and while it is all similar lending one to believe the Neptunes are stuck in their own formula, it still has charm.",0
"I'm not sure what to make of Roscoe P. Coldchain, other than the fact that I think his rap name is hilarious.",1
On Hot he sounds very monotone.,0
"Musically, the beat is very plain, giving Coldchain a chance to show off his skills.",0
But I didn't hear much out of his mouth that made me think he's going to be anything special.,0
The Neptunes did get some big stars as well.,0
"Other than Busta Bus and Jay-Z, they also got Nelly, Ludacris, N.O.R.E., Snoop, Old Dirty Bastard, and the duo of Nas and Kelis.",0
"For the most part, if you like Nelly and Luda, you'll like these songs.",0
They're simply what you'd expect.,0
Snoop comes strong with It Blows My Mind in what's simply another solid track from him after what I thought was a successful last album.,0
"Old Dirty is joined by Pharrell on Pop Sh*t, but with his new moniker, Dirt McGirt.",0
It's a fun track with Dirty's usual crazy antics.,0
"Not to say I completely understand what Dirt is rapping about since he sounds like a child learning to speak with new braces, but what would you expect from Dirt and the Neptunes?",1
"N.O.R.E., who scored several summers back with Superthug which was one of the songs which put the Neptunes on another level, stars on Put'Em Up.",0
"N.O.R.E. has always been mildly entertaining but I lost respect for him when he freestyled on"" The Wake Up Show"" and simply couldn't finish his verse.",1
They kept restarting him and he couldn't ride the beat at all.,1
"This track is nothing special, save for a catchy chorus, but that's about it.",0
"The most interesting track for me on the entire album is the last track, Popular Thug with Nas and his bride to be, Kelis.",0
Nas doesn't bag in his performance and brings his A game to balance Kelis' awesome vocals.,0
The Neptunes do supply one track for themselves in their N.E.R.D. alter ego.,0
It an interesting track called Losers that should've been the theme song for Revenge of the Nerds.,0
"The chorus goes,"" We will not be the losers, we will not leave until the job is done.""",1
"Very odd track with not only the lyrical content, but also just the style.",1
It's not what you'd expect.,1
"It was a good idea, with decent execution, but in the end, it's simply not my cup of tea.",1
"The production is flawless at times, but the way the Neptunes make beats sort of limits what MC's can do.",0
That's why much of what they do sounds so similar.,0
"The CD did come with a DVD which included videos for Frontin', Hot Damn, and Rock N' Roll by Fam-Lay.",0
Great Music to Play While: Experimenting with your keyboard,0
After 20 million plus records sold St. Lunatic Nelly has started his own record label called Derrty Entertainment.,0
"The first artist to drop an album from Derrty is none other than fellow St. Lunatic Murphy Lee, with his debut album Murphy's Law.",1
"The"" School Boy"" along with the other St. Lunatics dropped the groups debut Free City back in 2001.",0
After that album dropped Nelly fans started to really notice Murphy Lee( Which aint sayin much ).,0
After that many commercial artist also noticed Murphy Lee.,0
"He featured on The"" Roc Da Mic"" remix which also featured Nelly, Freeway and Beanie Sigel, and he he featured on the"" Welcome to Atlanta"" remix wich, Snoop, P. Diddy and Jermaine Dupri.",0
Murphy Lee is the second St. Lunatic other than Nelly to release a solo album.,0
Ali was the first and he record bombed worst than Baghdad.,0
After Ali's dismal sales Murphy Lee is setting out to prove that he can sell.,0
The first real single for this album is Wat Da Hook Gon Be.,0
Even though Shake Ya Tailfeather is getting ridiculous radio and video play that was actually a single from that Bad Boys Soundtrack.,0
Murphy's Law is all about having fun.,0
1. Be Myself( Intro ) - N/A - Just a sample of a woman singing I Just wanna be myself.,0
2. Don't Blow It(feat.,0
City Spud ) - $ /$ - Opens up with a City Spud phone message.,0
Murphy Lee gives a poor intro and then you can barely hear City Spud chorus over Murphy Lee yelling.,0
The beat is instantly a commercial sh!tter.,0
Murphy Lee takes the first verse and spits some really weak punchlines with a sad attempt at humor.,0
He continues using weak metafores and punchlines.,0
In his last verse it is still pretty weak but some of his lyrics are a bit better at first then he just falls off a cliff.,0
3. Hold Up(feat.,0
Nelly ) - $ /$ - This beat is of the commercial club type.,0
Murphy starts off and spits some real garbage.,0
"Nelly is on the chorus and it is f!ckin terrible"" I dont wanna leave by myself, Boy you aint gotta leave by yourself, Sh!t...TAXI"".",0
Murphy Lee raps about him and how women can't get enough of him.,1
""" I hit em up like Blu Cantrell, He-He-He-He-He-He-He-Hell"" Murphy take the mic again for another agonizing verse full of pimpin' and bullsh!t.",0
4. Grandpa Game Tight - 0 - This sh!t is just embarassing.,0
This clown refers to himself as Grandpa Game Tight. He talks about girls and his pimpin.,0
He is singing on the chorus about his Grandpa Game Tight game.,0
"His lyrics on the second verse aren't too bad but the subject matter is awful, and once the chorus comes around again you will be slamming your head against the wall.",1
In his wack a$ $ last verse he talks about his different women and pimping tendencies.,0
The chorus comes around for the last time and you will have an urge to break something after that garbage.,0
Trust me its terrible.,0
The beat on the other hand kind of saves this stink.,0
It is commercial but it doesn't sound bad and the violins add nice touch.,0
Still an egregious trac.,0
5. Luv Me Baby(feat.,0
Jazze Pha and Sleepy Brown ) - $ $ $ - Murphy talks about his dream woman on this track.,0
He raps about what he wants from that special lady on this track.,0
Jazze Pha takes care of the chorus and Sleepy does his thing at the end of the song.,0
This song is commercial as hell but it isn't all that bad and much better than that bullsh!t,0
Grandpa Sh!t Raps.,0
6. Murphy's Law( feat.,0
Darius Bradford and St. Louis Slim ) - N/A - Darius Bradford and St. Louis Slim making a speech.,0
7. Cool Wit It(feat.,0
"St. Lunatics ) - $ $ - The beat on this track is pretty tight, its laid back and on the chorus a sax jumps in along with some humming from a woman.",0
"However when these guys rap they end every bar with"" Cool Wit It"".",0
Now anyone who has consistantly read my review knows that I hate that unoriginal wack sh!t.,0
No need to say much more the only thing of value is the chorus.,1
8. This Goes Out(feat.,0
"Nelly, Roscoe, Cardin, Lil Jon and Lil Wayne ) - $ $ $ $ - This beat features some hitting bass and synthesized effects along with Nelly in the background yellin"" Ooooo"".",0
"Lil Jon as usual is yellin"" Yeah"" when the track opens.",0
Murphy Lee spits some above average pucnhlines in his verse.,0
Nelly has a sing along chorus.,0
Young Roscoe grips the track and spits fire.,0
Sure his verse is a bit commercial but he rips this sh!t crazy.,0
Cardin spits some commercial a$ $ rhymes about his pimpin and ruins it.,0
"Lil Jon comes on yelling"" Okaaaaayyyyy"".",0
"Everyone know Lil Jon doesn't really rhymes but all he does is yell with doubles of him yelling in the background which tends to just make noise, but here it isn't bad because his verse is only about 20 seconds long.",1
Lil Weezy f!cking rips this up ugly.,0
He continues the fire that was recently heard on his sqad mixtapes and I am really hyped for his next joint.,0
Of course what song with Lil Jon doesn't end with him yelling at the end of a song.,1
9. What Da Hook Gon Be(feat.,0
Jermaine Dupri ) - $ $ - Jermaine Dupri ask what the hook gonna be and Murphy Lee answers he doesn't need a hook...But that IS the hook.,1
Well Murphy spits more commercial lyrics than a TV.,0
JD on the chorus is sh!t because he is sh!t and everything he does is sh!t and he along with Baby The Birdman are on my hip-hop sh!tlist.,0
Not the worst song on this album but it damn sure is below average.,1
So X-Treme(feat.,0
King Jacob and Prentice Church ) - 0 - This song has a very laid back beat.,0
All three of these guys rap pimp type of lyrics.,0
The beat is so laid back that after a few seconds all you will hear is Z's.,0
Yes this muthaf!cka is boring.,0
Elementary Rhymes and bored beat equal terrible song.,0
11. How Many Kids You Got(feat.,0
Darious Bradford and St. Louis Slim ) - N/A - These two ask each other how many kids and baby momma's they have.,0
Sh!tty skit.,0
12. I Better Go(feat.,0
Avery Storm ) - $ $ $ 1/2 - In this song Murphy Lee speaks of a past love and how it went wrong.,0
"Murphy Lee comes correct with his lyrics but it wouldn't sound so bad if he didn't do that Nelly sing rapping and herre, thurr sh!t.",1
Murphy Lee talks about how he caught her cheating on him.,0
He tells how the more time they spent together the more they just made each other sick.,0
Avery Storm does a phenomenal job on the chorus.,0
The beat is great for this type of song.,0
13. Red Hot Riplets(feat.,0
"St. Lunatics ) - $ $ $ - Right off the top we get a madly commercial beat and Mr. Commercial himself Nelly opening up the track, rapping about how no one can mess with him and how he is just making sure his offspring are gonna be rich.",1
Ali and Nellys chorus is plain sh!t.,0
Kyjuan takes the second verse and it isn't bad at first then he starts talkin some wack sh!t about how his girl is All That and a Bag of Chips( Circa 1991 ).,1
Murphy Lee once again spits some above average lyrics but his sh!tty sing rapping ruins it terribly.,0
Ali comes up last and for some reason I am feeling his verse.,0
He spits some commercial a$ $ elementary rhymes but for some reason i am feeling it.,0
Maybe its his flow i don't know.,1
14. Regular Guy(feat.,0
Seven ) - $ $ $ $ 1/4 - Murphy Lee starts off with rap singing and one thing that is heard off the start is his herre bullsh!t.,0
The beat is for the clubs and is sickly commercial.,0
Seven's chorus also is clubby and commercial as hell.,0
However that is where the wack sh!t on this track ends.,0
Murphy Lee does some minor sing rap but for the most part he spits flames.,0
He gives some braggadocio and tell of how people cant mess with the Lunatics and also how he isn't going to change for anyone.,1
He tells of how he had a number one song while still in high school.,0
This is the best song on this album.,0
""" Im with five individuals /",0
They say we not original/,0
We all started underground like digital/,0
Now the haters lookin' pitiful/,0
We humble and hospitable/,0
"But lyrical we still sh-sh!t on you /""",0
15. God Don't Chill(feat.,0
King Jacob and Prentice Church ) - 0 - These two clown Prentice Church and King Jacob are garbage as f!ck.,0
The first song was only one song so I couldn't come to that conclusion.,0
After this however I wonder why the hell Murphy Lee put these clowns on an already slacking album.,0
This dumb a$ $ song is once again about pimpin and partying.,0
Murphy Lee spits the garbage also.,0
The production on this track is lazy.,0
The chorus is album stupid sing raps from Murphy Lee.,0
16. Murphy Lee(feat.,0
Zee ) - $ $ - Commercial a$ $ beat.,0
This track sees Murphy Lee kicking game to a girl at a party.,0
Zee does a great job on the chorus for this type of song.,0
"Murphy Lee's lyrics are pretty average here and he does the err, urr crap again and he also rap sings as usual.",0
17. Head From A Midget(feat.,0
Darius Bradford and St. Louis Slim ) - N/A - These Brothas aint funny.,0
Period!,0
18. Shake Ya Tailfeather(feat.,0
Nelly and P. Diddy ) - $ 1/2 - Since this song is so sh!tty,0
I wont write a new review for it i'll just use the one I used for Bad Boys II Soundtrack.,0
We got P. Diddy and Nelly on the same track wit Murphy Lee.,0
"Then again this song gets ya bouncin in the club no doubt so I guess you gotta respect it for what it is, and it is a pretty good party track.",1
"Lyrically Nelly spits his herre, thurr, abuse of the english language.",0
"The best rapper in St. Lunatics, Murphy Lee spits some mediocre sh!t but damn that"" I'm not hard, I got women to handle that/They be like, he the man when I'm really a Thunder Cat"" was f!ckin terrible.",1
"This cat also said"" I'm Young Like Turk, I like that Cash and that Money"" Then at the end his"" Im starvin like Marvin Gurrl( girl )/ I got 16 bars of ferre(fire )"" was...whooo.",0
"As I said before this is a club hit, but as a song in general it just suck!...",0
19. Same ol' Dirty(feat.,0
Toya ) - $ $ $ 1/2 - The beat on this song is pretty good and gives you a beat you would find in a 70's blaxploitation movie and it serves its purpose in this retrospective track.,0
We have Murphy Lee rappin about back in the day when he was a young buck.,0
Well at least in his first and third verses.,0
In the second verse he ruins it spitting terrible commercial a$ $ lyrics.,0
Toya does a superb job on the chorus however helping to uplift this track.,0
In the third verse Murphy Lee talks about the struggles he and the St. Lunatics had to deal with before Nelly blew up.,0
Like I said earlier Murphy Lee's rapping is just like Nelly.,0
He is all about having fun.,0
"He could care less about introspective rapping, or gangsta rapping, he wants to talks about partying, and pimpin hoes, with a few love stories thrown in.",0
"You will not find once on this track where Murphy Lee raps about killing, shooting, stabbing, or beatting the living hell out of someone.",1
"If you wanna hear that go buy DMX, he has plenty of it.",0
For the most part Murphy Lee's guest appearances are really weak except on This Goes Out.,0
"Also some of the singles he got for the chorus's such as Toya, Zee and Avery Storm do great jobs.",0
When Nelly and the St. Lunatics show up on a track for the most part its pretty wack.,0
King Jacob and Prentice Church are some of the sh!ttiest rappers i've ever heard and hope I never have to hear them again.,1
The stupid Darius Bradford and St. Louis Slim interludes aren't funny at all and are just a waste of wax.,0
I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone but if you are a Nelly or St. Lunatics fan you will like this.,0
Why?,0
Because you f!cking like Nelly.,0
"Then again I wont front when I was a couple years younger I was a Nelly fan, just check my Country Grammar review.",0
"Lets just face the facts at hand  even if Obie Trice was a garbage rapper ( and he is )  hes packed by the Superman of Hip-Hop, the seemingly invincible Eminem - able to make death threats in 16 bars, and pistol whip fools for jealousy, everything that Eminem touches really does turn gold.",0
Taking executive producer credits on his protgs debut album Cheers   Obie Trice has been literally blessed with success before he even said one whack word.,0
From the promise that in several copies of his album are golden tickets to meet the blonde one ( why not meet Obie?,1
"Oh yeah  no one cares ), to the cornball lead single  the sky is the limit.",1
"The aforementioned lead single entitled Got Some Teeth  is classic Eminem material  from its attempt at humor ( it fails ), to its elementary lyrics: and this is my favorite song / to sing along / when the deejay throws it on/ and if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep/and wake up / hopefully she got some teeth.",0
Right.,0
"Raise the roof yo  or, lets not and pretend we did.",1
"Average Man finds Obie busting more caps than the folks that dont like 50 Cent, which brings me to another important point: Hip-Hop is seeing the resurgence of thug mentality and while there are plenty of artists on higher planes, the mainstream is so convoluted with thuggery and ignorance that it s enough to break my b-boy loving heart.",1
"The bad boy persona continues with Cheers, a mediocre track that can only be described as well  mediocre.",0
"Dont Come Down  has an ill sample, but then Obie had to go and mess it up by rapping.",0
The parallels to Slim Shady continue with Obies apparent disdain for the woman who gave him life and sadness for the hardships he experience growing up as a young ghetto youth  which apparently is the only requirement for getting a record deal these days.,0
While Eminem does get the executive producer credit  his beats are just the swap meet equivalent of Dr. Dres harder and edgier material and so all of the tracks produced by Em sound budget.,0
"Perpetual hook singer Nate Dogg stops by to bore me with his voice on The Set Up, where Obie rambles on about a shady woman (yawn ).",0
"Dr. Dre also gets his flow on on Sh!t Hits The Fan - and while I like the sound of Dres voice, his flow is just not getting it so his best bet is to stay behind the boards, Obies on this track too  but he sucks.",1
We All Die One Day  finds two thugs ( 50 and Obie ) uniting for what sounds like a cheap mix tape track.,0
"The gun talk, dont f( $ 8k with me talk keeps on going like the energizer bunny and it was nt original on track 1 and at 9  it s wearing thin on my nerves.",1
D-12 fans ( all one of you ) can be happy since Kon Artis guests on Spread Yo Sh!t whose only savior is that the beat is a head nodder.,0
The one good track ( and I use the word good loosely ) on Cheers  would be Hands On You  and maybe it s only because Obie sounds like 50 Cents Hip-Hop stepchild.,0
"Featuring Eminem  the song has a strong hook, average beat on this thugged-out love song of sorts.",0
"I might be alone in my beliefs  but I feel like lately Busta Rhymes has been good lately on everyones material but his own  case in point would be Oh!, despite the fact that the music sounds like the score from Gremlins   Obie and Busta sound pretty damn good on the track and it would get my pick for one of the better tracks.",0
- Final Thoughts -,0
"While I respect everyones right to try to help their friends out once they get famous, everybody cant be a star and Obie Trice is just not a star.",1
"His rhymes are average at best, his flow is monotonous and the fact that he seemingly cant stand independent of Marshall Mathers, does nt help his cause either.",1
"So if youre thinking about getting a shiny gold ticket, dont even waste your time  its back to the drawing boards for Obie: real name, too many gimmicks.",1
Great Music to Play While: counting the minutes to the album ends.,0
David Banner has been around for a minute but has yet to score a big hit.,0
That is until now.,0
With his collaboration with Lil Flip burning up the radio I figured I'd give this a listen.,0
So since my brother had already picked this up I borrowed it from him.,0
This is Banner's second album after he scored a southern hit with Them Firewater Boyz.,0
This second album has already sold a ton of copies and with constant rotation of the single Like a Pimp currently heating up dance floors across the south it's bound to sell even more.,0
But does this mean the album is a hit.,0
I don't think so but then again I'm only one person.,1
Banner is from the state of Mississippi in case you didn't know.,1
And even if the album title doesn't tip you off to his home state trust me he hollars it out enough on this album to drive you insane.,1
"Here is the tracklising for Mississippi,",0
1. Intro,0
2. What It Do ( featuring Smoke D),0
3. Might Getcha ( featuring Lil' Jon ),0
4. Like A Pimp ( featuring Lil Flip ),0

16. Bring It On ( featuring J Da Groover and Mississippi Shawty ),0
17. Still Pimpin' ( featuring Marcus.,0
and Kamikaze ),0
18. Outro,0
This cd has left me with mixed feelings.,0
On one hand there are the tracks which I know Banner put some thought into and then there's the tracks that just leave you wondering who would put out such trash.,0
"With tracks like Cadillac on 22s, Bush, and Mississippi you start to believe that there's something to this rapper from the poorest state in the Union.",0
"But then you get obvious club tracks like Really Don't Wanna Go, Like a Pimp, and Might Getcha and you start to see why Southern rap has such a bad reputation.",0
"In case you've never heard David Banner before his flow can best be described as a sort of raspy, ruff sound.",1
"His production on the other hand is loud, but at the same time very intricate.",0
Banner incorporates live instruments on my personal favorite track Cadillac on 22s.,0
When looking at the tracklisting for this album I singled this song out as possibly the worst track on the album.,0
But once I heard the laid back beat and the acoustic guitar I realized I had this track all wrong.,0
"Here's a few bars from this introspective song,",0
"Lord I'm sick of jumping, Lord just please tell me something",0
"My folks still dumping my music, bumping but I feel nothing",0
My heart is stelly pumping,0
My heart is stelly breaking,0
"Sometimes I feel like I'm faking, man",0
I'm so sick of taking,0
Maybe hell ain't a place meant for us to burn,0
Maybe Earth is telling just a place for us to learn,0
"Bout yo love, yo will and grace",0
Sometimes I wish I wasn't born in the first place,1
"Maybe this first base, God knocked the ball up out the park",0
So we can come home this world right here is feeling so dark,0
"Feeling so cold, Lord I'm feeling so old",0
I dunno if I can take this world right here no more,1
22 inch rims on the' Lac,0
I guess that was yo footprint in the sand carrying us on yo back,0
"Banner also manages to touch on keeping kids off drugs, and out of the streets on this track.",0
While not the most intricate rhymes they are flawless when spit over this beat.,1
Bush is a track that gets at the president and the way Mississippi is treated.,0
Banner does not hide his displeasure for the president and his hypocritical ways over a bass beat with another acoustic guitar.,1
"Banner raps, I'm runnin' up in this sh*t like a track meet/You murdered, up in Texas where killin' is such a sin/",0
The first month you in office you started killin' again.,0
My feelings on Like a Pimp are mixed.,0
I enjoy the beat but the subject matter is horrible.,0
I also want to point out that I'm no fan of Lil Flip so the fact that I dislike this song should come as no surprise.,1
But my personal feelings have in no way hampered this song's rise on the charts.,1
This once again proves how stupid most people are.,0
The lyrics are boring attempts at humor and braggadocio and in no way add to the albums overall value.,1
"Songs like F***'Em, and What it Do are detestable pieces of sediment.",0
Please avoid these songs at all costs.,0
The lyrics are just a mixed bag of profanities spit over average beats.,0
DJ KLC of Beats by the Pound fame handles the production on F***'Em with all the skill he exuded while working for No Limit.,0
Which in case you didn't know that was not a compliment.,1
Overall I would have to say that if you don't really love southern rap you should probably stay away from this one.,1
Granted a couple of the tracks are worth downloading but I wouldn't rush out to do that either.,1
"He gained about 3 inches, got a Jheri curl, got some tattoo's and dropped the Lil off of his name.",0
He's a big boy now and his voice is starting to crack.,0
""" Hip-Hop's Top-Tot"" as RollingStone proclaims is now back to release his third album.",0
Now that he is all grown up he is writing his own rhymes.,0
"Maybe this is a positive considering JD was writing his previous stuff, but than again it could be worst.",0
"Lil Bow Wow's first albums were purely commercial, with catchy hooks and forgettable elementary lyrics.",0
But he was a junior high kid so that is forgivable.,0
"Now however is high school time and he needs to step it up, or become an afterthought.",0
"Sure everyone loves a little kid rappin because it is just"" so cute"".",0
Well with no furthur adue lets check out Unleashed,1
1. Get it Poppin' - $ /$ - We get some dog barking and then Swizz comes on the track making noise in the background and on the chorus.,0
"Lil Bow Wow should change his name to Pretty Boy Wow, and team up the P.B.T. aka Pretty Boy Thug...Then again P.B.T. would lyrically outshine him on every track.",0
"Man, Lil Bow Wow talks about the girl and booty and how aint no brother is as fly as he is.",1
"The beat that Swizz Beat drop isn't bad, but its ruined by Lil Bow Wow.",0
2. Let's Get Down(feat.,0
Baby ) - 0 - Terrible song...,0
I wont dare to explain.,0
"Turn on MTV, BET or the radio if you wanna hear this mess.",0
Baby should be expelled from the rap game.,0
"He suffers from the disease of wackneitis, which is apparently contageous, and he's touched Bow Wow.",0
"Even worst the chick on the chorus doesn't even sound sexy, which what she's trying to do... What a mess...Check out more on this song here",0
""" I know a girl named Kiesha/",0
She's no groupie/,0
"but far from a star, 22's made her choose me/",0
Like Ooh Wee/,0
"Tellin all her friends in the Benz, he don't really look 16 do heeee/""",0
"Tragic... I feel sorry for the beat, even though it's terrible.",0
"3. Eighteen - $ $ - He is talking to all the""young n's"" out here...Anyway he raps about when he talks eighteen.",0
"He wants a girl friend, some cars and everything...He then says"" It's Weezy-Baby""...Im thinkin my n!gga Lil Wayne gonna jump up and rip the track, nope Bow Wow calls himself that.",0
"Last year when I turned Eighteen i had these wishes too, but I know I could write a better song than this.",0
"He then gives us some terrible news stating he's"" Unfadable"", so we will be bombarded with garbage from him for a long time.",0
4. Follow Me - 0 - Another commercial beat.,0
"After listening to this track I don't respect Bow Wow as an artist anymore, therefore he is still LIL Bow Wow to me.",1
Back to the track.,0
"He gives advice to all the youngsters out there if they wanna be like him they must have they pants hangin off the @ss, they must have the sticker show on there New Era fitted cap.",0
You must be cocky.,0
"Its a must you rock two chains, clothes over sized and of course you gotta have the sickenin rims... I will add on another one for the youngster wanting to be like Lil Bow Wow...You absolutely MUST write wack rhymes.",0
"Anything more is unacceptable, seriously!",0
5. My Baby(feat.,0
Jagged Edge ) - $ $ $ - This beat is pretty tight for the type of song this is and Lil Bow Wow jumps on the track with lyrical feces.,0
"Well it really isn't that bad, but it seems like Lil Bow Wow is kind of trying to be like Jay-Z here.",1
From the uh-huh-uh-huh's that Jay-Z does to his overall flow.,0
This song is about Lil Bow Wow and a girl from the time he met her and lost her and wants her back.,0
Jagged Edge does a nice job on the chorus.,0
At the end of the song we get a freestyle from Lil Bow Wow.,0
"Then a voice states"" Thats what I'm talkin bout, thats old school"", which is just blatant disrespect to any old school rapper.",0
"The Don, The Dutch - $ $ 1/2 - The Neptunes drop this club banger.",0
This beat is tight for the clubs.,0
Lil Bow Wow spits some aight lyrics on this track.,0
"He spits braggadocio on the first verse, then he goes on to spit some cocky rhymes of him and women.",0
He talks of a chick at one of his shows.,0
"The chorus is track, but the chick singing does a nice job.",0
7. The Movement - $ $ $ $ $ - Hold Up!!! Do I hear a hint of introspection from Lil Bow Wow...Check that I respect him now.,0
Bow Wow raps about being a young black child in the ghetto.,0
"He talks about how the ghetto has a terrible rap, but stuff happens due to cultural bias.",0
He talks about how the world is placed on his/our generation.,0
He tells about the wars.,0
He says that the generation is in the crossfire.,0
"He tells that we never get answers when he ask question, but they only tell us to pull our pants up.",1
The chorus is tight and sums up the situation of a teenager in the hood.,0
"I know this song isn't really a five star song...More like a 4 star song, but on this album it sticks out like a sore thumb...In a positive way.",1
""" I'll probably be banned/But I gotta take a stand/",0
Cause you see what happen when Eminem make ya stand/,0
"He just buff, be cautious /",0
See we all targets /,0
My thoughts are sporadic/,0
I feel so asthmatic/,0
"Outta breath, Sic it UP(? ) /",0
"So we taking action against the democracy, full of hypocracy /",0
I know its more to me than my hip-hop eyes can see/,0
"That's what the homies said to me""",0
"8. I Can't Lose - $ $ $ - This beat is commercial as hell, but its still pretty tight.",0
Bow Wow spits some braggadocio stating that all the garbage in the rap game is gonna end.,0
"He does throw in his raps about girls loving him, but form the most part it isn't commercial bullsh!t.",1
"He shouts out Jay-Z, Ja, Nelly, Nas, Eminem and Jadakiss, but he says he is holding it down for the kids.",0
"He throws out a challege to all the young rappers stating"" No Rapper in my age bracket, is makin it happen, the way that I made it happen"".",1
This whole song is pretty much a battle rhymes towards the younger rappers...Such at the horrendous Lil J.,0
9. Hey Lil Mamma(feat.,0
"Jagged Edge ) - $ /$ - See My Baby...But a bit worst, he raps to a girl, sayin he wants to come over a watch a movie...sure.",0
I Got Y'all - 0 - This song features Bow Wow rappin to the females again.,0
This is another Let's Get Down.,0
Another wack track full of Bow Wow claiming he is the best cat in the world and telling the girls that no other boys are close to his status...,1
"Not only is this track wack, but it also loses the respect I had for him.",1
Back to Lil Bow Wow.,0
11. I'll Move On(feat.,0
Mario ) - $ $ 1/2 - The song features the Teen RandB sensation and Chris Rock look-alike Mario.,0
This beat sounds strikingly similar to Bounce Wit Me.,0
"Lil Bow Wow spits some pretty introspective lyrics in his first verse about opinions on him and his life, but he is just trying to grow up.",0
"After that however, Lil Bow Wow goes back to the commercial garbage that we are accustomed to.",0
Mario does a superb job on the chorus,0
12. To My Mama(feat.,0
Amerie ) - $ $ $ 1/2 - Lil Bow Wow drops a nice heartfelt song about his mom.,0
"He talks about his life before he got big, and now how he is helping take care of her now.",0
"That My Mama, My Roaddogg stuff is crazy annoying however.",0
"Amerie, really shines on this track and helps it out a load.",0
13. Im Back( Hidden Bonus Track ) - $ $ - This song has a west coast type of sound to it.,0
Not quite G-Funk but tight nonetheless.,1
Lil Bow Wow raps some purely commercial lyrics here.,0
He raps about his fans and the sitcoms he appears on.,0
He raps to the girl and he talks about his ride.,0
""" Had to retire my Mickey Mouse, had gotten to old /",0
"Peach Fuzz on my lip, homeboy, I'm grown""",0
"Come on duke, just look at the album cover...You still look like a lil boy, put that Mickey Mouse chain back on!",0
"Ok Now I know this album is for the little girlies so Bow Wow can come over and get som pus...umm, watch some movies.",0
The Movement is the best song on this album by far and it is the only reason to have this.,0
"So instead of buying this, go and download The Movement.",0
"If in some odd way Bow Wow can comtinues to rap like he does on The Movement, he may be able to put out a tight album.",0
"I mean rapping about the young girls is gonna get old unless he wants to take the approach of R.Ke...Nope I wont say that, because I like Kels.",0
"I only recommend this to 16 year old girls who want to heard Bow Wow rap over and over again, because they think they have a chance at landing a date with him.",0
"Otherwise, steer clear of this garbage, please.",0
"Since Lil Bow Wow can rhyme, let me give it a shot.",0
"Leash him back up, and put the muzzle on his mouth/",0
Because this young boy belongs in the dog house,0
How was that y'all?,0

Lil J- Back to J,0
I am not a fan of rap.,1
"I'm slowly coming around to it, but it takes a lot to impress me, in any genre of music for that matter.",0
"Needless to say, I won't be shouting praises for Bow Wow's"" Unleashed"" anytime soon.",1
The first track is suprisingly good.,0
"It has a nice beat, and the lyrics are of the rap-star breed.",0
"Totally danceable, and imagineable as music at a teenaged club.",0
"The second track, Bow's first single off this album, is listenable, but nothing outstanding.",0
"The sixteen-year-old Bow Wow's music video to this song is of him taking his driver's test, which just goes to show the audience Bow is rapping to.",0
Adults need not apply.,1
""" Eighteen,"" the third track is one of the most annoying songs I've heard a rapper sing in a long time.",0
"The underbeat is headache-inducing, and even though I've yet to turn eighteen, I can't relate to any of his lyrics, which leave a lot to be desired.",1
Most of the tracks on this CD are what one would expect.,0
"It sounds slightly more mature than"" Lil"" Bow Wow's album ( Bow has dropped the Lil in an attempt to seem more mature ) but it still plays to the same, younger fan base.",0
I understand why pre-teen girls and guys like Bow Wow.,0
"For them, he's a rapper close to their age, singing about things that they find cool.",0
"Bow's last track"" To My Mama"" was meant to be a rap dedicated to ( obviously ) his mother.",0
"It loses it's meaning, at least to me, because Bow enjoys rapping,"" My Mama/My road dogg"" several times.",0
But maybe that's the new compliment in rap star language.,0
"I guess I'm just not hip, yo.",0
"Tracks: 12, plus a bonus track",0
"Buy For: A younger girl or boy, around ten-fourteen that likes rap.",0
Play During: Your daughter's 13th birthday party.,0
"Price: Around thirteen dollars, depending where you buy it.",0
When I first heard about Loud Rocks I was completely jacked.,0
The idea of a CD with rappers teaming up with rock bands to do re-makes of hip hop classics just seemed like such a great idea.,0
When Loud Rocks came out I went out and got it.,0
The concept of this CD is great is was just poorly executed by Loud records.,0
This CD has a great line-up.,0
"With tracks by Xzibit and Sevendust, Sugar Ray and the Alkaholics ( now the Liks ), Incubus and the late Big Punisher, Ozzy and the Wu Tang Clan, System of a Down and Wu Tang, and many more.",0
"The line-up is stacked, but this CD is not.",1
"The main problem that faces almost every pairing of rap artists and rock bands is that there is no chemistry between the two, and the songs seem forced.",1
Some songs dont even sound like the two parts were even recorded together.,1
"On a few songs I doubt the rapper was even involved, it just sounds like they edited him in from past recordings.",0
I know for a fact that Old Dirty B*stard was in jail when they made this album so they obviously just edited his part from shame into the System of a Down version.,0
All the songs sound worse than the originals.,0
"The rock parts are also sloopily throw together, and dont sound like time was put into them.",1
It just sounds like the bands adapted guitar riffs to the beat of the original hip hop beat.,0
"This whole albums is flawed, I think it was just a gimmick.",0
Im sure it lined the pockets of some Loud executive.,0
They cashed in on the rap-rock trend.,0
They sure suckered my nieve self in and got my cash.,0
"This CD is nt horrid, there are a couple tracks that stand-out.",0
The Shootyz Groove song Caribbean Connection  is pretty good.,0
Its mainly because Shootyz Groove is a hip hop group with some rock influences.,0
If one good thing came out of this album is was that I was introduced to Shootyz Groove.,0
The have a real band backing their lyricists.,0
Kind of like a Latin version of the Roots.,0
"The System of a Down cover of Wu Tangs Shame also does nt blow, mainly because the lead singer of System of a Down can rap.",1
"On the other hand, there is a ton of pure sh*te on this album.",0
Crazytown is so bad it hurts my ears.,0
The Incubus cover of Still Not a Playa is pure bubble-gum pop.,0
They sound like a bad cover band that should be playing childrens birthday parties.,0
A lot of these covers ruin the originals.,0
"I have no clue why Everlast needed to re-make the Mobb Deep classic Shook Ones, he just made it sound band.",1
The MOP song How About Some Hardcore  was butchered by Butch Vig.,0
"Im not sure who Butch Vig is, but their blend of rock and techno ruined How About Some Hardcore.",1
All of the songs on this album sound forced and will never get that rap-rock chemistry that songs like Bring the Noise by PE and Anthrax or even Walk this Way  by Run DMC and Aerosmith had.,1
None of these songs will ever be performed live by the two groups that laid them down for this album because it s all studio magic.,1
Dont waste your money on this album.,1
If you want good rap-rock check out Confrontation Camp.,0
Loud Rocks is a train wreck that you should avoid at all costs.,0
What a very surprising let down.,0
"I am a fan of DJ Muggs, and the rest of the artists on this album, but for the amount of starpower compiled onto one CD one would expect better.",0
The very poor beat mixing and sloppy freestyling has me at a loss.,0
"With an exeption of one or maybe two songs, this CD is not worth a second look.",1
"Maybe listen to your buddies copy, to check it out, if your curious",0
The year was 1996.,0
Dr. Dre had managed to disentangle himself from the talons of Suge Knight and Death Row Records.,0
"Dre had started his own label, Aftermath, and was ready to sit back, renounce his gangsta image and watch the money roll in.",0
"While Death Row was reeling from the death of 2Pac and the disappointing sales of Snoop's Doggfather album, Dre was poised to start a new rap empire.",0
"So out he came with this Aftermath sampler compilation, and we didn't hear from him again for three years.",1
The reason?,0
"The album more or less sucked, and Dre's midas production touch was missing on most of the four or five songs he actually had a hand in.",0
"It's a shame, too, because the one Dre track on the album,"" Been There, Done That,"" is really good.",0
"The production is smooth and silky, with distinctive percussion and a lazy bass line, and Dre sounds more confident and comfortable than ever as he brags about his earthly possessions.",0
"("" I've got a palace in the hills overlooking the sea / It's worth eight, but I only paid 5.3."" )",0
"An entire post-gangsta Dre album in this vein would have sold through the roof, but alas, he hadn't the creative energy for it.",0
The other album highlights can be summed up in a couple paragraphs.,0
"KRS-One, Nas and B-Real of Cypress Hill perform under the name Group Therapy with"" East Coast / West Coast Killas,"" a Dre-produced track that picks up where"" Natural Born Killas"" left off.",0
"The vocal trade-offs are seamless, the bass is solid and the whistling Dre synth is bad@ss as ever.",0
"Mel-Man, who co-produced Dr. Dre 2001, gets his solo track in"" Sh**tin' on the World,"" which overcomes its rather non-descript Dre beat with humor, intentional and otherwise.",0
"( Mel's liner notes read,"" I grew up with roaches y'am saying straight reppin' the projects to the fullest!"" )",0
"The aborted R+B girl group Hands-On turns in the piano-heavy, sultry groove"" Got Me Open"" with a Dre rap reminiscent of the same era's"" No Diggity.""",0
"And RC ( the only artist on the album with two songs ) turns in a decent, funky remake of David Bowie's"" Fame.""",0
"Otherwise, the album is indistinct, passed down to Dre production apprentices like Bud'da, Floyd Howard, Flossy P and Maurice Wilcher.",0
"There's a reason acts like Miscellaneous, King T, Nowl and Sharief never took off.",1
"As an intro record-label sampler, you have to wonder if Dre planned to produce or oversee albums from all these acts or if he was just looking to put together a half-@ssed compilation and laugh all the way to the bank while Death Row went under.",0
"Either way, it was a mistake.",0
DJ Kay Slay is the king of the mixtape scene.,0
He has won the Justo Mixtape Award for Best Mixtape DJ 4 year in a row.,0
"He has many classic mixtape series such as"" The Regulator"" and"" Renegades"".",0
"He is also the reason why DJ Clue boycotts the mixtape award because Clue b!tched about now winning the award last year and Kay Slay shut him up with an intimidating call out on one of his mixtapes( even though it seems to me he was really calling out DJ Envy, everyone wants to believe he is calling out Clue because Clue is a bigger name ).",0
This is Kay Slay's first commecial mixtape release.,0
"Even though He is considered"" The StreetSweeper"" The Streetsweeper DJ's consist of him, DJ Pruitt and others.",0
"Him talking over song in him husty voice can get annoying but his exclusive whether its a new song no other DJ has or an exclusive freestyle, makes up for it.",0
Well enough on Kay Slay Lets get into the review.,0
1. Intro ( DJ Kayslay ) - $ /$ - This opens with a dedication to Kayslay's father.,0
Kayslay actually raps with Aaron Hall singing in the background.,0
DJ Kayslay sounds terrible as a rapper as he sounds as Darth Vader mixed with Ja Rule.,0
Kayslay is a pretty bad rapper.,0
Also This beat is lazy making this a terrible intro.,0
"2. I Never Liked Ya @ss ( Scarface, Raekwon and Fat Joe ) - $ $ 1/2 - Face starts off this song spitting some pretty tight rhymes.",0
Raekwon really dissapoints me on this song.,0
I was expection some classic Raekwon flame and I got nothing but a crappy verse.,0
Fat Joe comes up after Raekwon and follows suit spitting stench.,0
The best thing about this song is that face spits first so after he is done you can go to the next track.,0
3. The Streetsweeper ( The Lox ) - $ $ $ - Styles P opens up spitting flames.,0
Basic SP styles talking about brutally killing people and junk but he alway does a good job of it to me.,0
The chorus to this song is wack.,0
Sheek is second and is just terrible.,0
He really doesn't make sence when he raps and his metafores are crap.,1
I think he tries to hard to fix funny with gangsta and it doesn't work at all.,1
Jadakiss comes up last with an average verse.,0
It isn't bad but it isn't nearly what you would expect from Kiss.,1
The beat here is pretty mediocre but it has that D Block feel to it.,0
4. 50 Shot Ya ( 50 Cent ) - $ $ 1/2 - This starts out with Kayslay talking some super hardcore crap.,0
""" I'll smack the f*ckin' sh!t out ya favorite DJ"".",0
I've never understood why Kayslay is so made all the time.,1
Now to the song...50 Shot Ya is OOLLDD!,0
I swear this song's been around since last summer.,0
It also isn't the best 50 track out.,1
In a matter of fact I think it's one of 50's worst.,0
This beat gets annoying to me.,0
Couldn't they have found a better 50 Song to put on here.,0
"Maybe"" Dem Not Ready"" by 50 and Sean Paul perhaps?",0
5. Get Shot the F!ck Up ( Mobb Deep and Prodigy ) - $ $ $ - This beat is pretty damn tight but let it be known I hate Mobb Deep.,0
Prodigy in particular.,0
He was at one time hot as hell.,0
Now he as a lazy laid back flow and I hate it.,0
So when he opens up I get what I expect.,0
I sloppy and bad 1st verse.,0
The chorus isn't bad though.,1
Big Noyd goes next and I like his verse.,0
Right now i'd say Noyd is better then P and Hav.,0
"Hav goes after Noyd and he spits some pretty sub-par sh!t...Well It's not that bad but it's hard for me to like anything the Mobb does nowadays, but Noyd's verse combined with this beat and some ok spittage from Havoc save it from P's trash.",1
"6. Everybody Wanna Shine ( Black Rob, G-Dep and Craig Mack ) - $ $ - So Will the real Kayslay please shut up!",0
I am getting tired of Kayslay's hardcore blabber already.,0
"Black Rob has a crap verse, and next G-Dep has a pretty bad one also.",0
Craig Mack comes up and really rips it though.,0
The chorus goes with Kayslay taking sh!t as usual.,0
I guess instead of talking crap over someone elses song they give him a chorus to run wild on.,0
"7. Too Much For Me ( Nas, Baby, Foxy Brown and Amerie ) - $ $ $ 1/2 - The first single for this album and if you see the video you will notice Nas isn't there.",1
Kayslay and Nas now have beef because Nas didn't show up for the video shoot.,1
It's a shame considering Nas has a sickening verse.,0
I mean Nas kills this thing something ridiculous.,0
Amerie's chorus is pretty average.,0
"Baby spits some of his better bars on this track, as Foxy spits crappage.",0
"This beat is nice andfits the song perfectly, and Nas's"" Oh Yeah's"" in the background are a nice touch.",0
8. Purple Haze ( Cam'Ron ) - $ $ $ - If it isn't the beat waster himself!,1
Along with the rest of the Diplomats I've never seen anyone in the history of the rap game just trash so many sickenin beats!,1
This song is another example.,0
This beat is hot as hell!,0
Camron comes on with his lazy @ss flow and stinks it.,0
However this beat is so hot I can still listen to this song.,0
Even the chorus is tight.,0
9. Freestyle ( Eminem ) - $ $ $ - Eminem starts explaining how bad of a mixtape DJ.,0
"This freestyle is over the"" Love Me"" beat off of 8 Mile.",0
This isn't a traditional Slim Shady crazy/funny freestyle.,1
Shady seem to be really p!ssed and he just talks about his involvment in the rap game from rappin to producing for people like Jay-Z and Freeway.,0
Not bad but not what I was expection.,1
"I was expecting another"" Peg Legged Greg"" type of freestyle.",0
"The Champions ( Doo Wop, Tony Touch, DJ Clue, Funk Master Flex, DJ S and S, Brucie B, Kid Capri and Ron G ) - $ $ - Doo Wop starts off and spits a pretty tight verse.",0
Tony Toca is next and his bar are straight wack!,0
DJ Kay Slay is next and he spits some angry garbage.,0
S and S I think goes next and spits an average verse.,0
I think Ron G is next and spits a doo doo verse.,0
Kid Capri then comes up and spits an above average verse.,0
"Brucie B is on the chorus, and Clue and Funk Flex are in the intro.",0
Apparently Clue and Kayslay have resolved their differences.,0
"11. 7 Deadly Sins ( Vita, Angie Martinez, Duchess, Lady May, Amil, Sonya Blade and Remi Martin ) - $ $ $ $ - The beat here is tight.",0
Listening to Vita and I beg to know why the hell Murder Inc. chose Charli Baltimore in favor of Vita?,0
Vita really rips this joint.,0
Amillion spits some sub-par lyrics here.,0
Angir Martinez lays it down for the haters and it comes off pretty tight.,0
Vita lets you know who it is on this track on the chorus.,0
"Lady May spits the best verse I've ever heard from her, not that I hear much of her.",1
Sonya Blade also spits the best i've ever heard of her.,0
Duchess just straight rips her part.,0
She spits flames here.,0
""" Open my mouth/and they respect my diction/You Open ya mouth/and cats wanna let they kids in"".",0
If Duchess spits the flame then Remi lets out the inferno.,0
Remi doesn't dissapoint as the best female rapper out there ( in my opinion ).,1
This is the second best song on the album.,0
"12. New Jack City ( Posta Boy, Shells, Grafh, Cassidy and Jae Hood ) - $ $ $ $ 1/2 - The future of the rap game at its finest.",0
Not to mention these 5 spit the best punch line out there.,1
Posta Boy opens up and shows when he was the first rapper from 106th and Park to be retired.,0
He opens up and spits and above-average verse here.,0
"Next up is Shells, andhe spits flame.",0
""" Yo you boys is silly/Im next says Pac and Biggie/and I'm bout Major Figgaz like Dutch and Gillie/Catch Shells all-star weekend down in Philly/on my hip pack heat like a bowl of chilly.""",0
Grafh steps up to the plate and he also spits heat.,0
"He follows the chorus of"" We Just Can't get along"" with"" cause a lot of y'all are fakin/1 minute later its a salama lenkum(? )/2 minutes later, its wheres my salami bacon /"".",0
The punchline king Cass is next and spits fire.,0
This isn't nearly the best of Cassidy but its still tight nontheless.,0
"The prince of D Block Jae Hood comes up to bat and knocks out a homer, like he had a corked bat.",0
This is the best track on this album.,0
"13. Westside Driveby (E-A-Ski, Mc Ren and Kam ) - $ $ 1/2 - I Like this G-Funk beat.",0
"Ski's verse is aight, not bad at all.",1
Mc Ren's on the other hand isn't a favorite of mine.,1
Kam just spits crap.,0
I like the chorus though.,0
14. Ima Smack this Muthaf!cka,0
( Nore ) - $ /$ - What the hell is this?,0
Dirty South Nore?!?,0
He musta spent some time in kentucky.,0
"The chorus here is trash, the lyrics here are trash and the beat here is trash.",0
That about sums it up.,0
15. Angel's Voice ( The Flipmode Squad ) - $ $ $ - Bad beat.,0
"Rampage spits some really violent lyrics here, even though that doesn't make it good.",1
Busta comes up and rips this song up.,0
This is classic Busta right here.,0
Rah Digga also spits a tight one here.,0
I got U ( Styles P and Bristal ) - $ $ - This is a Bristal song with an SP chorus.,0
Styles's chorus is the only reason this song gets and extra $.,0
Bristal spits two wack verses over a corny beat.,0
"17. Take a Look at My Life [remix ] ( Fat Joe, Remi Martin and A Bless ) - $ $ $ 1/2 - This beat is hot as hell.",0
"Fat Joe starts off spitting his own version of Special Ed's"" I Got it Made"".",0
After that he spits some tight bars then it goes into the chorus which isn't good but not bad either.,1
Reminese comes up next and rips it as usual.,0
This isn't her best...far from it but it's still good.,1
A Bless comes up and even though i've never heard of him he rips it.,1
DJ Kayslay comes up at the end ruining it screaming more i'll slap your favorite DJ trash.,0
"18. Coast to Coast gangstas ( Sauce Money, Joe Budden, WC, Bun B, Killer Mike and Hak Ditty ) - $ $ $ - Sauce Money starts off and spits a terrible verse.",0
Next up Killer Mike.,0
A pretty tight verse for Mike even though I am not a fan of his.,1
Bun B is next and he does a nice job on this track.,0
"Someone comes up just naming different types of guns, then WC comes up spittin fire.",0
Joe Budden also kills this track.,0
Hak Ditty comes up last and spoils the track with a bad rap.,0
19. Nino Brown ( Wyclef and Hollywood ) - 0.1$ - TRASH,0
Put that Thing Down (8Ball and MJG) - $ $ $ - This beat is aight.,0
8Ball rips this joint up.,0
MJG is a funny dude.,0
"He just talks stupid sh!t but it doesn't mess up the song, it fits perfectly.",0
A pretty nice track to end the album with.,0
I can honestly say there are only 3 tracks that I could listen to on the regular basis.,0
"They are"" 7 deadly Sins"""" New Jack City"" and"" Take a Look at my Life[remix ]"".",0
"Kayslay should have officially released"" Month of the Bad Guy pt.2"" instead of this trash.",0
"That has songs I can actually listen to, such as"" When You hear That"" by Beanie Sigel, ODB and Peedi Crakk,"" 7 Deadly Sins"","" Fire"" by Joe Budden and Busta Rhymes, a couple Lumidee remixes,"" Money Mayne"" by 50 Cent and Lil Flip,"" Get Familiar"" by 50 Cent and XL, and"" Party Ova Here"" by Rah Digga and Lloyd Banks.",0
"Instead of picking up this garbage, you might as well hit a street corner up and see if someone is pushin the newest Streetsweepers mixtape instead of picking up this crappy one.",0
Ok.. so lemme break it down for ya.,0
"Cash Money Millionaires came along many years ago, but weren't recognized until 1998 when they had a huge empire of hit-making south rappers with no talent, but catchy songs.",1
"The main acts in Cash Money were Juvenile, Lil Wayne, Turk, and B.G., known as the Hot Boys.",0
"However, in 2001, they all made the smartest moves in their careers, and walked out on Cash Money Records, excluding Lil Wayne, who remained.",0
"The others complained about not recieving their neccessary money from album sales, and walked out.",1
The Cash Money empire was all but destroyed as they released mediocre record in which even commercial fans were shunning.,0
The underground fans cheered as the downfall of one of hip hop's horrible empires was destroyed worse than Rome.,0
"These guys gave Hip Hop a bad name, and it was only a matter of time before they fell.",0
"Unfortunately, this was not the case.",1
"The CEO of the company, Brian Williams, a.k.a.",0
"Baby... the # 1 Stunna, decided to become a rapper and go solo.",0
"Hed been rapping as part of the duo of the Big Tymers, but this time has decided to rest the company's fate on his shoulders, and release Birdman in 2003.",0
"The album sucks, but it sold... everybody likes it.. and i feel like quitting rap and becoming a sniper now just to end Baby's life...",0

The production on this album is led by two main producers: Mannie Fresh and newly signed Jazze Pha.,0
"Both individuals have something in common: they are both ridiculously out of shape, and they both have no skill.",1
"Both have the same style of production as well, typically synthesized club beats and jazzy instrumentals.",0
"Using fast cellos and guitars, mixed with thumping basslines, it sounds good, but its horribly orchestrated.",0
"At times, its so loud that its unlistenable.",0
"The other producers on here are Jermaine Dupri, P. Diddy, Timbaland, and The Neptunes, which all suck.",0
"The production isnt as annoying as the lyricism, because as most of you know, commercial rappers, specially those in Cash Money, have absolutely no talent, or taste.",1
"Baby proves time and time again that he has an extreme lack of charisma, though he tries his best, and lack of talent.",0
"Even with a plethora of guest appearances and useless skits, Baby proves that there is still no way for him to put together a solid album.",1
"He is extremely unintelligent, uncreative, cliche, and frankly, extremely BORING.",0
I almost fell asleep listening to this album at how bad it is.,0
Not to mention he relies on his ridiculous birdcall.,1
"It makes me laugh that he goes on TV and thinks hes cool, when hes making himself look like a complete idiot with his wobbly movements and his attempt to dance makes him look like a piece of 80 year old jello after its been hit with a fork.",0
"The dude looks 80 too, did i mention that?",0
"Musically, Birdman has NOTHING to offer whatsoever.",0
"The sad thing is, this album has NO LISTENABLE material at all.",1
None.,1
Zero.,0
Zip.,0
Nada.,0
"The lead single from this album is the supposed"" catchy"" club song"" Do That"".",0
"We hear the words"" This is a Cash Money / Bad Boy... Collaboration"", to me, its the equivalent of hearing This is a Saddam Hussein / Osama Bin Laden Collaboration, two completely evil entities combining to give us a complete trash of a record, which makes me want to shoot the television.",0
"Sad thing is, these guys think they are"" cool"", and they are making complete fools out of themselves.",0
"Im 100 % sure that if they weren't rich, women wouldn't even look at them.",1
"I mean, asking my girlfriend Rocio, she even agreed 100 % that those guys are hideous inside and out, and its not even about looks, they are complete a**holes due to their love of money and p*ssy, which is why only greedy sluts hang out with them... makes sense doesnt it?",1
"I was recently driving along my neighborhood when i hear a young latino boy, about 13 years old, with two of his friends, doing a very gay birdcall and yelling"" What happened to dat Boy"".",0
"At this point, one word instantly entered my mind:"" Driveby"".",0
"Of course, then i remembered that i cant go to jail again, so i proceeded driving, gritting my teeth in anger and going at about 50 in a residential area.",0
My love for hip hop is truly strong.,0
"Of course, they were singing the ridiculously stupid"" What happened to that Boy"".",0
"On here, Baby brings in former-underground sell-outs The Clipse to help Baby try to rap.",0
"Baby gives us a ridiculously mediocre verse, while the Clipse raps crap also, but they admittedly have a few clever punchlines.",0
Typical rags to riches story which is ruined by Baby's ridiculously materialistic verse.,0
"Funny that on both the singles from his videos, you see him prancing around and wiggling his hands like a little girl, in which i really think that Baby is a f*ckin f*ggot.",0
"But of course, the materialism conquers this entire album.",0
"I swear to god you hear f*ckin Baby rapping about his cars, jewelry, money, and girls over and over again sooooo much that it drives you to shoot yourself literally.",0
"Baby brags about his amazing status and i guarantee you that if he comes around to my neighborhood, i will personally kick his a**, steal all his jewelry, even his teeth, and pawn the sh*t.",0
"And yes, i promise i will.... swear on my life, hed better be armed.",0
"On tracks like"" How it Be"","" Baby You Can Do It"","" Keeps Spinnin"","" On the Rocks"" and"" I Got To"", Baby stresses all of the material possessions he has, and yet hes still single... how about that.... news flash bro... they DO NOT Like you for you're personality and looks.... bro... its for you're money.",1
"But of course, he knows that... he KNOWS IT.",0
I Pray to god that some day he gets poor so he can be as miserable as we poor folks are.,0
"As usual for these pop-rappers, they have to try their best to tie to the streets and be thuggish, but of course they fail miserably.",0
"On"" Ghetto Life"","" Never Had Nothin"", and"" Heads Up"".",1
"With their horrible, mono-syllablistic, nonsensical trash lyricism and jazzy production, each of these songs mirror each other with horrible subject matter about killing and murder, and all that gay ridiculous crap which just happens to sell records to the idiotic public.",0
"Besides the fact that Baby has absolutely no skill as a lyricist, his delivery is always off-point and he f*cks up every single line he spits.",1
"His meaningless and uninspired attempt to be introspective sucks, as im very very sure that he manufactured his childhood just to be equal to other rappers... meaning he"" sold drugs"" and was a"" thug"", which i find hard to believe just like looking into his fat nasty face.",0
"Its easy to tell a liar sometimes, this guy would break a polygraph faster than id break his CD.",0
"To me, this is sooo unlistenable, its a miracle that it sells, and frankly IT P*SSES ME OFF!!!!! Everything on this album is horrible... terrible... unlistenable... what else can i say?",0
The amazing thing is that there is one competent lyricist here.,0
"On"" Say it aint so"", Keith Murray raps.",0
"He is a good lyricist, but his appearance on this album befuddles me.",0
Not to mention that the particular verse he spits is horribly materialistic and whack.,1
"Keith Murray is a great rapper, but he has no place on this album whatsoever... Say it aint so Keith... Say it aint so....",1
Is this album complete trash?,0
OH YEAH!,0
Is it worth burning in fire?,0
OH YEAH!,0
Is Birdman possibly the worst individual to even come close to a mic?,0
OH YEAH!,0
Does this man deserve absolutely no money from us whatsoever?,1
OH YEAH!,0
Is this quite possibly the worst album in the history of music?,0
OH YEAH!,0
Is Birdman a f*ckin queer?,0
OH YEAH! Do i wanna kick his a**?,0
OH YEAH!,0
Does he deserve to be stripped of his riches and live his life as a janitor?,0
OH YEAH!,0
Does he deserve to be spit on?,0
OH YEAH!,0
Nuff Said...,0
0 Stars,0
I have my own personal message towards Cash Money.,0
"Lets say you're on the internet, and you read this review, i personally challenge each and every single one of you a**holes to a battle and watch me rip you down to pieces one by one... come on... BRING IT!!!! Of course they aren't gonna respond, because as ive stated before,"" The Industry Fears Big D"".",1
"This is a part of Awoolcott's"" I Can't Believe What People Think About This!"" Write-Off..",0
Here is a shoutout to the other participants.,0
Sorry for being a Day Early Bro... but i might not be online tommorow...,1
""" Cha Cha Slide"" is the hottest group routine with hops, twists, turns and Latin Cha Cha steps at many parties and dance clubs nowadays.The inventor! is Mr.C The Slide Man ( Willie Perry Jr. a.k.a",0
Casper ) who has created this dance as an aerobic workout for a fitness club.,0
Years later a Chicago radio decided that this electric slide is what was missing from our lives and started a big promotion for it.,0
( not to forget an instructional dance video they've started advertising for ) Today little kindergarteners are dancing with their grannies to this music!,0
"Hard to speak of good, meaningful music here ( does anybody remember"" Macarena""?",0
": ), but if you just want to exercise or dance you might give it a try.",0
"There is even an instructor ( I don't know if I should call him singer,DJ or performer ) giving you the directions over a house beat:"" Slide to the left!",1
"Now, slide to the right!""",0
If you do it right it's supposed to work your whole body.,0
With nine different steps and dedicated wills this won't be a problem for us!,1
I can hardly recommend it for your wedding dance though!,0

"If you are looking for generic, rip-off rap for the holidae season then look no further than Chingy's Jackpot.",1
"Filled with senseless raps in an Steve Erkel meets Nelly cross pollinated by Snoop Dogg fashion, Chingy comes off sounding completely inane and pointless.",0
"His grating vocals are like nails on a chalkboard and even guest stars by real rappers ( Snoop Dogg, Murphy Lee ) don't keep this jackpot from going broke.",1
"Breakout single"" Right Thurr"" is supposed to be a party song for the ladies to shake their $ ss to.",0
That's all well and good until the vocals come in and ruin the beat and decent production.,0
The remix is possibly just a little bit better with the addition of Trina.,0
She provides some needed relief for Chingy audio assault.,0
"The follow up single"" Holidae In"" has a great beat and production and when Ludacris and Snoop Dogg check into the hotel I literally feel like kissing their feet in gratitude.",0
So this song is probably the best song on the album.,0
""" Wurrs My Cash"" just plain out sucks with its almost 80's production, stupid lyrics and redundant hook ( I use the term hook very loosely ).",0
It's a weak attempt to have the charisma of Snoop Dogg but it comes off once again like Erkel just stepped into the hood.,0
""" Bagg Up"" is almost palatable with its slight funky groove that is more fun than some of the other tracks.",0
He actually establishes a flow that isn't hindered by cutesy word mangling.,0
It still is pretty stagnant but at least it doesn't make me think that Chinese water torture is preferable.,1
""" One Call Away"" has a promising intro with its RandB feel but once again it deteriorates into bad reception once Chingy opens his mouth.",0
I was hopeful I would like at least one another song but I don't think that is going to happen my friends.,1
I do have to give it props for being the only track on the album that isn't mispelled.,0
Other tracks which could be describe in a creative variation of the last couple of descriptions include,0
""" He's Herre"" which rips off Kelly Rowlands"" Can't Nobody"","" Madd @ Me"" which is dedicated to the fans that bought the album,"" Represent"" ( with co-rapper Tity-Boi.",0
"I guess mispelled we aren't supposed to know what that means )the unbelievably dingy"" Juice"" ( which encourages the listeners to endulge in some freshly sqeezed hos,"" Gettin' It"" ( which makes anything by Bow Wow look mature, Chingy Jackpot and finally the eloquently titled Fu*k"" Dat N*gga"".",0
I could sit here and give you a track by track acount of this album and if you give me helpful's then I guess I will.,0
But in order to write about real music I would rather just cut to the chase.,0
If this is the jackpot then remind me to stay far away from scratch tickets and casino's.,0
I would rather sit here and languish in poverty...a poverty of sound.,0
Boston rapper Ray Benzino is one Hip-Hops most puzzling enigmas.,0
"Not satisfied with being the co-owner of one of rap musics most read magazine The Source, Benzino has been pulling double-duty for over fifteen years as a rapper, dropping albums with his group Almighty RSO, the reinvention of that same group Made Men, and as a solo artist.",1
What is puzzling about Benzinos catalogue is that there is nothing that justifies the long career - hes a mediocre rapper with an average crew at best.,0
"Even with all the highly accessible ( and arguably highly unethical ) promotion of Benzinos many projects in the various franchises of The Source, his first major hit came only last year with the popular club hit, Bootee off the album The Benzino Project.",0
"This year, the rapper returns to try to capitalize on his hit with his latest solo album, Redemption.",0
Will the album redeem Benzino in the eyes of those who doubt the validity of his career to begin with?,0
Probably not.,1

"Mario Winans, Lil Kim, and Petey Pablo",0
"With this album, Benzino hopes to make the transition from dropping just street sh*t into making club jams, evidenced by the amount of club-ready hopefuls on Redemption.",0
"Hes already scored a major success with Rock the Party,  a lively track reminiscent of Busta Rhymes and Missy Elliots wild club hoppers, showcasing syncopated jungle beats and warbling synth chords.",0
The Young Heff remix of this is also included though it s the same musically except for guest verses by Lil Kim and Petey Pablo.,0
"Ray takes more shots at a lame club hits on the grinding Get It On,  and dancehall derivative Hoola Hoop. ",0
"Fully cognizant of the importance of appealing to the XX-chromosome demographic, Redemption has two softer compositions for the ladies.",0
 I Remember  exudes a sentimental feel with Ray ruminating over a failed relationship.,0
A portion of a classic Stylistics jawn loops in the background as the rapper outlines what went wrong in the affair.,0
"Conversely, Different Kind of Lady  is Benzinos dedication to his current love, but with a twist in the lyrics that Hip-Hoppers have seen repeatedly since Common's"" I Used to Love H.E.R."" Though certainly not the first thespian to make an appearance on a rap CD, it s still unexpected to hear actress Lisa Raye ( The Players Club, The Wood ) share the mic with Ray on yet another variation on the Bonnie and Clyde love song theme, Would You. ",1
"Apparently picking up a thing or two from her time as a host on the Source: All Access television magazine, Raye sounds almost natural in the spirited duet, though the likelihood of a solo career resulting from this collabo is negligible.",0
"To be sure, there are actually a few genuinely tight tracks on Redemption.",0
"Gangstas Touch  shows the true potential of Benzinos Hangmen 3 production squad ( Benzino, Jeff Two Times, JB) with a forceful head-nodder featuring live drums, flowing orchestral strings, and harsh funk guitars.",0
"Featured emcees Cadillac Tah and Black Child are nice with their rhymes, but Benzino comes through with some truly forgettable lyrics.",0
"Def Jam South CEO and rap legend Scarface joins Benzino and M3 for more grimy rhyming on""44 Cal Killa but again, Ray is easily identified as the weakest link.",0
"Its a shame; any other skilled rapper would have tried to make a legitimate showing on these obvious album highlights, but the Boston rapper phones it in each time.",0
"Not remarkably, the weakest track on this disappointing effort is the manufactured diss track aimed at Eminem, called Pull Your Skirt Up.  Its still unknown why Benzino really decided contrive this battle between he and Em.",1
He claims it s because Slim Shady is a white so-called culture stealer  denoting his use of Hip-Hop to obtain success in mainstream audiences.,0
"However, when the purported bible of Hip-Hop Zino co-owns has recently dedicated itself too flooding its pages with bling bling and half-naked chicks galore, not to mention the fact that the other co-owner is white, what weight does his argument really have?",1
"The beef most likely is nothing but a tool for Benzino to coax a few more units of Redemption off the shelves, and promote the Hip-Hop Is Under Attack  articles in upcoming issues of The Source.",0
And the overall wretchedness of Pull Your Skirt Up reflects this flimsiness of argument.,0
The song is nothing but a poorly put together arrangement of marginally insulting couplets aimed at Slim Shady over a washed out rendition of Nas  original Jay-Z assault Ether. ,0
"Benzino attributes Mathers  success to his skin color with the line, if you were five shades darker youd be Canibus,  but it s a point Em has already conceded numerous times as with the  if I was black, I woulda sold half  line in  White America,  so it drains what little steam Benzinos diss may have had.",0
"Not satisfied to spew only at Em, the Boston rapper stings together anemic assaults on Obie Trice and D12, but wisely sidestepping 50 Cent.",1
"If this is the kind of saving  Hip-Hop needs, then the culture truly is doomed.",0
Redemption by Ray Benzino is nothing less than a prime example of why The Source magazine no longer is taken seriously in regards to Hip-Hop music and culture.,1
"If one of the chief figureheads at the mag seriously believes that this album passes as a credible effort, theres no way the issues could in anyway be representative of anything Hip-Hop.",1
"While many do dream of being a high profile rap star, many also dream of being a co-owner of a major rap publication.",0
"Benzino needs to learn to pour his passion and energy into the latter, because the rap thing sure aint working.",0
"The Demigodz; first of all, what exactly is a Demigod?",0
"According to Webster himself, he states that a Demigod is a person who is partly divine.",0
"If that is really the case, then this group of 10+ MCs must be hiding their latent skills until the LP drops.",0
"Just from me perceiving through 7 tracks, I have yet to unveil any divine  qualities from any of these musicians.",0
"Unfortunately, these MCs are too obsessed with their little punchlines and battling skills, and therefore throwing away every other component that is integral in making a good and complete album.",0
"So, unless if the producer of your group is named Stoupe, Primo, 4th Disciple, or Rza, an EP full of battle verses is what would be called skating on thin ice.",0
"The producer of Demigodz Entertainment happens to be Apathy ( the guy who first appeared on that Jedi Mind Tricks album ), and although his production is dogged and elaborate, it s nowhere near Godlike.",0
The two MCs that make themselves known right off the bat is Apathy and Celph Titled.,0
"Apathy is brash, candor, and just plain mean when it comes to spitting lyrics.",0
Celph Titled has the voice of a mean cartoon character and can land more than a few clever punchlines.,0
"These two compliments each other on the first track Science of the Bumrush, and flexes their tongue muscles by throwing up some heavy punchlines:",0
In fact the same fist that I hit you up with,0
Was found inside your b*tchs clitor*s after sucked my d*ck,0
"Youre just a g*y rapper, loving what them f*gs do",0
You aint had pu*sy since pu*sy had you,0
Get outta line and Ill draw you a chalk outline,0
I heard you did a track with Puff Daddy and got outshined,0
Esoteric actually does a favor this time by showing up on Captivate/Deactivate.,0
"The chopped up string samples are just insane, along with a colorful hook done by using samples from Big Pun to Raekwon.",0
"I especially liked it when Apathy playfully provoked Esoteric by asking Yo Eso, tellem why you bringing the pain son?, then Eso responded with its probably getting done as we speak like Jenna Jameson. ",0
Apathy also brought the pain himself with one of the best punchlines I have ever heard: You think you can battle me and win?,0
Next plan/ Cuz theres a better chance of Eminem joining X-Clan! ,0
"The pages in the Demigodz  rhyme book were probably invaded by the pens of Apathy and Celph Titled, leaving very little lines and spaces for the 11 other members.",0
"To experience the official Demigod sound, just skip to the final song on here as all of the MCs show up and boasts their skills.",0
You should get a rise after hearing MC Rise as he delivered a unique verse:,0
"The crowd is out for ya set, they aint respect",0
"They aint happy you wrecked, they happy you left",0
"They mad upset, pis*ed that they for your rhyming",0
"They barely survived your set, families hugging and crying",0
"Dont come back, the rap competition s getting hurt up",0
"Beat within an inch of your life, then beat you one inch further",0
Parental Discretion is definitely advised.,0
"The rest of what this EP had to offer was nt very different from what I had reviewed, with the exception of You Dont Wanna Go There, which had the best beat ( Latin guitar riffs and an ill sample ) on the album.",1
"My experiment with this EP was nt very fond, believe it or not, it actually left me fazed.",1
Sure it had a few good songs with superman Apathy behind the boards and Celph Titled slashing his tongue of steel.,0
However they need to do A LOT more than just a few good beats and a few decent punchlines if they ever want to be the real Demigodz of the music industry.,0
Reviewing a CD is going to be really difficult for me.,0
I don't even know here to start!,1
"So, instead of categorizing like usual, I'll probably just type out paragraphs and how it is somewhat organized.",0
"So, wondering about the title eh?",0
"You know those songs you always hear on the radio, that sound spectacular and a couple of other songs by the same singer gets popular?",0
"I'll assume you do, and I'll also assume you go out to buy the CD expecting the same quality o f songs, only to be highly disappointed.",0
"This is the exact same case here, as it is with Confessions of Fire.",0
"IMO, Cam'Ron has become legendary to this.",0
"He has one or two amazingly popular songs, then the rest of the CD sucks.",0
"The hit song in Confessions of Fire was"" Horse and Carriage"" featuring Ma$ e.",0
"Of course, back then there was no Napster, KaZaa or Morpheus, and that was just a few years ago.",1
Amazing how much the internet has changed music.,0
"The hit in Come Home With Me is"" Hey Ma"", a mellow rap song with awesome lyrics.",0
"So, I bought the song on iTunes Music Store, and I love it.",0
"It is my second highest played song, only behind"" Don't Stop Til' You Get Enough"", by Michael Jackson.",0
I bought the CD because I have always like Cam'Ron's style.,0
"After the death of Tupac and B.I.G., the sellout of P. Diddy, and the retirement of Jay Z, I crave for good ol' rap.",0
"I am talking about the Gangsta rap of the early 90's, as opposed to the crap Nelly, Eminem and 50 Cent sh!t out.",0
I mean the crap aimed towards fourteen year olds.,0
"Back in the early 90s, if an underaged kid played rap, like"" Hit Em Up"", they would inadvertently pee their pants because of the feeling in the lyrics.",0
Now that has all changed.,0
"So, aware of Cam'Ron's new CD, and impressed by his single,"" Hey Ma"", I bought the whole CD at iTunes Music Store for around $ 10.00US.",0
"Luckily I did not pay full retail price, which would have probably been $ 15.",1
The CD SUCKED.,0
"Besides"" Hey Ma"" which I have two copies of, and"" Oh Boy"", the rest of the CD is poor music with just as bad lyrics.",0
"( No offense Cam'Ron, I'm still a big fan! )",0
Cons,0
"This is another example of why people"" share"" music.",0
"You put a couple of good songs on the CD, and the rest sounds like it was there to fill the void.",0
"The lyrics suck, and the beat is in no way catchy.",1
"Try singing along to"" Come Home with Me"".",0
You can't!,1
No rhythmic style.,1
Nothing you can feel out of the song!,1
"Out of the fifteen tracks on the CD, their are two that I play.",0
"The lyrics aren't smooth, and the beat isn't catchy.",1
That is basically the bottom line.,0
Not much detail can be given besides the fact that the CD sucks for those two reasons.,1
Cam'Ron hasn't had a huge fit for a long time now.,1
"He did do a remix of"" Horse and Carriage"", which was okay.",0
"It seemed kind of desperate, but of course many artists do remixes.",0
Rarely are they as good as the first.,0
"With the quality of the original song in this case, I don't think anyone expected it to be.",1
"Again, the songs sound like they were whipped together to fill up space as to make it different from a single.",0
Pros,0
"Despite most of the downfalls, Cam'Ron is a great lyricist, especially when his songs have a great beat.",0
"Songs he has put out like"" Horse and Carriage"", easily puts Cam'Ron on the Top 40 Rappers of all time list.",0
""" Hey Ma"", is a perfect example.",0
"With a mellow rhythm, it is perfect for night drives and stuff.",0
"Very soothing, for a rap song at least.",0
""" Hey Ma"" is a perfect example of how great rap was in the 90's.",0
"For example, during the chorus they talk to each other with things like,"" What's up, All right"".",0
Pure 90's.,0
"They also pass back to each other:"" Got drops, got Coups, got Trucks, got juice, all right.""",0
Perfect.,0
Absolutely perfect.,0
You can't ask for a better song than this.,0
"Another popular song is Oh Boy, which is kind of weird but still counts as good music.",0
"Those two songs, and Cam'Ron's consistent style throughout the CD is what gives it two stars, as opposed to one.",0
Cam'Ron has a very original and classy style that you can listen to over and over again.,0
Conclusion,0
"Don't buy the CD, but definitely buy the song,"" Hey Ma"".",0
It is well worth the 99 Cents that iTunes Music Store charges.,0
"If you don't want to download iTunes, try BuyMusic.com.",1
""" Oh Boy"" isn't bad either.",1
"I really hope Cam'Ron keeps up his style and doesn't follow the"" Nelly"" trend.",1
"Hey, if he does, he'll always have listeners.",0
"The real rap fans will listen, and really appreciate the music.",0
"Right now, Cam'Ron IMO is one of the best living/non-retired rappers.",0
Hopefully he keeps up the good work and style,0
"Cam'Ron's last CD was better, even though it was basically the same,""one good song"" story.",0
"That one good song though, is really good.",0
Worth ten bucks?,0
Probably not.,1
Worth a buck?,0
Easily.,0
I would like to start off by saying this album is straight WHACK!!!,0
Why would any of you want an album where all you here is how much money,0
he has??,0
People who rap about their personal possesions have no respect for hiphop.,1
Hiphop is an artform which was NOT meant to be made money off of.,1
I could care less how many damn cars or jewels he has.,0
I'd rather listen to an album that doesn't state how much sh*t you got or an album about killing the most people or smoking te most weed.,1
"Why don't you all do yourself a favour and goto to your local underground hiphop store and purchase an album that was mad for strictly flows, strictly skillz, and strictly hiphop.",1
peace,0
DaBrat is a girl/lady/whatever - so why doesn't she act like it?,1
"With her brazen, rough tones and word choice, she doesn't sound very ladylike to me.",1
"Not that she tries to act like a lady...Just as most other female rappers ( Missy Elliott, Eve, Amil ), she doesn't seem to have much originality.",1
Nor is there much distinction between her songs.,1
Most all of the 17 tracks sound the same.,0
What is wrong with rap these days?,0
"In general, rap has lost so much of its meaning.",0
"It used to be purely lyrical genious, but nowadays, with the progression of rap merging into some pop/rock, it has totally changed.",0
You can now hear tunes from DMX being played on pop radio stations.,0
You can hear ODB on pop stations.,0
Is there anything wrong with a pop station playing it?,0
Nope.,0
But it affects the production and composition of rap songs.,0
The stereotype of rap used to be that hard-core gangsta rap stuff that almost no caucasian people wanted to listen to.,1
"As the years pass, it changes, and more and more white people like rap.",0
Why?,0
It has altered some of its style and sound to accomodate others.,0
"No offense, but white influence on""black"" music isn't good.",1
"Also, lyrical genious in rap nowadays tends to go along the lines of"" f*ck you"" and"" suck my __ __.""",0
"What's happened to the awesome rhymes and, well, less profane side of rap? Society has made this every-other-word-is-f*ck music into the norm.",0
Rarely will you listen to a rap song without the colorful language in it.,1
Back to DABRAT...,0
DaBrat seems to have been using a mini-version of Webster's when she and her co-writers wrote those songs.,0
"Not only do they recycle all the same words, the lyrics have no deep meaning.",1
"Unlike many other rap artists, she seems to just be rapping for the heck of it.",0
It's worse than Britney Spears.,0
"DaBrat also has a voice similar to Britney's - strained, throaty, and squeaky.",0
"It is very painful to listen to, at times, and her redundancy does get on my nerves.",0
Track 1 - Intro,0
The intro is so useless because it is basically celebrating the return of DaBrat.,0
"However, I'll give her a few brownie points because of the excellent rap skills showed here.",0
She can rap so fast and clear - a great feat of skill.,0
"The tune is very boring, but it suffices.",0
"Here and there you can pick up some lyrics, but it's hard to because of the speed they rap.",0
Track 2 - We Ready,0
I never said I was ready!,1
": ) Again, the tune isn't great.",1
"In fact, it's horrible.",0
"It sounds like something Dr. Dre would use, especially if his music were like TQ or something.",0
This music doesn't fit the lyrics or the voice.,1
Too soft music for too harsh a voice.,0
"There is barely a tune, actully, so I take back the part of the tune not being great.",1
"Ther are 3 notes in the tune, that's it.",0
"Not much to look forward to, if you ask me.",1
"It's a bit slow for dancing, but it's not something you would grind to, either.",1
Track 3 - What You Like featuring Tyrese.,0
This is the EXACT same tune as Montell Jordan - Get it On Tonight.,0
Why?,0
I dunno.,0
But the lyrics don't fit.,0
"Also, she altered the tune so that half the accompaniment sounds are missing.",0
She and Tyrese do a bad job handling the lyrics and the presentation of the lyrics.,0
"Their voices clash so badly - she has a high, throaty, forced voice.",0
"Tyrese has a Montell-type voice - smooth, flowing, euphonious.",0
A good voice and bad voice don't cancel each other out - they make the situation worse.,0
"The lyrics are, again, worthless.",0
"There's no point in singing this - it tells basically the same type of story the rest of the songs do - except, story isn't the word to describe it.",1
Track 4 - At the Club,0
This isn't even a song - it's like a skit.,1
It's also 37 seconds long.,0
"This has no point - it talks about DaBrat""blowing things out of proportion"" and getting mad at this guy.",1
It's pretty boring.,0
They basically quibble over her tendency to be incited into anger and let her temper take over.,0
Track 5 - F*ck You,0
The tune sounds like some Jamaican tin drum tune.,0
"It also sounds a bit like the Rugrats song, for some reason.",0
The beat isn't that great - similar to the other songs.,0
The bass line doesn't sound complete - more like little fragments pieced together.,1
The lyrics are a bit harsh - not that her others aren't.,1
I just am not used to hearing the female type using such abrasive words.,1
This is no good for dancing.,1
Track 6 - Back Up,0
A song featuring Ja Rule - I hate him too!,0
It's basically the same note in the background being repeated over and over again.,0
"JaRule says""baby"" every once in a while.",0
DaBrat's voice still sticks out a little compared to the mellower tones of the xylophone-type instrument used in the background tune.,0
"Then, the chorus has this nasal sound that makes it altogether painful to hear.",0
Another song that isn't decent for dancing.,1
Track 7 - Hands in da Air,0
"A song with Mystikal, this is horrible.",0
The background has trumpet tunes that sound like somehing you'd here on Hawaii or Matlock.,0
One of the old shows.,0
"However, with the modern-type sound of her voice and lyrics, the song sounds a little strange.",0
"All in all, the lyrics aren't great, because it basically has the same theme as all the other songs - NONE.",1
Track 8 - Runnin Out of Time,0
"This time, DaBrat has paired up with Kelly Price.",0
"Kelly has a nice voice, a little like Toni Braxton crossed with Whitney Houston.",0
DaBrat sounds virtually the exact opposite.,0
"This is not that great for the song because it takes attention from areas of the song that want attention, and directs the attention to the voice.",1
"Rather than focus on appreciating the song, DaBrat seems to have decided to write crapppy lyrics again, coupled with a shallow""melody.""",0
Track 9 - That's What I'm Lookin For,0
"If there is one, this is the prime of the CD.",0
"This song, although quite characteristic of this crapppy DaBrat style, has a decent tune, and it is great for dancing/whatever.",0
"It has a good, steady beat that is fit for moving around.",0
I even play basketball to this song ( it is on a mix ).,0
"I think that the voice and tune and lyrics come together very well, as opposed to all the other songs on this CD.",0
It doesn't clash at all - a good sign.,1
"The cuss words are still rampant, and the rhymes a bit weak, but overall, the lyrics are a little better than in other songs.",0
Track 10 - Breeve on Em featuring 22,0
"This sounds like a cross between Eminem -"" My Name is"" and Puff DAddy -"" It's all about the Benjamins.""",0
"The voice and music do blend, somewhat, but I think the song just isn't what it could be.",1
"Take 22 out, and change some lyrics, and maybe you can salvage this one.",0
Track 11 - What's On Your Mind,0
Nothing is on her mind.,1
"That's why this song is absolutely horrifying, and I am too predictable, so you probably can infer what I'll tell you.",0
Track 12 - Leave Me Alone,0
another skit!,0
It's 15 seconds long this time.,0
It's supposed to be a phone call that I won't bother to explain - the title pretty much sums it up.,1
Track 13 - High Come Down,0
Another 80's-sounding song.,0
"Sheesh, this is getting boring.",0
This is no goodfor dancing because it's too slow - too fastr for grinding!,1
haha.,0
"The chorus doesn't fit because the person singing it has a smooth, mellow voice, but the lyrics are so coarse you'd think DaBrat can sing them herself.",1
The only thing is - she can't sing.,1
Track 14 - All My B*tches,0
All my b_tches say that THIS SONG STINKS.,0
She basically yells through the beginning.,0
"Then, she has about 3 other people helping her.",0
"The beat is good, the rapping is good ( speed, skill... ).",0
"However, the lyrics are kind of hard to catch, and when they are heard, they aren't great.",1
The lyrics have no real point to them.,1
This is ok for dancing.,0
Track 15 - Pink Limonade,0
The tune is barely there - another one of those 2-note melodies.,0
"This has a dull sound, but then when you hear DaBrat's voice, it makes you want to cringe.",0
"This is ok for dancing, although I wouldn't ever get up and dance to this one.",0
Track 16 - Bishop Don Juan,0
Another phone call - totally worthless.,0
""" Bishop Don Juan"" is a pimp.",0
He's basically advertising.,0
Track 17 - Chi Town,0
This song is absolutely terrible.,0
It sounds like what you'd get if you crossed Michael Jackson with Eve.,0
"The tune sounds so retrospective - 80's or early 90's - and the lyrics are so"" today"" that it sounds ridiculous.",0
"Not only that, as you can see, all her songs don't have much of a theme or point to them.",1
They don't seem to be well thought out.,1
It seems to me like she is merely rapping just because.,0
No reason!,1
"This song talks about Chicago"" Chi Town,"" the city"" with the best skylines"" where DaBrat grew up, etc. etc. etc.",0
We didn't really ask to hear her life story.,1
"Not only does this song have no point, it's so worthless that all it basically talks about Chicago's people doing drugs, bad things about the city, how she fits in with the people, and encourages the drug use there.",1
Whoop-dee-doo.,0
Final thought - this is a waste of 14.99 at a record store.,0
I bought this album when I read an artical in Rolling Stones magizine.,0
I still think I should have waited until I found it in a store that sells used CDs.,0
Maybe then I would have thought it was worth the money.,0
The album was supposed to be a movement toward feminest hip-hop... it din't make it.,1
There is one track that I really like though.,0
It is Da Brat with Kelly Price.,0
It is soulful and thought out.,0
I don't like that in this album she sells her body instead of her talent.,1
This CD is similar to Missy Elliots and Foxy Brown.,0
There is only one real diffrence.,0
"This album isn't that good, and those other 2 are.",0
It is WAY diffrent than her first... so don't buy this album if you want the same old same old.,0
"Buy this album new if you have money to burn, or if you want an entire collection of female hip-hop artists and this one puts you all the way there.",0
"If you are looking for a good female album, buy Missy instead.",0
"I first started listening to rap in the early 1990s, when members of my peer group, Kris Kross were the hottest act going.",0
"It was obvious that the 2 kids in Kris Kross had no talent whatsoever, just used as marketing objects to make rap appeal to the young crowd in America.",1
"The idea with Kris Kross was to give them a squeaky clean image, with a thugged out look and sound.",0
"Obviously when one thing real, and one thing fake collide, and you have the ultimate phasing out of this music.",0
What does this have to do with Shyne?,0
"Absolutely nothing, that was a brief introduction to a situation that occurs in rap known as being a"" studio gangsta"".",0
Studio gangstas are the lowest form of human beings in the rap game.,0
"Shyne falls into the category of studio gangsta, because he claims he was a poor kid on the streets of Brooklyn, who never sold a record in his life.",1
"Yet he has a song on his album called"" That's Gangsta"", quite possibly the worst rap song of all time.",0
"That's Gangsta has Shyne bsing the rap world about he is a true street thug, he's dodged the cops, and he has 100 carats in his watch.",0
"If Shyne has 100 carats in his watch, before he had a job, and he got it from street hustling, the FBI would investigate the purchase of 100 carats worth of diamonds, and Shyne would obviously be jailed for the reason that he cannot explain where his source of funds originated.",1
"Rather than go deeper into speaking of this horrible fraudulent piece of rap music, I will go on to his next song, and equally deplorable attempt to try and tell you Shyne is something he's not.",1
"Shyne first debuted on the radio with a song called Bad Boy, featuring Barrington Levy, an unknown reggae star who only existed in the underground world.",0
"Shyne too, only existed in the underground world until this album was released.",0
"His songs like Guch, Prad, on the horrible Cutmaster C underground release brought me to believe that Shyne had no future, and my instincts were correct.",1
"Bad Boy is nothing more than a sappy attempt to convince the American hip hop listening audience that Shyne is more than just a rapper, he had to earn his keep on the streets, and he is still doing so.",1
"Don't fall for it, Shyne is nothing more than a really bad actor, and a pathetic attempt to match the superior lyrical stylings, of one, Biggie Smalls.",1
"Perhaps what is considered one of the worst publicity stunts of all time, and the stupidest career move Shyne could make, Shyne was indicted for the infamous club shooting at a party, thrown by the head of Bad Boy Records, Puff Daddy.",0
"To pump the upcoming debut of Shyne's album, it was rumored that Shyne was the shooter in this party, the one that Puffy and Jennifer Lopez fled from to avoid possibly being shot at.",0
"Now, lets point out the obvious.",0
Puffy who signs Shyne promises to make him millions because his record will be sent straight to the top through his promotions.,0
Puff also takes Shyne in despite his ongoing fued with long time friend and partner Lil Kim.,0
"So, Shyne, the shooter?",0
"I think not, just a shameless attempt to push an album that has no reason to ever be shelved.",1
Shyne is one of the great travesties of rap music.,0
"He has a horrible voice for the business, a look similar to that of Warren G, who hasn't been popular since the mid 90's, and is obviously just a cheap Biggie imitation.",1
"If it was up to me, his album wouldn't even go double wood, but it has sold somewhere in the area of almost reaching gold status, which is pretty pathetic.",1
"I think if people put blindfolds on and take the earplugs out, they will realize what type of garbage Shyne is delivering.",0
"I put that this is Great Music to Play While Getting ready to go out, because hearing this garbage makes you want to leave as fast as possible.",0
Warning: This opinion is very graphic.,0
It is intended for adults.,0
Minors should not read this opinion.,1
"I have used */SYM to make some of the content"" clean"" but feel that I needed to include the profanity in order to illustrate what I was referring to.",0
"I hope that no one is offended by this opinion, and if they are, I sincerely apologize.",1
Let me preface this opinion by stating I have never before had a problem with profanity in music.,1
I have always preferred to buy the unedited versions of CDs.,0
"Having seen the video for"" Get Your Roll On"" on BET, I thought I'd enjoy this CD.",0
I liked the beat and liked the lyrics.,0
"Yet, when I listened to the same song on the CD, I was shocked.",0
It sounded like an almost completely different song.,0
"As I already stated, I've never been one to get offended by profanity in music.",1
A lot of my favorite artists use profanity in their lyrics.,0
"However, I believe that there is a way to do it so it blends well in the music.",0
Apparently Big Tymers are not familiar with that technique.,1
"Big Tymers sprinkle curse words in their lyrics in places where not only is it not necessary, but it detracts from the rhythm.",1
"Instead of the lyrics flowing, as with Ice Cube or Dr Dre, Big Tymers' lyrics have a stutter quality to them that makes listening to the songs unenjoyable.",0
Here are some examples of what I am talking about.,0
"These lyrics were all taken from the song,"" Get Your Roll On"".",0
""" Everybody Get Your Roll On,",0
"Everybody Get Your Mother F**king Roll On""",0
"That is the chorus, it is said four times.",0
The chorus is said many times throughout the song.,0
Other lyrics are:,0
""" Slap that b**ch,",0
"Punch that hoe.""",0
""" Big d**ks we slang,",0
"Freak b**ch do your thang, do your thang.""",0
""" Your wife is,",0
My baby momma.,0
"God d**n, mother f**ker,",0
"She's a good d**k s**ker.""",0
"While some rappers incorporate profanity into their songs in a way that is seamless and doesn't stand out, the Big Tymers have not mastered the art yet.",1
They've put profanity and insults in their music in places that would have flowed much better without them.,1
"This was proven by watching the video for"" Get Your Roll On"" on BET.",0
"The lyrics in the video flowed and between that and the beat, I couldn't just sit and watch.",0
I had to get up and dance in front of the TV.,0
"The beats and rhythm on the CD are still booming, and such that you will want to dance to them and bob your head to the music.",0
"But if you're like me, you will wish there was a switch on your stereo that would allow you to cut the lyrics out and just listen to the rhythm.",0
"The feel I got from this album is that Big Tymers were trying to copy Ice Cube and Dr Dre and other Gangsta Rappers' styles, and failed miserably.",0
"If you like Gangsta and Hardcore Rap, read my review of Ice Cube's new album,"" War and Peace: Vol 2 ( The Peace Album )"".",0
"My recommendation on this album,"" I Got That Work"" by Big Tymers, is either get the edited version, or just pass it up, and save the money that you worked for.",0
My roommate is into the whole jiggy  rapper routine and I am decidedly against it.,0
He wanted me to download the new Fabolous album because it was hot. ,0
"Let me tell you, whatever hot  is, it has to be synonymous with crap. ",0
"My tastes lie in the underground, where most true hip hop artists remain.",0
"These artists never see the success that mainstream rappers have, which can good and bad at the same time.",1
"Usually when a hip hop artist sticks to the underground, they stick with what got them into the game in the first place (usually thoughtful rhymes, but not always. )",1
"When one of these artists decides to jump the ladder into mainstream acceptance, they drop any resemblance of a hip hop artist and become whor*s of the music industry, molding themselves to what sells.",0
I have developed a step by step theory by which hip hop artists can follow in order to change into jiggy rappers.,0
"Basically, what it takes to become a mainstream rapper nowadays is:",0
"a ) Catchy, jiggy, club friendly beats ( 50 Cents  In Da Club  comes to mind ).",0
"b ) Generic subject matter about hos, cash, violence, sex, and drugs.",0
c ) A major label able to pay off MTV and payola radio stations.,0
Thats the step by step process.,0
"You might be thinking, just three steps?",0
"Yes, my friend, that s all it takes.",0
"Of course not everyone makes it and not every mainstream rapper is like this, but typically, this outline is pretty all encompassing.",1
Examples abound of such rappers.,0
One such rapper is Fabolous.,0
His album Street Dreams is an example of a mainstream creation.,0
"Remember the process, ladies and gents, youll see it comes in very handy.",0

On To the Review,0
This album is very generic and reminiscent of most mainstream rap.,0
Example: the Intro.,0
"It serves absolutely no point except to take up space ( a filler track, if you will. )",1
DJ Clue basically says how everyone wants to be like his boy Fabolous and how everyone wants his life.,0
Already the album starts off with negative marks.,0
"The first actual song, Not Give a F***, follows the first two letters in my step by step process to a tee.",0
"A deep, rubbery bass-line pounds away accompanied by some very basic, grating snare and bells.",0
This satisfies ( a ) of my process to mainstream success.,0
"The beat is a typical club-ready creation, perfect for accompanying Fabolous  lyrics.",0
These following lyrics exemplify part ( b ) of my method.,0
"I'm fly enough, to do better,",0
"But pimp enough to not give a f***,",0
"And I'm thug enough, to do better,",0
"And gangsta enough to not give a f***,",0
"I'm hustlin' enough, to know better,",0
"But ballin' enough to not give a f***,",0
"And I'm, old enough, to know better,",0
But young enough to not give a f***,0
I think the lyrics speak for themselves.,0
"Damn incorporates a female singer as the hook, a shameful mainstream tactic popularized by the wack artist know as Ja Rule.",0
"This song reminds me of the Saturday Night Live skit with Christopher Walken, where he is a producer of a band.",0
""" Guess what?  he proclaims.",0
 I got a fever!,0
"And the only prescription... is more cowbell!""",0
"Funny stuff, but very applicable to this mainstream monstrosity of a song.",0
Cowbells pervade throughout the song.,0
"Over and over, the same sample is used, to the point where the listener just wants to skip the song, or kill himself.",0
"The lyrics dont say anything either, which is to be expected.",1
I cant help but think of Puff Daddy ( P.,1
"Diddy ) when listening to Call Me, or any song for that matter.",0
"Although Fabolous  flow is much better than P Diddys, there is no escaping the fact that he sounds almost exactly the same, voice and tone wise.",1
This song is about a girl that wants him to call her because they had such great sex together.,0
Wow! How creative.,0
Next,0
The next song Cant Let You Go uses Nellys rhyming of thank ya and gangsta. ,0
And I respect ya gangsta,0
Treat you like a princess,0
And put something on your neck to thank ya,0
This fact alone automatically submits it in the worst song of the album  category.,0
"Essentially the song is about how he has a girlfriend and how much he likes having sex with her, but cant leave his wife.",0
"This is an extremely misogynistic track that s hidden in a glossy, acoustic guitar laced beat along with Lil Mo and Mike Shorleys strong singing.",0
Bad B*tch also borrows rhymes from another album.,0
"This time it s from The Clipse song, Lets Talk About It.",0
The lyrics are along the lines of having fun with two girls.,0
"The track, production wise, is repetitive and unintelligent.",0
This perfectly compliments the wack lyrics.,0
"Yeah, I'm a Ghetto Superstar ni**a",0
"Most ni**as trying to get one chick, right?",0
I'm trying to get two,0
"You know, two is always better than one, right?",0
Yeah..,0
"Why Would nt I also continues this charade of wack, pointless, misogynistic, money hungry, women objectifying tirade.",0
"This time Fab is joined by an unknown rapper, Paul Cain.",0
"Cain is even guiltier than Fabolous, since he assists Fab in continuing his moronity.",0
"I never thought I would say anything like this, but I actually like one of the songs on the album.",1
"Up On Things presents nothing new or exciting, but the piano driven, synth backed beat is very infectious.",0
"Snoop Dogg shows up for the chorus and some extremely pointless lyrics, but his presence is refreshing in a self-parody sort of way.",0
This Is My Party just plain sucks.,0
"The beat is horrible, Fabolous  rhymes are weak, and the chorus is completely and utterly wack!",0
Skip at all costs!,0
"Ashanti stars on Into You, an attempt of introspection that goes horribly wrong.",0
"Apparently, Fab is attempting to be real with a girl, but all he does is talk about how much money he has and how hes greater than anyone else.",0
What is this crap?,0
"Essentially, it would be a waste of time for me to continue my review, considering the fact that the rest of the songs follow the same routine of recycled subject matter, beats, and complete lack of talent/creativity.",0
It seems to me that this entire album is just a lame attempt at making money.,0
Every track is below average.,0
"If Fabolous does nt step up his game and does nt drops the clichs, hes never going to be played in my play list, that s for sure.",1
"First of all the Biggie issue,"" Similarities in my voice ni**a check the words.""-Shyne.",0
"Yes, on first hearing Shyne's voice you may think of Biggie, but upon hearing the rest of the album you'll have forgotten all about the the very little similarity, if you haven't you have issues.",1
"The difference between Shyne and Biggie, besides the younger and healthier voice of Shyne, is that Biggie was a studio gangsta' where as Shyne is for real.",0
"Biggie even said it himself in an interview, he sits with friends and takes their experiences and makes them into songs.",0
"You can feel Shyne's album is real, you hear it in his voice, in his lyrics and you can see it in his eyes.",0
He has many scars to prove his battles both inside and out.,0
"Trust me besides the lyrics, which Shyne writes himself, you have the hottest beats to hit a hip-hop album in a while.",0
"Shyne shows how versatile he is by rapping to fast jungle beats, slow""love"" songs, and all those bass pumping tunes.",0
Trust me when I'm driving and I need something to hype me up I throw in the Shyne c.d. because it's truly hot.,0
"Big Tymers'"" I Got That Work"" is one of my new favorite rap",0
CD's.,0
It has a wide range of moods with songs that are slow,0
and songs that are fast paced and hard.,0
Great for a loud car,0
stereo system but equally at home in your living room stereo.,0
"Big Tymers, ( featuring Lil wayne and juvenile on most tracks )",0
talk mainly about the amount of money they have on this CD.,0
It kind of raises your spirits to hear that there are people,0
in this world that can buy some of the things that these guys,0
own.,0
It has it's fair share of swearing ( which never bothers,1
me ) but it's done tastefully even though it's a hardcore rap,0
"Not for kids, but great for all else.",0
I bought it because,0
"my friend introduced me to one of it's premiere tracks..."" Get",0
"Your Roll On"" by far the best track.",0
The only thing I wish was,0
different was that... it never ended.,1
"If you like Juvenile,",0
"B.G., Hot Boyz, or the 504 Boys, then this CD will fit right",0
into your musical collection.,0
"while i usually don't convince myself to just BUY cd's because it's a sophomore effort, fabolous was a little different.",1
his first album was something that maybe one friend bought and we ALL listened to it indifferently.,0
"in other words, it didn't have the same power as LINKIN PARK'S debut ( i couldn't stop listening to HYBRID THEORY ).",1
"then between albums 1 and 2, fabolous made some great songs that never were really released.",1
"one of my favorites is a song called"" just don't stop"", featuring a great beat and interesting flows.",0
"as i listened to online stuff from dj clue's mixtapes, i gained a better appreciation for his music.",0
"well, as STREET DREAMS came out, i felt the sudden urge to buy it and pop in.",0
this is what i think over a month after buying it:,0
2. not give a f***: it's just one of those songs that you say would be great if it just had a different beat.,0
i mean his lyrics have some humor to them.,0
"one of my favorite lines goes along the lines of""i'm here to take away your meal, almost like it's RAMADAN"".",0
"3. damn: this is the song you listen to one the way to a party or club, or anywhere that's high energy.",0
"the beat feels goofy to me, but i still like the song as a whole.",0
"i think it's one of the top songs, of course if it wasn't made into a single.",1
4. call me: another top song ( which i hope doesn't turn into a single ) along with # 3.,1
great song reflecting FAB's average day.,0
"unlike 50 CENT singing his own chorus(es ) in his cd GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN', FAB smartly chose to have girls sing the chorus with bits of FAB himself talking.",0
"definitely a smart move by"" THE KID"".",0
"5. can't let you go: a reunion with""SUPERWOMAN"" singer LIL' MO, and i'd describe this song as one of the best recent hip hop""love songs"" ( i use love loosely on this one ).",1
"when you listen closely, it's about that girl that's his""other girl"" besides his wifey.",0
""" cuz the entree ain't as good without somethin on the side"" is one of those lines that i'm just gonna remember no matter what.",1
"6. bad b****: a cool song, but i wouldn't use it for anything more than a party dance song.",0
it's one of those times that the songs really don't apply to most of the world.,1
"""i got a bad b**** on my left side, bad b**** on my right side""... come on FAB, that's what i call a"" street dream""!",0
"7. why wouldn't i: for some reason, i'd have to say i wish FAB would've dumped this song's beat for something better.",0
"actually, i wish the whole song was dumped.",0
enough said.,0
8. up on things: featuring snoop dogg.,0
"fab uses a little bit of west coast flavor, almost making it a continuation of dr.",0
"dre's"" still d.r.e."".",0
"great cruising song, not really a party song.",1
"9. sickalicious: as much as i like missy on her OWN songs, she doesn't really sound right on this song.",1
"i think the lyrics are tight, but the beat needed to be something COMPLETELY different.",0
"10. this is my party: his first single, no review required!",1
"11. into you: great use of ashanti, as she makes # 4 CALL ME sound better and sweeter.",0
i guess this could be the next good hip hop love song.,0
"one of my favorites, as FAB slows down and makes one girl the object of the song as opposed to street dreaming about the all night sex parties.",0
"12. change you or change me: for some reason, i really DON'T like this song.",1
"i don't know why, but i think it's just too slow of a beat underneath funky flows.",1
"15. never duplicated: a cool lil song to bump in the ride or a party, has a bit of neptunes sounds in it, which always makes songs better.",1
"i think if anyone says his flows are better on this album, a lot of it is on this song.",0
17. my life: a classic 90's sounding song featuring mary j. blige on the ENTIRE chorus.,0
"sounds like j. lo's"" all i have"" song, but more""hip hop-ified"".",0
"i wish this song DOESN'T get released, because i think it would get worn out pretty quickly.",0
"there are some more songs on this album, but i think i well represented most of the good ( and some bad ) songs.",0
"FAB has much improved his flows, quit spelling his name ( as mentioned in a scene of his TRADE IT ALL 2 video ), and didn't make the whole album a series of guest spots.",1
"it could've been made a lil better, but so can everything.",0
hope this review was helpful!,0
You know it when you hear it.,0
Your toes start tapping.,0
Your head starts bobbing.,0
And it doesn't even matter if the lyrics are wack; the beat has you hypnotized.,1
"From Justin Timberlake to Nelly, Ludacris to Britney Spears, to everything else on your FM dial: you know a Neptunes track when you hear one.",0
"The Neptunes are by far the hottest producers in hip hop, putting their stamp on the industry by making hot joints for nearly every major artist out right now.",0
"From every corner of pop and hip pop, the music industry's envelope has been pushed by the forward thinking of super producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo.",0
"With their recent release,"" The Neptunes Present: Clones,"" the Neptunes showcase up-and-coming artists from their Star Trak label while getting help from some of the hottest names in hip hop, making for a killer compilation of fresh beats featuring the Neptunes' signature sound.",0
"Busta Rhymes starts the album off with the club banger"" Light Your A$ $ On Fire.""",0
Busta spits verse after verse about seriously lighting a girl's backside aflame over a hypnotic dance beat.,0
"N.O.R.E. also gets a similarly trance-like beat to rhyme over on"" Put Em Up.""",0
"With a catchy chorus, N.O.R.E.",0
"replicates his"" Superthug"" success from years ago.",0
"Pharrell himself appears on a number of tracks, including his own single,"" Frontin"" featuring Jay-Z.",0
"But the album is less focused on Pharrell or anyone else's vocals; the beats outshine most of the verbal performances on"" Clones,"" with a few exceptions.",0
"Ludacris spits fluidly on"" It Wasn't Us,"" a track featuring a broken hip hop beat reminicent of his early Neptunes-blessed track,"" Southern Hospitality.""",1
The song is not only a standout in terms of the Neptunes' contribution; it is also one of the few on the album that have lyrics solid enough to accompany the amazing beat.,1
"Nas also comes through on"" Popular Thug,"" with his vocals perfectly balancing those of his bride-to-be, Kelis.",0
The lovebirds provide a notable chemistry on another song with lyrical matching to an above-average beat.,0
"Snoop Dogg also spits a classic ode to chronic over a smooth bell-laced beat on"" It Blows My Mind.""",0
"Other noteworthy performances include two cuts by The Clipse on"" Blaze of Glory"" and"" Hot Damn,"" and an odd track by Dirt McGirt ( formerly Old Dirty Bastard of Wu Tang Clan ).",0
"New Star Trak artists Rosco P. Coldchain ( not to be confused with Young Roscoe ) and Fam Lay also put down lyrics and while none of the cuts are skippers, they aren't as solid as those done by the veterans ( Snoop, Nas, Ludacris ).",1
"However, Vanessa Marquez drops impressive vocals on"" Good Girl,"" a cut with a great'80s or early'90s feel.",0
"Hip hop heads may wish to bypass the diversity on"" Clones,"" via the three rock contributions found mid-album.",0
"Also slightly out of place, the Neptunes themselves, in the form of their experimental genre-breaking group N*E*R*D, add an odd track,"" Loser.""",0
The song will be featured on the Madden 2004 video game.,0
"While the beats never fall short, some of the lyricism does.",1
"Nelly proves it's hard to ruin a Neptunes beat on his failed effort"" If,"" a song that borrows it's chorus from a previous Nelly tune.",0
"Similarly, Rosco P. Coldchain misses the mark on"" Hot,"" a song with a minimalist beat that could allow an emcee to truly display his skills.",0
"While The Clipse hold their own on the track, Rosco fails to impress.",0
""" Clones"" would be ill if were released as a pure instrumental album, but the performances of a few of the most seasoned veterans in the game add greatly to the overall appeal of the Neptunes' skillful display of hit making.",0
"With"" Clones,"" the Neptunes certainly secure their spot as one of the most influential and progressive collective minds in music.",0
"They provide a solid foundation of beats from start to finish on"" Clones;"" whether the lyrics hold up to the track is another story.",0
"One thing is for sure: as solid is as a Neptunes beat is, it's difficult for any artist to ruin their genius, despite the content of the lyrics.",0
"When it comes to a killer beat, the nNptunes got it on lock.",0
"The special edition release also includes a DVD with videos"" Frontin,"""" Hot Damn"" and"" Rock N Roll"" and interviews with the Neptunes.",0
"Unfortunately, the disc won't work on my computer's DVD player.",1
Once upon a time there was a rapper named Nas.,0
"He crafted a sheer hip-hop classic, one of the best albums of all time, called Illmatic in 1994.",0
"The album didn't succeed in sales, but dropped the jaws of hip-hop heads nationwide, as they considered Nas the savior and one of the best ever.",1
"In 1996, he followed it up with It Was Written, a more mafiosio album, less riddled with Street Poetry.",0
"On that album, he brought together two of his proteges: AZ and Cormega.",0
"Both of these emcees, along with Nas himself and Foxy would go on to form The Firm, a hip-hop super-group.",0
"However, weeks after its inception, Cormega found himself kicked out the group and replaced with the slightly weaker rapper Nature.",0
Cormega had no choice but to go out on his own.,1
"After a plethora of label problems, he felt it was hopeless, until 2001 when he released The Realness, in my opinion, a modern new-classic album.",0
"If Nas were still his friend, it would make him extremely proud...",0

""" Dramatic Entrance"" is a great opening track, but only food for"" American Beauty"", the first real classic from The Realness.",0
"Taking the age-old extended metaphor formula, started by Common on"" I Used to Love H.E.R."".",0
Cormega uses his extended metaphoric skills to compare hip-hop music to a female.,0
"Cormega sort of tells the story of hip-hop being""abused"" and""raped"" by the industry, specifically sell-out rappers, as he storytells the life of his fe-male, a.k.a.",0
hip-hop.,0
"His lyrics are some of the best of his career, as well as his delivery, as he shows some amazing vocabulary, and a great flow.",0
"The beat, is a soft, synthesized guitar sound, with claps and bass stringed together perfectly.",0
My only complaint is the shortness of the track.,0
""" Thun and Kicko"" features Mobb Deep's own Prodigy, as he and Cormega trade off giving us dark, poetic street tales.",0
"The beat is a soft bass, mixed with a sort of hard banging track, giving it a murderous texture.",0
"Prodigy and Cormega paint themselves like Mobb Deep have constantly on their classics, as street demons and prophets, as well as graphic storytellers and narratives.",0
"They also touch on the street-wise topic of loyalty, which is discussed more thoughroughly on"" R U My N*gga"".",0
"The beat, though saddening and melancholy, is beautifully put together, with a gripping, almost-mafiosio-styled cello snare, with a background whistle, and some perfectly synthesized bass.",0
"This beat would be perfect for a mafia movie, but the lyrics are a bit far-fetched from that.",0
"Cormega goes way back to his childhood, moving up into his teen years, questioning the true factors of loyalty and honor in life.",0
"The perfect beat and amazing lyrics, mixed together with unique and creative subject matter fuel this into being a Cormega Classic.",0
""" Fallen Soldiers"" is a touchy, very creative track where Cormega sort of prays at night time, talking to his very close friends who passed away due to the streets.",0
"The emotional lyrics are as detailed as it gets, giving us storytellings of the particular deaths of his friends, and how it happened.",0
"One interesting lyric pays homage to Killa Black and Ill Will, whom Nas and Mobb Deep constantly grieve.",0
Im guessing that the ties in Queensbridge are very strong.,0
"The beat is melancholy and deep, with a mixture of low-bass and keyboard, and some high synthesizer sounds.",0
"This is an extremely honest track, and he never wastes a lyric on this entire track, which makes it another one of my personal favorites.",1
""" Glory Days"" is yet another saddening look into the mind of Cormega, as he makes himself one of the true masters of street poetry.",0
"On this track, Cormega gives us a flashback of his childhood and youth as we get retrospective storytelling about his childhood, which he loved, yet hated due to his involvement in the streets.",0
"This track is perfect for a nice underground single, and' Mega's lyrics are SO well-written, thoughtful, and descriptive, than i can actually visualize everything he was talking about, and you KNOW if a song makes you do that, its a classic.",0
"The lyrics are a testament to the production, which is a beautiful medley of violins, bass, some guitar, and piano.",0
""" Rap's a Huscle"" is strikingly similar, only on this track, Cormega fast-forwards to more recent events, as Cormega uses his extended metaphor skills once again, comparing hip-hop to huscling and pimping on the streets.",0
"He claims rap music is commited to him, and how much he loves H.E.R.. His metaphors are perfect, and the RandB sounding production is nothing but pure magic to the ears.",0
"Of course, as you may guess, Cormega lays down some verbal attacks towards his enemies on The Realness, namely his former teacher Nasir Jones, aka Nas.",0
"On"" Get out of my Way"" and"" You Don't Want it"", Cormega attacks Nas with his lyrics.",0
"The first of the two is a mix of battle rhymes, and old school braggadiocio, with well-written lyrics and a multi-syllable flow.",0
"The beat features an amazing assortment of classical elements, like violins, trumpets, and hard bass and drums, giving it an epic feel.",0
The second track is much more straight-forward as we actually hear the N-A-S being called out.,0
"Firstly, the track's beat is a sombre, saddening piano beat, with a light, old school drum / snare.",0
"Secondly, Cormega annihilates Nas lyrically.",0
"The complex, multi-syllabalistic, vocabulary, and amazing punchlines and threats.",0
"Cormega gets intelligent, as he makes some very good points about Nas' career and the fact that it is loaded with hypocrisy.",0
""" 5 for 40"" is an accapella freestyle, very well spat and deserving of 4 stars.",0
""" They Forced My Hand"" closes out The Realness ( besides the remix ).",0
"Ironically, this is my favorite song on the entire album.",0
"The beat is epic and loud, with some haunting and beautiful RandB background vocals, a beautiful piano loop, violins, hard bass, and drums.",0
"Cormega solidifies his spot as one of the illest poets and emcees in history, giving us an introspective view of the streets, its darkness, but begs for hope, and thinks it may happen.",0
"No doubt, beautiful.",1
"By fast forwarding the"" Fallen Soldiers Remix"" you get to a hidden track"" Killaz Theme II"", in which Mobb Deep drops by to give us haunting street narratives.",0
"This is a hauntingly evil, yet perfect way to end The Realness.",0
"The Realness could possibly be the best album of 2001, in fact, it is, and one of the greatest of all time.",0
"Its deep street poetry, melancholy and perfect production, and lyrics and it should be purchased by all true hip-hop fans.",0
"Cormega hasn't just left from Nas' shadow, hes basically jumped out like a video game character with this album.",1
Is it the modern day Illmatic?,0
"Possibly, in fact, very likely; Is it a Classic?",0
"Yes, Will it make me dance?",0
F*ck No; Will it make me think?,0
F*ck Yes; Are the beats good?,0
Yes; Should i buy it?,0
VERY Stupid Question....,0
5 Stars,0
"Although Cormega was kicked out of the AZ, Nas, Nature and Foxy Brown group The Firm some time before the groups' debut album, he joined Def Jam records and was working on his own never released debut album The Testament.",1
"Soon after, he was facing jail time on charges unknown to me and never released that album.",1
"Some years later, he's finally released his true debut album, The Realness.",0
"Although I had high expectations for it, it lived up to be everything I had believed it to be and is nothing short of amazing.",1
"Though Nas would say different, Cormega is almost a reincarnate if him.",0
"With this said, its hard not to notice the street poetry, the delivery and multi-syllable flow that s apparent throughout the albums fourteen tracks.",1
"Although many would probably disagree with me, but Cormega's style is, perhaps, better than Nas ever could have thought.",0
"While Illmatic is a classic album of street poetry, The Realness deserves, in every right, to be in that particular hall of fame.",0

Dramatic Entrance is a classic album opener.,0
"Instead of an intro or a skit to level everything out with talking about nothing and various sound effects that make no sense, we get an actual track.",1
"The low-key, very angelic beat is brought to life by a rather complex drum loop and extremely well-fitting harp sound effects and a scaling keyboard effect tops everything off.",0
Without a doubt the beautiful production is only one part of this seemingly ingenious album opener.,1
The actual lyrics are second to none.,1
"Cormega doesn't fuck around with bragging, various comments or just rambling on about nothing, he actually kicks a few verses that touch down on his time before this albums release and how few thought he would actually record this classic album.",1
"The overall effect of hard-hitting lyrics, an on-point flow and suiting production is downright amazing.",0
The one thing I was most surprised at was the fact that he didn't waste any time getting into the actual rhyming and deep subject matter that The Realness undoubtedly has.,0
"The following track, American Beauty, is a rendition of the classic Common track, I Used To Love H.E.R.",0
The overall effect is still the same as' Mega uses the metaphor of a woman for the various uses that Hip-Hop has for both the underground and the mainstream.,0
"Over low-key, relaxing production, his poetic lyrics spill the message into your ear-drums and the whole idea seems fresh again.",0
"His lyrics are second to none and his flow perfectly suits the slow, saddening beat extremely well.",1
"The only problem I have with this particular track is that even though his lyrics are extremely good, the track is too short for him to actually go into any detail that wasn't heard on Common's version.",1
"A few tracks up, we come to my favorite track, bar none on the album.",1
R U My Nigga is a questionnaire of trust and loyalty.,0
"With a beautiful beat provided by Jae-Supreme that consists of a brilliant synthesizer section, a scarce drum loop and a bass kick that tops it all off, Cormega retains his poetic lyrical elements.",0
The subject is brought to brilliant light both by his approach to the subject matter and his street poetry that is included through the track playing off of trust in the streets and his actions that may even warrant distrust.,0
The idea being handled this way is a fresh idea and works considerably well.,0
"To top it all off, listening to valid points over a first-class beat with poetic elements thrown in as well, you can expect a classic track which is exactly what comes from this.",0
"("" The insecurity of things they might never see/Makin' niggas minds corrupt, then my nine erupts/Denyin' what, life you had expired/You tried your luck, then died for what/You asked for forgiveness but my eyes was shut/You wasn't wise enough, to stop me from risin' up/Are you my nigga?"" )",1
"Skipping over the dramatic Unforgiven which seems to recall the events that lead to his incarceration, we come to the heartfelt and emotional Fallen Soldiers.",0
"Over melancholic bass lines and a keyboard effect that is as somber as the bass lines themselves, Cormega reaches into the Heaven's and tries to connect with his deceased friends.",0
"With complex, emotional lyrics that are as simplistic as they can be incredibly deep rhyme-wise, you can never say Cormega isn't emotionally honest.",1
"With each bar he comes off as pained and regretful, as many of us are after we've lost a loved one.",0
"Not only is he incredibly serious and melancholic in tone, his subject matter touched whoever is lucky enough to hear this brilliant track.",1
"Emotionally lyricism is one thing, but crafting a great beat over poetic lyrics that craft more emotion than the production itself is stellar.",0
Without a doubt the introspection here is one of the many stand-outs on The Realness.,1
"The following track, Glory Days, shines because of its original and extremely well-produced beat and it's retrospective, professional lyricism.",0
"After that particular track, we come to another outstanding moment.",0
Rap's A Hustle is an original metaphorical track that uses the idea of pimping for emceeing.,0
' Mega's pen is the prostitute and he is the pimp; this is an extremely original idea in and of itself.,0
It doesn't come as any surprise that the production is stellar.,0
"Over a scarce drum loop, airy sound effects and a keyboard-style background that gets your head nodding immediately, he kicks his original subject matter with no faltering moments.",1
He drops the poetic elements for more Old School-styled lyricism which is slightly simplistic in the rhyme department but just listening to his great use of metaphors is a great listen in and of itself.,0
"As well, over a beat that is near perfect in every aspect makes the track all the much better; without a doubt this extremely fresh view of Hip-Hop is something that more Hip-Hop needs to utilize.",1
You Don't Want It follows later on in the album and is a better example of the battle raps you'll find throughout The Realness.,0
"Much in the same vein as Get Out My Way but lighter in tone,' Mega spews venom and Nas and everyone of his other peers.",0
"Over a piano arrangement and a light drum loop,' Mega drops insult and truthful statements to verbally attack Nas with multi-syllabic rhymes and a scheme that is both complex and on-point flow-wise.",0
"Without a doubt this even outweighs Nas' diss to' Mega, Mobb Deep and Nature with Destroy and Rebuild from Stillmatic simply because he doesn't use typical battle tactics but instead uses the honest truth.",1
This approach is something not many chose to use.,1
"' Mega doesn't resort to immature insults but relies on great lyricism and valid points to explain the situation with Nas, and belittle him.",1
"( You wanna talk violent, but Sig P.'s for solution/ I stalk silent, when I proceed execution/Taught by the, realest niggas to walk the planet/With one thought you vanish, like the Corp. remanded/You on the Ave with your weak mans frontin )",0
The albums ends with the great freestyle 5 For 40 the introspective They Forced My Hand and a classic remix to the already perfect Fallen Soldiers.,0
"Even with the album appearing done, after about two minutes of waiting after the Fallen Soldiers ( Remix ) ends, another track starts up.",0
"An ominous background starts up over a dark bass line, the sound of a record popping and low vocals darken the track all the much more.",0
"Killaz Theme II is and outstanding track, so it comes as a surprise that it s a bonus track and is nt included in the track listing.",1
"Both member of Mobb Deep appear on this track and assist Cormega on dropping some extremely dark, ominous lyrics about the true reality of the streets with a hardcore edge.",0
All three give a great performance with their own distinct flows and subject matter for this particular topic.,0
"Although it s not officially the album closer, the lyrics themselves leave a lasting impression and leave the album on an extremely good note.",1
This is one of the greatest albums of all time; I would even go as far as to say it's the modern day Illmatic.,0
"Out of every one of the fourteen tracks, none of them approach being weak and are all stellar.",1
"Cormega sticks to the streets here and never approaches selling out, which means this is an essential albums for every real Hip-Hop fan.",1
"The outstanding lyricism, great subject matter and fitting production makes this one of the greatest albums you're likely to hear within the category of street poetics.",0
"Find it, buy it, live it.",0

The Hip-Hop world is an ever-evolving place for Columbus producer RJD2.,0
"Two years ago, this guy was doing DJ work in the Columbus area as the lesser-known producer for the MHz.",0
"Today, he's moved to Philly, PA, is busy promoting the hugely acclaimed 8,000,000 Stories with emcee Blueprint ( collectively known as Soul Position ), has recorded what is possibly the single of the year in MF Doom's Saliva, and may even be recording with The Roots for their upcoming The Tipping Point.",0
Let's put it simply and say the man has made a name and a reputation for himself.,0
"A lot of this stems from his glorious solo debut, Deadringer.",0
"While this is an Instrumental Hip-Hop album, trust me, you won't miss the lyrics.",0
"While the album starts with the quirky, dense, mood-setting The Horror it quickly brightens up into a journey through the wonderful world of soul.",0
Smoke and Mirrors shows RJ filling a dark but wondrous track with hard trumpet loops and reflective soul singing samples.,0
Ghostwriter skips the vocals completely and instead goes with a boarderline country guitar sample which bursts joyously into triumphant horns that will leave you breathless.,0
"Being a popular DJ around Ohio's biggest campus ( Ohio State ), RJD2 knows how to have a good time which is exemplified by Good Times Roll Pt. 2. If I had a time machine, I'm pretty sure RJD2 could have sold this track to some Motown artist in the old-soul era.",0
"It's got all the dance, rhythm, and atmosphere of a back-in-the-day party anthem.",0
"To give us a Soul Position preview, Blueprint crashes the party on Final Frontier.",0
"With a wicked piano riff and a little added bounce, RJ sets'Print up for an easy score.",0
"'Print proves he's up to it too, spitting, You're not ill and if you are / My notepads full of medicine / Plus my freestyle is Excederin/ Take two rhymes and call me back with a new style / Be sure you're prepared for the final frontier ( We're here! ).",1
"And indeed, Soul Position has officially arrived on the scene.",0
"While Deadringer is entrenched in soul with a little fun, RJD2 manages to get hard-nosed and a bit reflective.",0
"Chicken-N-Bone Circuit shows his great love of hard drum loops as he forms one of the most chaotic, head-nod-inducing drum beats you will ever hear on wax.",0
"On June he opts for atmosphere instead of the usual steady soul-loops while bringing along MHz emcee, Copywrite.",0
Between Copy's tight intro/retrospective verses RJ digs out a beautiful guitar to drive home the passion of his fellow artist.,0
It's one gripping track.,0
"Nowadays, RJD2 wakes up as an in-demand, financially stable, top 3 producer in Hip-Hop and Deadringer is much to thank for that.",0
"As he continues to ride the verge of complete success, those who know will always point to this album as his major coming out party.",0
"Pick up Deadringer, you won't be disappointed.",1
"Nia, meaning purpose, is one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa.",0
It is defined as making our collective vocation the building of our community to restore our people to their traditional greatness.,0
"This is the principle upon which Blackalicous members Chief Xcel and Gift of Gab built Nia, a masterpiece highlighting the fusion of soul, jazz, poetry, and hip-hop, while still maintaining a dedication to positivity which is lacking in so much of todays music.",0

"The third track"" Do This My Way"" features Lyrics Born of Latyrx, another group on their label, Quannum Projects.",0
"Over a basic drum and bass track, the artists freestyle and free-associate using different pitches, rhythms, and syncopation.",0
Its tight to listen to how many different ways the artists can interact with the track.,0
Lyrics Born raps:,0
""" Id be the first ever Asian astronaut/",0
Blastin off /,0
Castin off /,0
The ties that bind like a smashed guitar/,0
Rode a Mastodon/,0
"Out Jurassic Park /""",0
"The fourth track"" Deception"" tells the fictional tale of an aspiring hip-hop artist whose immediate success causes him to lose perspective, and as a result, leads to his downfall.",0
"To reinforce the theme, the group recites"" Dont let money change you"" as the hook.",0
Xcel and Gift of Gab use a deep bass as the foundation of the song with piano accompanying the bass.,0
Verse two goes:,0
""" His first single was an overnight success hit /",0
Now he went from wearing rags to the best fits /,0
All his new acquaintances /,0
Gassed his head/,0
Takin it /,0
To the point where he lost all his perspective/,0
Started cuttin on the people he came up with /,0
Ego blown like his soul had been abducted /,0
Though his heart was once real/,0
Now material /,0
Has filled /,0
Up his world and he could nt get enough of it /,0
Used to want to be the best of the rap gods /,0
Now his only one concern is going platinum/,0
And his skill has since decreased /,0
And the inner hunger ceased /,0
Now content just as long as fame and cash come/,0
Hes a big Willie now rappin bout cars /,0
"Thousand dollar shopping sprees, hangin out with stars /",0
"I mean, just a year ago he was broke, bumming money,",0
"Drinking out the 40-bottle, living outdoors /""",0
""" A to G"" was obviously designed to display Gift of Gabs lyrical precision.",0
"In this song, a sample is played which announces a letter of the alphabet, from the letter A to G. Then the rapper freestyles several bars using that letter, and manages to make a point and rhyme, despite the limits of alliteration.",0
Its great to listen to a true MC go to work.,0
""" Cliff Hanger"" is a throwback to the days of classic hip-hop, when MCs did nt have to take themselves so seriously.",1
"The song reminds me of Special Eds"" Im on a Mission"" and other songs along that vein, where the rapper takes on the role of a protagonist in some fantasy/espionage/sci-fi tale.",0
"In this one, Gift of Gab becomes"" The Chosen One"", a warrior who was chosen to wield a mystical sword and vanquish evil from some foreign land.",0
The beat is very catchy and the lyrics are so descriptive that the listener can almost see the tale unfold.,0
"In my opinion, poetry has a natural place on a hip-hop album.",0
"Raps lyrical delivery follows poetic form, so the two often work very well together.",0
"Lyricist Lounge Vol. 1, Black Star, and Killah Priest all had great works of poetry on their albums, and Nia does as well.",0
"On Ego Trip by Nikki Giovanni, Blackalicious takes a recitation of Nikki Giovannis poem and sets it over a laid back drum and bass hook.",0
The words flow effortlessly over the beat for a very pleasing effect.,0
"I feel like I could go on forever with this review, so instead Ill trim it back a little.",0
""" Shallow Days"" soulfully relays the message of the need for positivity in hip-hop music and culture.",0
"Poignant observations of life are shown in"" As the World Turns"".",0
"Classic battle raps permeate"" Trouble ( Eve of Destruction )"" All these and many other songs contribute to one of the most original rap albums I have ever heard.",0
"I honestly cannot find anything negative to say about Blackalicious  Nia, except that there should be a lot more albums out there like it.",1
"Give this one a listen, you will not be disappointed.",0
Styles of Beyond is taking the idea of west coast rap and hip hop in general and giving it a 180 degree whirl.,0
"Formed by Los Angeles MCs Ryu and Takbir, this group is one of the most forward moving, futuristic sounding hip hop acts around.",0
"With ample skills from both emcees and backed by some of the most prolific dj's and producers of the underground, their unique take on hip hop is one to pay attention to.",0
"While the duo doesn't undertake anything as pretentious as rapping off and then back on beat or creating an unlisteneable, extremely busy production backing like that of the Def Jux label ( sorry ethompson3, ) the sparse RZA like beats and futuristic lyrical subject matter creates images of flying cars and lunar colonization.",1
"Formed in 1995 at a community college in L.A. where the duo met each other during break, the two formed an instant bond and respect for each others skills.",0
"After working hard in the underground mix show scene, the two released the video game inspired track, Killer Instinct, in 1997 and gained immediate respect and accolades from the underground.",0
"In order to quench the thirst of hip hop fans, they released 2000 Fold in 1998 to a receptive crowd.",0
"Using techno-like, futuristic soundscapes and skilled turntablism, the duo sounded like Jedi Mind Tricks on LSD.",0
"After a long 5 years, SOB released their new album, Megadef, with a parody cover of Metallica's design.",0

On To the Review,0
The Intro is a live track displaying Styles Of Beyond and their collection of scratch tracks.,0
"Nice intro, but ultimately it gets skipped.",0
"The album gets kick started with the title track, Styles of Beyond or Style Warz.",0
"The production is heavily infuenced by RZA with a repetitive, wobbly bass line and some piano keys looped over and over.",0
"However, this is an extremely entertaining track, aided by incredible turntablism and vocal echo samples.",0
The lyrics deal with the ceremonial progression of Styles of Beyond and their pioneering efforts within the underground.,0
"Lyrical imagery is what these two do best, and this track fully emphasizes this concept.",0
"Great track, but better ones up ahead!",0
"With an eerie, piano loop and liquid dripping along with an incredible, drum and bass like bass-line, Hollograms remains my favorite track on the entire album.",0
"Sampling Pharoahe Monch between verses, the duo continue with more futuristic imagery and the two emcees display their lyrical dominance of the mic.",0
"To me, the lyrics are like Canibus' scientific braggadocio aspects but with a blend of imagined millenial forecasting ( if that makes any sense. )",0
Example:,0
"Occupants in my space, bring it on, try to harm me",0
I grab a gun and start to unload like Finnish laundry,0
"Terminology rips, like full clips through {bullsh*t}",0
"Funk flips off the tongue, Ryu's on some pool {sh*t}",0
"Bellyflops and whatnot, low audio sonar",0
Tractor beams pullin all dreams into the polar,0
Symetic solar systematically scramble thoughts,0
"like eggs on Sunday morning, OJ and acid drops",0
"Randomly rippin spots, spittin dope like freebasin'",0
like an open invitation to come and kick it with Satan yo,0
Now thats what I call imagination...,0
Dangerous Minds continues the insane trend of perfection.,0
"With a heavy breathing of a dying creature in the background as well as an eerie flute loop a la Apocalypse Now, the track is set up for some apocalyptic, futuristic lyrics.",0
"The creativity that is displayed is grandiose as usual, tying in some braggadocio with the movie Dangerous Minds, the two emcees rip it:",0
"Actin like a G, but your name ain't Julio",0
Messin with my Dangerous Mind like you was Coolio,0
"Michelle Pfeiffer, I keep it hyper like a sniper",0
"Buckin in plain view, my fangs bare like a viper",0
Step into my cypher son and get tagged,0
around the toe MC RahRah now you John Doe,0
I had to include that one.,0
Spies Like Us is an extremely entertaining concept.,0
"Essentially, the two plot the spying on hip hop, eventually setting their goal as capturing and taking it over.",0
"The track production is not as immediately engaging as previous tracks, but the genius is still there, with incredible wood flutes looping during the choruses.",1
"Overall, this remains one of the best tracks on the album, without the added help of guests or scratching, two of the main strengths of the album as a whole.",1
"Winnetka Exit's resemblance to RZA and his patented, early Wu-Tang hooks is uncanny.",0
"WIth a sparse beat composed of repeating guitars and a vocal sample, the track is minimalist in that RZA kind of way.",0
"A symphonic sample is also included, engaging the listener ever more into the Styles of Beyond world.",0
The two emcee's rep where they are from; the Valley in Los Angeles.,0
"However, the lyrics aren't as incredible as the earlier tracks because of their more straight forward approach.",1
"Some might like it, others, including me, do not like it as much.",1
"After these 5 excellent tracks, the album starts dragging a bit.",0
"Muuvon engages the listener in a""head nodding"" way, although the lyrics are second nature to the beat, which is a mish mash of speedy bass-heavy track-work.",0
"After listening to it for a while, the listener gets sort of a headache.",0
This is one of the few track that the listener can skip.,0
"Besides the decent, loopy production, Easy Back It Up is more lyrical filler about women and live shows.",0
"Nothing misogynistic, but yet, just as dissatisfying.",0
"However, Survival Tactics more than picks up the slack with an excellent track, both lyrically and production wise.",0
"With a surfer guitar strumming and marracas and wood block in the background, the track just screams"" creativity.""",0
"The lyrics are on point, using futuristic war storytelling as a metaphor for their live shows.",0
"Excellent track, once again.",0
Gollaxwelcome takes the space/galaxy concept even further.,0
The two emcee's invite aliens to land on Earth and to display themselves to the world.,0
"While a little bit loony, the production incorporates another futuristic Wu-Tang like loop and some cowbell along with a stuttered bass-line.",0
"The gravelly, lo-fi characteristic of the production lends itself well to the continuity of the album as a whole.",0
"Killer Instinct, their first single, as well as Marco Polo end the album on a positive note, with great production as usual and lyrics that are on point.",0
"This is a classic album, with a bit of dragging in the middle, but nothing to detract from the skill and creativity displayed by both Ryu and Takbir.",0
Hurray for another great album!,0
Totally Devoid of Humor Mental Hospital,0
Official Intake/Evaluation Form,0
Patient Name:Keith Thornton,0
"Aliases:Kool Keith, Dr. Octagon, Black Elvis, Dr. Dooom, Mr. Gerbik",0
"Previous mental health treatment: Treated at Bellvue Mental Hospital briefly, occasional follow-up visits",0
"Employment history: Rapper for hire; previous employment with the underground hip-hop group Ultramagnetic MC's, performing under the name"" Kool Keith"".",0
"Since then, has recorded albums for several labels.",0
"Apparent issues related to identity, having operated under several names and personalities.",0
"Employment record spotty, containing numerous periods of inactivity.",0
"Doctor's Notes: Finding Mr. Thornton deeply distracted and virtually incapable of coherent communication, I have chosen to analyze his artistic work as a manner to perhaps find some insight into his mental health issues.",0
"In commencing upon this effort, I came across his 1996 album Dr. Octagonecologyst, recorded under one of his many aliases, Dr. Octagon.",0
"Upon listening to this album, I found myself deeply disturbed; perhaps this patient may be beyond my medical skills.",0
"As the album begins, I am first disturbed by the first track,"" Intro"".",0
"A conversation between a patient and a doctor, this brief dialogue ( apparently taken from what Mr. Thornton refers to as a""porn flick"" ) demonstrates a disturbing preoccupation with sex, particularly in the highly unethical patient/doctor context.",0
Initial thoughts: maintain distance between females in the facility and Mr. Thornton.,0
Suspicion of hypersexual and/or sexually compulsive behavior.,0
"Particularly of note: the repeated, echoing cries on the track of the female patient exclaiming,""fuck my pussy, doctor!""",0
"Continuing from here, we find Mr. Thornton's delusional behavior coming through, apparently believing himself to be in the year 3000, on the aptly named track"" 3000"".",0
"While his lyrical flow is quite competent, and the assistance of Dan"" The Automator"" Nakamura on production, makes for an overall quality song, it fails to hide his clear case of dementia.",1
"On"" Earth People"", I see that his delusions are even more intense than previously believed.",0
"Keith Thornton is apparently convinced he is, in fact, from Jupiter.",0
He also seems to believe he is actually a doctor.,0
"While he attempts to mask his delusions with clever lyricism and more of Nakamura's production skills, combined with DJ Q-Bert of Northern California's Invisible Scratch Picklz work on the turntables, there is no doubt: Thornton is most assuredly mentally troubled.",1
""" Real Raw"" seems to suggest that Thornton has an inflated sense of self, filled with declarations of his superiority over others.",0
"Additionally, it seems to indicate a perhaps sub-conscious propensity for violence hidden behind his facade.",0
"Evidence of this is further found in the track immediately preceding it,"" No Awareness"", which begins with an excerpt from a movie discussing cannibalism, leading into a song with a decidedly Wu-Tang Clan-like tone to it.",1
"Note to self: make sure orderlies are made aware of subject's potential for violence, and are knowledgeable in the proper use of restraints.",0
""" General Hospital"" appears to be a continuing manifestation of Thornton's delusional belief he is a doctor.",0
"Showing blatant disregard for proper medical behavior, he proclaims a patient dead of chirrosis of the eye, a disease which doesn't even exist.",1
"I am increasingly troubled, curious as to what activities the patient was engaged in prior to treatment.",0
""" Blue Flowers"", outside of the patient's continuing belief he is a practicing surgeon and his description of""green rain"", is unusually cogent, perhaps written during a more lucid period in his disease.",0
It is also accompanied by an impressive bit of musical creativity by the previously mentioned Nakamura and Q-Bert.,0
I am curious as to the mental health of his cohorts working on this album...perhaps I should provide my findings to the appropriate authorities in San Francisco.,0
""" Technical Difficulties"" is the most obvious example present of the""word salad"" typical of most disorganized schizophrenics.",0
With lyrical samples such as:,0
Chewbacca's not here i'ma do it for your circumcised,1
Niggaz don't realize my format is a palm spectrum,1
To damage any rectum,0
This is the real dinosaur funk which permitted g-funk,0
To play anally through the trunk a digital master,0
Was given to sam cooke and jimmy castor,0
It's pretty apparent that the patient is far from mentally stable.,0
"Another sample from one of the patients""porn flicks"", entitled"" A Visit to the Gynecologyst"" contains elements of female impersonation, sexually compulsive behavior, and ( possibly ) rape, I am beginning to question the ability to rehabilitate Mr. Thornton.",0
"Even more disturbingly, on the track"" Halfsharkalligatorhalfman"", Thornton now claims his is Dr. Octagon ( himself )'s 208-year old ancestor, named Mr. Gerbik, a self-described""half-shark, half-man, skin like alligator.",0
"Carrying a dead walrus"".",0
I am now resigned to the fact that this case is going to take a long time.,0
"As the album closes with"" 1977"", the patient's psychosis seems to have intensified, now believing himself to be a house party MC in the late seventies.",0
"Admittedly, Nakamura's production captures the flavor of the song.",0
"However, this only suggests further that Nakamura is clearly complicit in Thornton's delusions, and should be kept away from him if at all possible.",0
"Conclusions: In my studies of Dr. Octagonecologyst, I have been able to clearly conclude that Mr. Thornton has some severe mental issues that may take substantial work to overcome.",0
"Recommend regimen of 125 mg Seroquel daily, with dosages of Ambien as needed.",0
"Also, I highly recommend purchasing the album Dr. Ocatagonecologyst if you are a fan of underground, creative hip-hop music.",0
"Additionally, you will be helping with the treatment of a person clearly in need of mental help.",0
Great Music to Play While: Tripping on acid and playing video games,0
Alcatraz is well known throughout the world as the notorious San Francisco Bay prison built in the 1930s.,0
"In addition to housing such infamous figures like Al Capone and George Machine Gun Kelly, the house of detention is best known for being completely inescapable.",0
"Given the state of artist/label business relationships in rap music, its no wonder that Bay-area rapper Rasco found the federal lockdown facility as a perfect metaphor for rap recording contracts  big names restricted to unfair conditions with little hope of freedom.",1
"Fortunately, Rasco joins an elite minority of rappers able to escape the Rock  with his career still intact.",0
"After tunneling his way out of an unbalanced recording deal with Copasetik Records, the Cali Agent found his way into a more equitable agreement with Coup DEtat that allows to make the music he wants to make with less restrictions.",0
"This year, Rasco celebrates his newfound freedom by dropping his banging new LP, Escape From Alcatraz.",0
The story of Rascos contractual incarceration is told in Snakes In The Grass ( The Jon Sexton Story ).,0
"A combination of street narrative and slick diss track, the emcee recounts the bad situation he was in at his previous record company while sharing some choice words for his former employer.",0
"Its a topic he touches on often on the LP, but dont make the mistake of presupposing Rasco just uses Escape From Alcatraz to lash out at the industry out of self-pity; he manages to cover a variety of other relevant topics as well.",0
"On My Life  Rasco contemplates complex issues such as morality, race, and politics over a bouncy funk-electronica loop.",0
" U Got The Time expresses the artists desire for people to take control of their own destinies, rhyming with conviction over undeniable soul guitars and vocals.",0
"In fact, though the open hostilities toward his former label are liberally peppered throughout Escape From Alcatraz, Rascos music is generally upbeat in nature.",0
"The majority tracks have an infectious jubilant feel, like Ras has just escaped from prison, made it across the border to Mexico, and is throwing one hell of a party to celebrate.",0
"The party mood is captured perfectly in San Fran To The Town  featuring Hieroglyphic Casual tearing up the rich, warm guitar grooves with his cleverly slumpy vocals.",0
"Put Your Hands Up and Real Hot also exemplify the festive vibe with the former a triumphant return to the game over summer anthem-style accompaniment, while Real Hot features an innovative modification of the classic soul sample that Eric B and Rakim made legend with Microphone Fiend. ",0
"Naturally there are a host of celebrities on hand to participate in the revelry, including long-time partner and fellow Cali Agent Planet Asia.",0
"The west coast Wonder Twins activate Endless  with their gruff-voiced Cali big talk, trading sixteen bars of venom over echoing strings, chopped samples, and hefty drums.",0
"Chali 2na of the golden age-reminiscent Jurassic 5 lends his reverberating baritone to The Sweet Science,  the two rap heavyweights unloading a flurry of battle raps spiked with boxing metaphor.",0
"Rascos lyrical footwork here would make even Roy Jones Jr. proud:  I stick jabs in your abs and stay in the lab rhyming / going for feints and bad timing / this be the team that can shatter your spleen/ I go twelve rounds, baby, till your clock is cleaned, knaamean? ",0
"Its mystifying why some record labels would rather let artists spin their wheels doing trendy crap or nothing at all, rather than allow them to make quality albums like Escape From Alcatraz.",0
"Rascos latest effort proves his ability to skillfully craft lyrics that dance between aggression, introspection, and social awareness, while recruiting producers that can adeptly balance his gruff demeanor with rich soul, jazz, and funk-based production.",0
"Rascos situation should prove encouraging for other artists  you may be smashing rocks today, but stay diligent and youll be making smashes tomorrow.",0
At last... My survival in the Epinions community has reached its peak.,0
"Big D has achieved what few have managed, the amazing feat of 150 reviews under his belt.",0
"Im sure its been riveting, and/or boring reading me preach about real hip hop, and doing reviews from AZ to Wu-Tang, to Jay-Z, to Nas, to 2pac, to Eminem, to Gangstarr... ive pretty much touched every single style of hip hop possible.",0
"Ive done reviews on underground hip hop, abstract scientific rap, battle rap, commercial rap, triple-cadence lyricism, political rap, and all of the above.",0
"For my 150th review for Epinions, i had to choose a special album.",0
One that virtually everybody on this network of reviews loves and enjoys.,0
One that is considered a classic by all... what better album can there be than Ras Kass's golden classic Soul On Ice.,0
"In 1996, Hip Hop was a pretty good, yet bad state.",0
"Within the flames of the horrid east-coast / west-coast rivalry, tons of classics were released on this magical year of 1996.",0
"Albums by Jay-Z, Gangstarr, Mobb Deep, and 2pac fueled our thirsts for hip hop, but both coasts were not only split by rivalry, but split by style.",1
"The east coast of hip hop relied more on complex lyricism and social consciousness, shown by such emcees as Nas, The Wu-Tang Clan, Jay-Z, Mobb Deep, Biggie, and many more...",0
"However, the west seemed more jiggy and gangsta, fueled by the emergence of Death Row Records and Gangsta Rap.",0
"Emcees like Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Kurupt, and 2pac were giving us the G-Funk style of hip hop.",0
"However, it seemed difficult to find any true competent advanced lyricists in the west.",0
"With the exception of a cadre of underground lyricists and Kurupt, there were no really good lyrical masterminds from the west.",1
Along comes Ras Kass.,0
There was so much buzz surrounding the underground west coast hip hop scene in 1993 over this man that it is ridiculous.,0
Ras Kass was known for his freestyles and b-sides he would release in the underground.,0
"At one point, he caught the eye of a record executive who listened to his Soul on Ice EP, and immediately signed Ras for a deal.",0
"It took a little under a year for Ras Kass to complete his first major label debut, entitled Soul on Ice, which was released in 1994.",0
"Ras Kass was on top of the world, until this album was pulled from stores for its extremely graphic, somewhat racial, and controversial lyrics.",0
"Unfortunately, it was put out of print and very few real copies were left avaliable on the planet.",0
"Unfortunately, many have not heard this album, and those who have can consider themselves lucky, because Soul on Ice could arguably be the most lyrical album in hip hop music... hands down.",1

"If you dont think that this is the most lyrical album, it definetely gets the trophy for most metaphor used within an album.",0

His unorthodox skills on the microphone guarantees that your jaw will drop listening to the lyrics more than once on this track.,0
"Its clear that Ras does his research before writing a track without having to resort to reading"" Jiggyness 101"" and"" Sell-Out 101"".",1
The hip-hop martyr who sacrificed and gave my life,0

""" Anything Goes"" is our first showcase of Ras Kass' street poetry.",0
Ras gives us some tight verses about getting ahead of life.,0
"He claims that everybody on the planet will do anything to get money, which sort of mocks a lot of people, including commercial rappers who sell-out for money.",0
Ras Kass' metaphors and insertions of battle rhymes complement the track perfectly.,0
"Ras sort of admits to following the mentality of taking the easy, yet cheap, way through life, but mocks those who do it because he has gotten more advanced in his mind than he was at that time.",0
"The production is well produced, featuring some harmonicly deep basslines, drum / clap loop, low-keyboard violins, and some background vocals, which fit with the dark mood of the song and the lyrics.",0
Another masterpiece.,0
""" Marinatin' is next on Soul on Ice.",0
"The instrumental is a slow-paced, jazzy sounding track with some flutes, snares, some synthesized keyboards, a triangle, drum loops and a low bassline.",0
"Ras Kass takes the west coast mentality of G-Funk and inserts it into the track, rapping a slow song about a party, Ras Kass' style.",0
"However, do not get this mistaken with commercialism, because this is not the case.",1
"Ras Kass vividly describes living the good life, very vividly, and separates himself from the other west coast rappers with his use of metaphors, clever wordplay, similes, and utilyzes a more in-tune multi-syllable flow for the third verse.",0
"Ras continues the jazzy tunes with"" Reelyishm"".",0
"Ras Kass drops social commentary of himself, comparing himself to the current state of hip hop music, stating that he doesn't care about selling records as long as he keeps it real and true to the underground.",1
"On the second verse, his lyricism improves using a more advanced scientific vocabulary and a multi-syllable flow.",0
"Ras raps about the streets at times, giving it a more street poetry feel.",0
"The production is very simplistic, but fits the mood.",0

Like the coronal suture...,0
So I write truly fat sh*t for the core audience,0
But sometimes I wonder does it really exist?,0
Cuz true lyricists in hip-hop Joe Public be dissin,0
"N*ggas don't relate, elevate and its treated like elevator music",0
"At last, we get to defining moment of Ras Kass career, and of Soul On Ice, possibly the single most controversial track in hip hop:"" Nature of the Threat"".",0
"To summarize it as best i can, Ras Kass time travels back to the birth of humankind in itself, tracing the history all the way back to present day.",0
Ras Kass gives us a plethora of narratives covering the oppression of caucasian individuals / white people towards african american individuals and basically the entire world.,0
"Ras Kass raps about nearly all of the mistakes in the past, striking out with tons of a bunch of claims about changing the entire history of Jesus Christ, the Roman Age, the birth of the Smallpox / Aids Viruses, and the myth about Thanksgiving.",0
This lone track has become a pure legend among hip hop heads worldwide.,0
"Ras raps on this track, telling the entire story for nearly 8 minutes straight.",0
"He mentions so many historical figures, too many to count on this particular review.",0
"Ras Kass' research for this track took months, and his effort is extremely appreciate, even though some of the information is a bit off and wrong, but either way he makes you want to go to your local Public Library and actually research these facts yourself, that is how much of an impact this song has.",0
"When it comes to the basic hip hop elements, Ras is on point with top-notch lyricism, metaphors, similes, clever wordplay, and a shining delivery.",0
"The production is deep and dark, driven by a recurring bassline, low-drums, and church bells in the background.",0
"This is a nominee for greatest hip hop track ever recorded, and if you're looking for a lyrical sample.. sorry... try ohhla.com,",0
"if not... then buy the album, which is what you should've done a long time ago.",1
"""Etc"" is next.",0
"On here, Ras switches up a bit.",0
"Ras speeds up his flow, almost reaching a triple-cadence style, but slows down at times.",0
Ras uses amazing lyricism to take down all the commercial rappers and materialistic emcees in this venomous battle rap.,0
"Ras is extremely clever and loves to use wordplay on this track, for a partion of the track, Ras uses some amazing alliteration, starting almost every word out with the letter"" R"".",0
"His metaphors are of pure genius at times, and he gives us a new one every two or three bars... amazing.",0
"The production is more funky, with some vocal samples, scratching, synthesized bassline, flutes, and drum / snare mix.",0

"Ras Kass gives us a track dedicated to the lost hip hop coast of the West, with"" Sonset"".",0
"Ras stands up for the west coast on this track, displaying his lyrical skill and exploratory flow, which is amazingly good.",0
Ras Kass sort of declares war on the entire east coast simply for thinking that they had superiority over the west.,0
"Ras Kass mocks their superiority complex, which sort of angered Ras.",0
"I'm very sure that this not to fuel the fire between the coasts and the Biggie / Pac wars, but is simply standing up for his coast.",1

Definetely a masterful track.,0
Nappy headed n*gga stigmatism at birth,0
Born to a family of four and so that makes me one-fourth,0
of a dysfunctional home...,0
I had a father who only stayed to see me grown,0
When I turned twelve he was gone,0
"Alone, no role model",1
I used to watch my Granddaddy and Uncle hit the bottle,0
and then hit each other,0
"Granddaddy beat Grandmother, but that's before my time",0
but I still see how it affected her mind,0
"As a child I introverted, and drew pictures",0
While my mother prayed to Jesus reading King James scriptures,0

Fools lay claim to fly rhymes but I terrorize airlines,0
My mind's a porcelain Glock 7 slippin' through the metal detectors,0
Ready to wet'cha like baptism,0
It's rap pugilism when I be placin' 208 bones in one zone;,0
"With microphones, I'm like the Blade Runner hunting clones",0
"I"" Beat It"" like one glove and a bad nose job",0
With more breathin techniques than Lamaze,0
Ras still be drinkin' malt liquor brews,0
And continues the liquidation of crews,0
Wit' a drunken technique like Shun Di's kung fu on Virtua Fighter 2,0
""" Miami Life"" is the only single that i am aware of that was released from Soul on Ice.",0

"Ras Kass raps about basically"" Miami Life"", as he gives props to his life in Miami, and the life-style in Miami.",0

The metaphors and similes in this track are too high to count and is yet another lyrical wonder.,0
"The beat features some sombre synthesized flutes, drum / bass, and some background siren noises.",0
"Nothing too special, but really good and complementary to Ras skill.",0
"The title track"" Soul on Ice"" is next.",0
"This is actually a remix of the original, done by Diamond D, who provides a new beat.",0
"However, ive never heard the original, so i cant judge the original, but i can say that this beat is nice.",1
"It has some chimes, synthesized pianos, and a drum / clap mix.",0
"Ras Kass raps in a very"" Public Enemy"" style, rapping about everything from the problem to the world, to mixing it up with battle raps against commercial rappers, sort of taking the mentality from where the song originated.",0
""" Soul on Ice"" was originally a book written by former Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver, where he wrote about african americans living in America, loaded with problems (avaliable on Epinions ).",0
Ras touches on those topics and sort of does a re-interepretation of the book.,0
Yet another classic.,0
"The final track on the legendary Soul on Ice is the aptly titled"" Ordo Abchao ( Order Out Of Chaos )"".",0
"The introduction to the song is a thumping and haunting drum beat, until a horn, piano keys, chimes, hard bass, and some background vocals, which provide the backdrop for the rest of the track.",0
"Ras Kass comes on the mic with yet another classic as he points out a handful of conspiracy theories, government cover-ups, mixed in with social consciousness about how its basically towards blacks.",0
"Ras Kass raps about the anger and hatred towards blacks for no reason, and how even the government is trying to control us with diseases.",1
The subject matter is amazing and will keep your ears open.,0
"Sort of a sequel to"" Nature of the Threat"", which provides a perfect close to the album.",0
"Now sh*t gets no realer, reality dictates fate",1
"Gobal Policy 2000 by then, the planet depopulates",0
By about 1 billion men women and children,0
By whatever means necessary,0
"Wars, diseases, starvation, plagues etc.",0
Set ya watch and watch Lord Matreya ascend,0
Been in effect since before George Washington Monument,0
Soul On Ice has stamped itself as being one of the candidates for being the Greatest Hip Hop Album in the History of Music.,0
"Ras Kass provides lyrical classic, after classic, after classic and sometimes i feel that he is the greatest lyricist of all time.",0
"However, he sort of killed that notion when he released the extremely mediocre Rassassination.",0
"Amazing Wordplay, mixed with intelligent vocabulary, controversy, metaphors, similes, confidence, storytelling, narratives, and a socially conscious eye, and you've got Soul On Ice.",0
This is one of the most highly reccomended albums i could reccomend... to everybody.,0
Soul On Ice is a CD which will forever be declared royalty within the annals of time...,0
5 Stars... Pure Classic,0
"Usually when a hip hop group is forced to re-assemble after a dismantling of the original group, the results are less than favorable.",0
Not so with the Arsonists.,1
"Going from a sprawling group of five original members, to a smaller three, actually helps the flow and makes the album a much more consistent showing.",0
"The original Arsonists release titled"" As The World Burns"" was essentially a mish-mash of old material recorded since 1993 up to 1999 and the variance in production and skill throughout that time period is overwhelming.",0
"The original five was cut to just three, Jise, Q-Unique, and Swel 79.",0
"These three MC's released the album"" Date of Birth"", a much more thorough and unique listen than the original.",0
"Lyrically, the three play off of each other very well, seemingly finding a perfect fit.",0
"Usually an intro on modern hip hop records is purely there for album filler, but even this trend is torched by the Arsonists.",0
""" Date of Birth"" summarizes the new Arsonist sound and keeps the listener updated on the trials and tribulations of the crew.",0
Introducing all three MC's style it makes for a moving foray.,0
""" Stay Lo"", the second track on the album is a total destruction of mainstream rap and the platinum status achieved by many such artists.",0
""" A million sold don't make you pro"" Jise alerts.",0
"The beat is pretty standard affair and it takes a backseat to the lyrics, as it should.",0
"The next two tracks are just as good as the second one, continuing to scorch mainstream rap and moving towards a hip hop nirvana.",0
Nirvana is reached on,0
""" Language Arts"" an absolutely incredible track.",0
Using traditional Japanese kabuki theater strings with a deep bass beat along with some scratching.,0
The lyrics surprisingly are not the main focus because the production is so truly innovative.,0
Its something you must witness to believe.,0
"The next truly grandiose track is"" Alive"" another amazing production track with great lyrics.",0
"Nothing on the album reaches the perfection achieved by"" Language Arts"" or"" Alive"", but the overall album is up there among the best underground releases of 2001.",0
I would recommend this release to anyone who likes to hear more than just the typical gangsta bling bling  mentality.,0
"Sad to think that this group will always remain beneath mainstream radar, never reaching more than a cult status, but then again, isn't that the point?",1
"Zion I: Zion ( rhymes ), Amp Live ( beats ), DJ K-Genius (scratches )",0
Production: Amp Live,0
1. Creation - Intro,0
2. Revolution (B-Boy Anthem - Zion I's first song is an infectious blend of Asian-sounding backgrounds and futuristic Southern bounce.,0
"This isn't the best of his rhyming abilities, but that doesn't matter too much because this is supposed to be an anthem.",1
"They did their job right, because it really sounds like one.",0
3. Critical feat.,0
"Planet Asia - If DJ Premier's descendants from the year 3000 made beats, they would probably sound like this.",0
Zion and Planet Asia from the Cali Agents flow really well over this.,0
4. Mysterious Wayz - Now we get a middle-eastern futuristic beat.,0
Zion tells a cool story about meeting an Arabic woman.,0
The production and the rhymes are perfect together.,0
5. The Choice - Skit,0
"The Koncrete Jungle - Another choppy, futuristic beat from Amp Live.",0
"My description of this album might make it seem a little monotonous, but believe me it's not.",1
"It's just that the only word I can think of to describe it is""futuristic.""",0
7. Metropolis - This is just an instrumental track from Amp Live.,0
"But it's a full-fledged drum and bass track, not hip-hop.",1
This is a DOPE track.,0
8. Oh Lawd - Skit,0
9. Trippin - DAMN this beat is good.,0
Zion continues to flow nicely over these beats.,0
This is probably the best song so far.,0
"10. How Many - Like all the other songs, Zion strives to be creative and not just resort to any old subject matter.",1
He asks the listener a bunch of questions over this song.,0
"Once again, Amp Live comes through with the beats.",0
-4.5,0
11. Elevaton - This song has Zion I's collective creativity peaking.,0
This song sounds nothing like any hip-hop you've ever heard before.,1
"The beat is pretty much drum and bass, but this time Zion tries out a new flow.",0
"Instead of racing to keep up with the pace of the beat, he rhymes in a sedated, half-time flow that makes the chilled-out vibe of the production even better.",0
12. A Little Change - A little disappointing after the previous song.,0
This isn't up to par with the rest of the album so far.,1
"It has a pretty unique beat, though.",0
-3.5,0
13. Fools Gold - Skit,0
"14. Venus - This is a song about commercialized hip-hop using a woman as a metaphor, in the same boat as Common's I Used to Love H.E.R. Sometimes she shake her thang, sometimes she want to chill / But otherwise she searching for that doggone dollar bill / Yo, she settin up the kill from the moment that it starts / Prayin on the weakness that be lurking in they hearts. ",0
-4.5,0
"15. Rap Degreez - Some more futuristic production, this time with an Indian and Wu-Tang influence ( plenty of kung-fu vocal samples ).",0
This is also one of Zion's best moments as an MC. - 5,0
16. Silly Puddy feat.,0
"The Grouch - A couple of my friends think this beat is too spaced out, but I think it's incredible.",0
"Underground hero the Grouch makes a nice guest appearance, and Zion comes very tight with his rhymes.",0
17. Inner Light - The first single from the album is a classic.,0
"This one is very similar to Elevation, where Zion has a laid-back delivery over relaxed, but fast-paced drum and bass production.",0
18. Big Ups - Skit,0
All Tha Way feat.,0
"Knowmatic, Rasco, and 427 - The other half of the Cali Agents, Rasco, two MC's I've never heard of, and Zion all rip into this nice beat.",1
"A great posse cut, I just wish I knew who half the posse was.",0
-4.5,0
"One - Zion I was formed in Atlanta ( although they are California-based ), and the Outkast influence seeps through in this track, namely the sound from their sophomore album ATLiens.",0
"That happens to be a classic hip-hop album, and a personal favorite of mine, so naturally I LOVE this track.",0
"21. Inner Light ( Icey Remix ) ( Bonus Track ) - A lot of the time, bonus tracks would really be more appropriately titled"" Throw-away Tracks.""",0
"Fortunately for us, this remix is even better than the original.",0
""" Life is one big road, with lots of signs / Let your inner light shine / Let your inner light shine..."" - 5",0
Songs - 4.75,0
Beats - 5,0
Rhymes - 4.5,0
Originality - 5,0
Overall - 4.75 / 5,0
"Simply because they aren't on a huge label or have their videos on MTV, Zion I is criminally slept on.",1
The best thing about this CD is it's wide appeal.,0
"I already compared Zion I to Outkast on one song, but they deserve another comparison: both groups have a universal sound that can appeal to both the average listener who simply turns on the radio to hear music, but by the same token both have more than enough artistic merit to please even the most picky, critical backpacker who listens to music simply because other people don't know about it.",1
The big difference is EXPOSURE.,0
"I guarantee Zion I would sell millions of records if the video they made for Revolution (B-Boy Anthem ) (yes, they have a video for it ) was given rotation on MTV, or if Trippin, One, or Inner Light were played on major radio stations.",0
But enough about their potential.,0
Now I'll talk about the actual reasons of why they're good.,0
"First off, we have the beats.",0
"Amp Live turns in an extremely impressive performance on this album, putting his own personal spins on hip-hop and drum and bass.",0
"I've never heard production like this before, but I sure as hell wish I had.",1
"Next, the MCing.",0
"Zion isn't the most complex MC you'll ever hear, but every song he writes has a message.",1
"And although the beats could probably stand without Zion and be rhymed on by anyone, Zion and Amp Live REALLY have chemistry together.",0
"I'll use Gangstarr as an example: DJ Premier can produce for anyone, and Guru can flow over anyone's beats, but they always sound better together.",0
Same thing for Amp Live and Zion.,0
"This album is a near-classic, my favorite overall album from 2000, and one of the most unique albums I've ever heard.",0
Buy it immediately if not sooner.,1
"Zion I is a group of 3 men: MC Zion, producer Amp Live, and DJ K-Genius.",0
Their futuristic sound is one I have yet to hear reproduced.,0
They originate from Atlanta and have since moved to Oakland.,0
"They combine hip-hop, drum n' bass, techno, and god-knows-what to create a musical soundscape unparalleled in maybe all of music.",0
""" Mind Over Matter"" starts with"" Creation"" which is, simply, a sampled reading of The Bible's Genesis that describes God's creation of light.",0
"I'm an athiest, so this immediately had me questionable, but this should not stop anyone from continuing with the album.",1
""" Revolution"" is the first single off of the album.",0
An incredible club-banger that has MC Zion dropping pure hiphop lyrics that talk about everything there is while still making it a party track.,0
The production is revolutionary.,0
"Scratching, violin sounds, a chopped bassline.",0
Listing them cannot convey the way that they merge so beautifully on this track.,1
""" I'm a b-boy, that's all that I am/step into the party with a fireproof plan/ I'm a b-boy, that's all that it is/step into the party, got up with the pyramids.""",0
I usually prefer high-vocabulary strewn lyrics but this music is hip-hop as its very purest.,0
Oldschool and futuristic simultaneously.,0
"The next song,"" Critical"" has lyrical mad-man Planet Asia trading verses about the mission of the emcee over a beat that sounds like the whole song is a sample, the way it thumps and repeats and stops.",0
"To quote Planet Asia,"" My brother hit me on the game/Said that we original man/And we manifested here to spit slang/ I thought a minute, and let it sink /Deep like the Titanic /We wider than the ocean of Atlantic/Pacifical mythical styles / In the west it's gettin' wild/ I'm chillin' like the Sphinx upon the Nile/",0
Reverberating/ Why is you hatin' hip hop we creatin?/Across the desert sands we be bakin'/My melanin/The key to lock rock spots and flocks /Walk the rugged avenue with my B-Boy bop/It's evolution toss a pebble at the devil and smile/,0
"I'm rebellion while propelling freestyles"" Sure, it seems haphazard at first, but you need to understand the state of mind these emcees are entering to comprehend.",0
""" Mysterious Wayz"" has MC Zion telling of a love story with a mid-eastern Asian woman that hypnotizes him with her exotic flair.",0
"The beat seems to come straight out of that region of the world, with flutes and the sound of what must be some kind of magic dust being dropped.",0
??? Hard to describe.,0
""" She's from a land of sand/where pyramids dwell/and angels blow their breath through sea shells/Like Isis, Oshun, and Ausset/Mysterious lady that I can't forget.""",1
Mystic words from a man that seems to seperate from his confining human form when rhyming.,0
But this supernatural vibe doesn't last forever as the truth of reality strikes us.,0
""" Tha Choice"" is a spoken word piece by a poet that, after waking up after the time with the mysterious lady, speaks of the horrible life in an urban setting.",0
Sounds from the city whisper in the background until...,0
"With a harsh thumping syncopation, MC Zion starts the next track"" Koncrete Jungle,"" telling of this same pain.",0
The track is pretty much about how he hates the city and such an existence.,0
""" Dark streets/swoll feet/where massive trash heeps/You speak/Most weep/SORROW/runs deep/Pain/Escape through cocaine..."" he goes on in a staccato tempo that freakishly embodies the city's moral horrors.",0
I'm from NYC and this song always hits me when I hear it.,0
"The city theme continues as the musical geniuses sample Mos Def's lines"" Metropolis... Who on top of this"" over a long-running instrumental DJ-capade of city-sorrow.",0
"Techno-paced snaps and crackles convey the pace of life in the Metropolis, building on the two tracks before.",0
""" Trippin'"", what many consider the best track on the album, has a tint of that southern influence with a beat that is... intergalactic.",0
I can't find another word.,0
"MC Zion tells of the pains of living in itself, the world and its self-inflicted crimes.",0
""" Seem like everybody trippin/Or is it me?/Being normal nowadays, It'll drive you cra-zy/Go to work 9 to 5 everyday, no retreat/You got to have a dollar",0
Just to get somethin' to eat/It seem like everybody trippin',0
Or is it I? / Crazy lady walkin around.,0
"Shoutin curses at the sky/Instrumentals be the lullaby/Rhyme stimuli, / now come along, And vibe as we praise most high/You be trippin'/",0
"Why is you trippin, why is you trippin'? /""",0
"Yes, it has the religious tint to it, but it does not, in any way, take away from the track.",0
""" How Many"" has the topic of before revisited in a more poetic way with lucious piano keys being stroked for the beat and the occasional organic guitar whine.",0
"MC Zion poses so many of life's questions in the form of""how many?"" Truly beautiful song.",0
""" Elevation"" is one of the more techno influenced tracks with a repitive beat that can send you to sleep, but in a good way.",0
MC Zion talks of days of before and days in the future.,0
"Again, the content is incredible.",0
Anyone who believes that hiphop has no morals deserves to be proved wrong.,1
Use this track against them!,0
And then the moral anger of Zion I is unleashed.,0
The topic of $ /$ is tackled from so many angles.,0
""" A Little Cash"" samples Brooklyn respectable emcee AZ as MC Zion asks for"" a little change.""",0
"He means it in both ways, ironically.",0
The intelligence is on another level.,0
"This topic continues with"" Fools Gold"" where the DJs sample rappers talking about money... from Rakim's"" Paid In Full"" to Jay-Z's"" Money Ain't A Thing.""",0
And then sex.,0
See the pattern?,0
"Violence, Money, and now Sex.",0
"MC Zion talks about"" Venus,"" that Greek goddess of love and criticizes her wiley ways, greed, and the way she treats everyone, as well as how she has been treated.",0
"A great extended-metaphor, a conceit, creates this track.",0
"Original, indeed.",0
"The criticisms are pretty much done, and now"" Rap Degreez.""",0
"MC Zion is pretty much doing that"" I am MC"" thing, talking about the powers of the MC, bragadaccio rhymes, mystic powers, etc. and pulls it off without seeming cocky.",1
And the beat is...OFF THE HOOK.,0
"I think they sample the music from the lava level from Nintendo 64's"" Mario 64"" for the beat.",0
""" Silly Puddy"", with super-introspective emcee The Grouch talks about the human being and how we are influenced by everything.",0
"Our flaws and abilities, and our nature as a whole.",0
"As The Grouch says,"" No one to claim Creator yet the masses are perplexed/Cause by life we're so impressed, we all wish we had a next.""",0
"The beat is space-age satellite influenced, as you can tell, and the two emcees' contrasting flows fit perfectly over the beat.",0
""" Inner Light"" is as positive as you can get about us.",0
"It covers humans again, but our possibilities and good aspects.",0
This second single has a magnificent violin and flute and god knows what else.,0
A true masterpiece of music.,0
What does this album NOT cover?? Definitely one of the best tacks,1
"Then there's"" All Tha Way,"" a blazing battle track similar to"" Twince inna lifetime"" from Blackstar's album the way it's set up, featuring Eclipse 427 and Rasco.",0
"Then"" One"" ends the album on a techno beat once more, as Zion I closes this book with an appropriate epilogue.",0
"Best Tracks: Inner Light, Mysterious Wayz, Revolution, Rap Degreez",0
Worst Tracks: Big Ups,0
"Coming out of the streets of New York city, through Chicago, as a former member of the Mental Giants crew, and hot off the success of the lead single on the LP,"" Hot Ya Hot"", Akbar has released his debut full length on Ill Boogie Records, the imprint of production/DJ guru M-Boogie.",0
"Akbar means"" the greatest"" in Arabic, so right off, this kid had better have skills, because it's obvious he has cockiness in spades.",0
"In terms of vocal style, Ak sounds pretty generic, and a lot like any of the hundreds of MC's that have tried to ply their craft coming out of NY.",0
This con is countered however by the fact that Ak can DEFINITELY flow for days.,0
"He's got a very smooth delivery, nice punchlines, and he's able to paint a vivid mental picture when necessary.",0
So does it work?,0
"There's a lot of MC's with skills in the game today ( see Canibus ) that have failed because of beats, so success isn't a given for Ak, even though he has the skills.",1
Let's check it out.,0
1)Hip Hop Is...,0
"As the title would suggest, a basic track giving a breakdown on what Akbar thinks hip hop is.",0
"A DOPE beat here provided by Jun, which features a rolling piano loop, and could have been done by Premier, it's executed so slickly.",0
"Some nice cuts provided by Fredones, and the lyrics are on point too, with Ak using a laidback, Nas-like flow to give his thoughts on hip hop.",0
A great opener.,0
""" Hip hop is",0
A style that's wild,0
A ghetto child looking for a reason to smile,0
Hip hop is,0
The application of street knowledge,0
"For modern day situations not learned in college""",0
2) No Suckas Allowed,0
"Some ill cuts intro the track here, as M-Boogie makes his first production appearance on the LP.",0
"He provides a moderately paced beat with a funky bass line, and some nice 70's sounding organ synths, with scratches interspersed throughout the beat.",0
"Ak decides to take on wack MC's on this track, spitting some serious venom in their direction.",0
"His voice may be a bit generic, but he is REALLY good with his flow... I mean SERIOUSLY good.",0
"Amazingly, as verbose as the track is, I think it would REALLY rock a party hard.",0
""" When ya came in the party and you saw the crowd",0
"Shoulda read the sign,",0
""" No suckas allowed""",0
This jam is for the real rappin fans,0
Put the stomp in your feet and the clap in your hands,0
"The nod in your head, and the hump in your back",0
With the uncontrollable urge to jump in the track,0
You know I'm bout to come up with something phat,0
"When I take control, can't nothing hold me back""",0
3)Bigga Dey Come,0
"After some silence, a couple of bells enter the picture, and the mood changes up quite a bit from the party vibe of the previous track.",0
"A darker bassline underlines the bells, and some basic drums accompany it.",0
"This is on some more basic NY ish here, and reminds me of something Mobb Deep would maybe rock over.",0
A nice touch is that you can hear the record crackliness and pops.,0
Call me a sucker for analog.,0
"Befitting the production, Ak goes a little deeper with the lyrics here in the first verse, concentrating on his life, and whether or not others would remember him if he was gone, and if they did, what they would think.",1
The second verse focuses on a lot of the supposed conspiracies in the world today ( ie.,0
drugs provided by the government ).,0
A dope track that shows yet another side of Ak.,0
""" How can I hide from the genocide?",0
Job provides ultimate route to get me out,0
And escape,0
Babylon fate no doubt,0
"There's only one righteous path, you do the math",0
While you hold your breath waiting on the year 2000,0
The government's busy taking your public housing,0
"Wages kept minimum, it's new millenium",0
"Replace your ghetto with condominiums""",0
4) Take It There,0
"A nice piano loop once again, highlighted by a dope horn sample at the end of it makes up the beat here.",0
After a few seconds a nice bassline comes in and serves as perfect compliment to the samples.,0
"The lyrics deal with Akbar's formative years came about, as he narrates his early life, and his multiple moves from NY to California to Chicago.",0
A nice touch is the use of some old school loops interspersed for added effect during the song.,0
"Halfway through the song, some weirdish flute noises jump in too.",0
"A very busy beat, but it works.",0
"The lyrics as usual are top notch, and Ak has served notice 4 tracks in, at least to me, that he's a HUGE force to be reckoned with in the world of hip hop today.",0
""" Took us west, straight through the country",0
"To California, is the place to see",0
"So daddy put us inside, his Cadillac",0
"We hit the west coast, I thought we'd never come back",0
"Now, I'm walking on green grass",0
3 years went past,0
"Palm trees, ocean breeze, where the summers last",0
"See, that's the life that I led",0
"It taught me home is just the place where you lay your head""",0
5)5th Element,0
"Some nice drums kick things off, with a jazzy piano line, and some nice cuts in the background.",0
"Pretty sparse after that, as Ak goes to a more minimal beat here, provided by DJ Revolution, of"" Wake Up Show"" fame.",0
"Much like"" No Suckas Allowed"", this is basically another braggadacio track, with Akbar letting all know how dope he is.",0
"Some nice one liners in there, and as you'd expect from a Revolution production some ill cuts, fades, and scratches.",0
6)Driftin Thru Space,0
Time for a slow joint?,0
Sounds like it.,0
"Some spacey sounds, and some sitar-like sounds accentuate this darker track, as Akbar switches up his lyrics yet again, this time focusing on the creation of the universe, and Allah's part in it.",0
"It's been done before countless times, but Ak manages to make it sound fresh.",0
""" The land was divided by oceans and great seas",0
With rivers that ran like the Nile and Euphrates,0
"And fish swam, and birds flew through the sky",0
And animals roamed the plain,0
And they too multiplied,0
As each and every living thing began to sing,0
Giving praise to the king for bringing life and love and peace and harmony,0
Was manifest,0
"Cuz the sun was set in the west""",0
7)Akbar Speaks( Interlude ),0
"As you'd guess, Akbar speaking on a number of things, including health, and mental stuff.",0
"Interesting, but DEFINITELY skippable to the max.",0
The liners say this was recorded from a radio show.,0
8) Those Who Say,0
"This Kid Named Miles from critically acclaimed crew Breakestra produces this track, and to tell the truth, I'm a bit underwhelmed.",0
"There are some nice dirty sounding hard hitting drums here, and a decent enough bassline, but apart from a couple of horn samples interspersed, it's kind of boring, and well, average.",0
"The lyrics are above average here again though, and end up saving the track, as Ak once again goes the braggadacio route.",0
""" I'm not a gangsta",0
I'm something closer to a monster,0
"Chi-Town, underground, Boogie Down, Bronxer",0
Remember when I stomped ya?,0
Live in concert?,0
"With the rugged raw, I came, saw, and conquered""",0
9) Hot Ya Hot(M-Boogie Remix ),0
Bliss.,0
"If there's one word to describe this track, that would be it.",0
"DJ Revolution provides some disgustingly good scratches, and M-Boogie laces this beat in his usual style( think DJ Premier ).",0
"Ak once again comes correct on vocals, letting MC's know that the only way they'll succeed is if they drop the hot ish.",0
""" A shot from a 4-5 couldn't stop my vibe",0
"Phase me and daze me, nobody plays me",0
"They all shot at me, they gotta be crazy!",0
"They only grazed me, I had to be swayzee",0
"My momma always told me not to be lazy""",0
10)Mothaship,0
A crazy nice beat provided here by DJ Shame.,0
"A beautiful vocal sample that sounds almost mournful laces the background, with some basic drums serving as the backdrop.",0
Very simple.,0
The subject matter?,0
A UFO sighting and some of Akbar's thoughts on extraterrestrial life.,0
""" I was smack dab in the middle of a wonderful dream",0
When I was suddenly awoken by a frightening scream,0
My first reaction was to grab my heat,0
"Pull down the covers, threw back the sheets",0
"Looked over to the window, sprang to my feet",0
"Outside, I saw mad people on the street",0
In a state of shock,0
"Somebody called the cops, to quiet the riot",0
But now they pulling out Glocks,0
"Shutting down blocks, busting shots at the sky",0
But why even try to defy the most high?,0
"It was a divine sign, encounter of the third kind""",0
11 ) Space Odyssey,0
"A dreamlike sample runs this track, and sounds pulled from something like Mary Poppins.",0
"An inventive use of the sample, no doubt.",1
"In addition to the sample, some beautiful keys lace the beat as well.",0
"The overall effect is dreamy, and sounds kind of trippy as well.",0
"Ak follows the lead of the beat here, dropping some vague Raekwon type stream of thought ish.",0
"I THINK he's doing the""aliens"" thing again, but I'm not too sure.",1
A dope track for the beat anyways.,0
12) Live Long,0
A weird weird weird beat supplied by Thes-One of People Under The Stairs here.,0
"It's very hard to describe, but I'll try.",0
"After a pretty normal beginning with some basic drums, this VERY weird loop enters play.",0
"I THINK it's a single key piano key, distorted, and then altered in a way that makes it sound like it's underwater.",0
"Regardless, it's dope.",0
"Lyricswise, once again Ak lives up to the beat provided, dropping some dope multisyllable type rhymes, and some surprisingly deep lyrics on life.",0
""" Look not to my external",0
Cuz what's external will one day return to the inferno,0
But what's internal is eternal,0
What's in my journal does not concern you,0
"Learn to respect the intellect or my fire will burn you""",0
13 ) Hold On,0
"Wow, what a beat provided by Parker Lee.",0
Best on the album bar none.,1
"This sounds like something straight from the Wu-Tang, with some deep bass, a 4/4 drum pattern, and the cherry on top - a vocal loop of a woman singing""hold on"".",0
The end result is very eerie instrumental.,0
Incredible.,0
"The lyrics are up to par as well, as Ak sends out a message to anyone who's in need of spiritual or emotional uplifting.",0
""" It's all the same in the hall of fame",0
I just wanna be ready when He calls my name,0
This material world is a ball and chain,0
"Live your life righteous or it's all in vein""",0
14)Dedication,0
"As the title would suggest, Ak uses this track to remember all those that have passed on.",0
"A suitably sadder track comprised of a haunting acoustic guitar, and a slow bassline makes up the beat.",0
"Think sad thoughts, and you'd get the mood of this track.",0
"Ak is perfect lyrically here, reflecting on life and death.",0
Incredible performance.,0
""" To all my peoples who ain't hear no more",0
"When we can't shed tears, we pour beer on the floor",0
"To remember the dead, I hand my head in sorrow",0
And ask God for the strength to face tomorrow,0
"Cuz I know, when I leave this physical frame that",0
Half of y'all probably won't remember my name,0
"Try to take me out, but you can never douse this flame",0
"I foresaw my funeral, only the real heads came""",0
15 ) Hot Ya Hot,0
"The original to the remix found earlier on the LP, and once again M-Boogie is on the boards.",0
"Ill cuts again, and the difference between the cuts is based almost purely on a different drum scheme.",0
It sounds close though.,0
"I prefer the original though, which sounds like it's flipped the sample used by Dilated Peoples on"" Work the Angles"".",0
This is vintage M-Boogie right here.,0
Ak as usual rips it.,0
16)Those Who Say ( DJ Revolution Remix ),0
"Rev serves up another dope slab of a beat, with a horn backbone, and some rattling noises.",0
The chorus features a cool little electro-tinged piano loop.,0
"The overall effect is pretty downbeat, something I've never really heard from Rev as a producer.",1
Tons better than the original though.,0
Lyrics remain the same as the original.,0
"A quick note - the last two tracks are exclusives to the CD, so all y'all backwards cassette kids will miss out on them.",0
So what has M-Boogie unearthed?,0
Looks like a diamond.,0
"This is one of the top 3 albums of the year thus far, EASILY.",0
"Like his press clippings say, Ak looked to bring the art of emceeing back with this release, and I'd say he succeeded in stunning fashion.",0
"Cross your fingers that this gets it's shine, because it'd be a shame to see such talent get ignored.",0
One of the best debuts I've ever heard.,0
"An easy 4.5, and very close to a perfect score.",0
I walked into my favorite record store in Lincoln and heard something beautiful.,0
The sound of good hip-hop that I never heard before.,1
"Not only was it good, but when something moves you on the first listen you know it will be a classic.",1
"What I was hearing was the 9th track on this album"" San Francisco Knights"" I had to own a copy of this song, so I asked for a 12"".",0
"I was told there wasn't one, I had to buy the whole album if I wanted it.",1
I am normally not a person who buys an album based on one song.,1
I spend to much money on music to waste it on 12 or 15 tracks I don't listen to.,0
"But this was different, I had to take a chance.",0
I broke down and spent $ 18 on the double LP.,0
"When I listened at home I was not let down...what a great album, with so many great beats.",1
"I could go through this album track by track for all 16 songs, but since you probably won't read that I'll just focus on the highlights, and maybe one or two lowlights.",1
The People Under the Stairs are a different type of hip-hop group.,0
"Lyrically they are great, but aren't the type of group I would normally like.",1
"The subjects most covered on this album are drinking, smoking and partying.",0
"That's all fine, in fact I really like the fact that a lot of hip-hop is about just having fun, but I think it can be more than that and have a message or say something somewhat profound.",0
"This album doesn't have much of a positive message, which is my only problem with it.",1
"Despite that last fact, P.U.T.S. has actually put together a very creative album.",0
"Although, the songs are about partying, drinking and even doing a few illegal things, the group brings it down to the level of the average fan.",0
"A great example is the song"" Mid-City Fiesta.""",0
"As you listen, you can almost watch a movie of the duo hitting the town on a warm San Francisco Night or a summer night in L.A.",0
"Now, on to the best thing about this album, the beats.",0
"The groups DJ/MC Double K has put together some phenomenal beats, mixing a few classic hip-hop sounds with rare, super funky gems from his crates.",0
"The title track"" The Next Step"" is a perfect example of this.",0
P.U.T.S. also manages to work some interesting voice samples into the album.,0
"On"" San Francisco Knights"" and the last track"" Play it Again"" the group mixes those phrases in with funky bass lines underneath.",0
"Another plus for this album, for all the underground hip-hop fans, is that it is one of those rare albums that can serve as a transition album for your friends who listen to pop hip-hop.",0
"A lot of people dismiss a lot of underground hip-hop as""weak"" because it doesn't talk about shooting someone or treating your woman like garbage, or it is too political.",1
"This album is somewhere between the two extremes, and I have actually used this album to get some of my friends to start giving some records a chance even though they are not what everyone talks about and aren't on MTV and BET everyday.",1
"So, if you don't have it, go out and pick up a copy.",1
It's worth it.,0
"Almost a year after I first picked it up"" San Francisco Knights"" is still one of my favorite hip-hop songs and each time I listen to the album I hear something new.",0
Alcatraz is arguably the most infamous prison on our planet.,0
"Built in the early 1900's, housing names like Al Capone, Alcatraz is considered one of the harshest, most impenetrable prisons ever.",0
"San Francisco rapper Rasco, living near the facility himself, utilizes the prison as a metaphor for his label struggles.",0
"The label in particular that he is implying about is Copastik Records, headed by Jon Saxton.",0
"After""escaping"" that""prison,"" Rasco found his way to Coup D'Etat Records, and he relishes his new freedom with this new album.",0
"The Intro kicks off the album with sampled soundbites describing the hopelessness of Alcatraz, the desolate inescapable prison.",0
"After this setting-setter, we get Get Free.",0
"Here, Rasco uses Alcatraz to symbolize two separate things.",0
"First, he uses it to urge people to""escape"" from whatever is holding them back in life.",0
"The second meaning is more personal, which is his own struggles with his previous label.",0
"He calls out Jon Saxton here, talking about his previous adversity in the industry.",0
Building upon personal setbacks is U Got The Time.,0
"Over a relaxing, soulful guitar loop, his verses flow easily on this uplifting song.",0
Here he once again urges his listeners to break free of everything keeping them from doing what they want.,0
"Rasco's songs have an uplifting message, while managing to keep his tracks down-to-earth and more happy than sad.",0
"The Sweet Science features Jurassic 5 member Chali 2Na, and the two MC's trade the first two verses and share the third.",0
"Here, they use a boxing metaphor as a symbolism for their battle rhymes.",0
"The beat is more bouncy, featuring samples and strings, and it seems more geared towards Chali 2Na.",0
There are other nice guest appearances as well.,0
San Fran To The Town features Casual form the Hieroglyphics.,0
"Here the thick guitar loop meshes with Casuals nice-sounding flow, and its laid-back and relaxing.",0
"And on Endless, Planet Asia pops in for an upbeat track that complements their speedy flow.",0
"My Life is another bouncy track, where Rasco touches on an array of things, from politics to morals ( politics and morals in the same sentence?! ).",0
"After an Interlude, Rasco drops the passively venomous Snakes In The Grass ( The Jon Sexton Story ).",0
"Rasco calmly tells of his legal brawls with Copastik Records and Jon Saxton, accusing them of stealing his songs, his money, his career.",0
"He tells about how he was fighting to leave them, and his reaction now that he is free.",0
"Then it shifts from a narrative to a battle track, and he calmly rips apart Jon Saxton's label, rapping like he couldn't care less about the label, yet dropping vicious lines.",0
"This sort of song is reminiscent of Common's Cube-diss, because both songs feature an artist who is not known for his viciousness who lashes out and obliterates his opponent in the most laid-back way possible.",1
"All I Wanna Be closes out the album, with guitar strings and Kisha Griffin singing the chorus.",0
"Here, Rasco raps as if he is confessing, telling us what he wants in the future, and his desire to""escape"" the route his career in rapping has taken to this point in time.",0
"And with this personal note, the album ends.",0
"Rasco's newest LP is one of the best of 2003, get it now.. his talent on the mic was not""imprisoned"" on this album, and your urge to buy it should not be either.",1
Ras branches out into many different aspects of rap.,0
"From dissing, to introspect, to retrospect, Rasco lays it down skillfully with enough greatness to make Jon Saxton wish he wasn't such a moron.",1
"Congratulations Copastik, Rasco just made all of you look like the conformist""imprisoning"" label you really are.",0
Heads unfamiliar with the name Defari probably have not been paying much attention to the resurgence of West Coast Hip-Hop over the past few years.,1
"A deejay-turned-teacher-turned emcee, Defari Herut has gained respect in Hip-Hop the old-fashioned way  through skill, hard work, and determination.",0
"Though his noteworthy relationship with Tommy Boy Records ended shortly after his 1999 Focused Daily debut dropped, Defari continued to toil at his craft solo and with Tha Liks as a Likwit Crew member.",0
"With high-profile verses on Dr. Dres Chronic 2001 and Dilated Peoples much-admired 2001 release, Expansion Team hipping a larger audience to Defari, the artist returned to the lab to craft his new album, Odds and Evens.",0
"An amazing mix of impressive lyricism, devastating beats, and exciting collaborations, this release should establish O.G.",0
Duane Johnson  as a major fixture in the Wests rap scene from this moment on.,0
"Having survived a long and turbulent career, Defari has beaten the odds; now it s time to get even.",0
"Since it s an album from a member of the Likwit Crew, you know you can expect collaborations with Tha Liks, and Defari definitely delivers in this department on Odds and Evens.",0
"Featuring lyrics and production by E-Swift, Inner City  is a great album opener.",0
"On this percussion-driven head-nodder, Defari and E rhyme extraordinarily well together, even when Swift spits sobriety-questioning lines like, mind been corrupt since I was a young buck / getting caught with my pants down beatin it up. ",0
"Tash brings his inexhaustible energy to Xtra Thump,  the perfect personality for taking Fredwrecks archetypal keyboard-crafted party anthem to a higher level of rowdiness.",0
"Likwit Crew member Phil Da Agony also manages to jump in a session for Stay Bubblin,' though he might have been better waiting for a different song to appear on.",0
"The production work on this is far too innocuous to properly complement the combined venom Agony and Defari lay down, killing the collabos potential.",0
"With vocals that almost cry out hard drums and a grinding bassline, hopefully a remix will pop up as a bonus on a later release.",0
"However, the Likwit Crew are not the only ones to bless Odds and Evens with an appearance; Dilated Peoples makes their presence felt on one of the singles from this album, the remix of Behold My Life. ",1
"Babu outdoes himself here, producing a rich soul track laced heavily with old-school strings, and even whispers of Al Green drifting in from the shadows.",0
"Lyrically, Rakaa, Evidence, and Defari describe incidents in their lives that drove them to be successes today.",0
"Defari reminisces, behold my life, a deejay turned emcee/ T La Rock Its Yours  blew my m-i-n-d/ made me want to be the D-to-the-E/ crowned 310 king of Los Angeles city. ",0
"Despite the impressive roster of guest artists, Defari is certainly capable of tearing down the mic without any collaborators and does so often.",1
"Hooks  is yet another powerful banger that allows the emcee to show the appropriate lack of respect for fruity, catchy hook-addicted commercial rappers over Barbershop Kizs dramatic, string-driven composition.",1
"He continues the hostilities with Spell My Name,  the lead single, co-produced by Evidence and Porse.",0
"This track is essentially an anthem for the Likwit emcee as he flexes raw braggadocio in his highly adaptable rhyme style, commanding you to spell his name in the chorus.",0
"Musically, Ev and Porses work sounds a bit like a fresher rendition of some of Dr. Dres best work; a defiant march with critical musical points fortified supplementary samples, including a strangely appealing blubbery trombone.",0
"Without a doubt, Odds and Evens is a nothing less than stellar release for Defari.",1
"The production is excellent, pulling some of the sharpest beats from respected names and relative unknowns ( hell, none Alchemists cuts even made it onto the final release, and you wont miss em ).",1
Evidence proves to be just as solid an asset behind the boards for Defari as he is on the mic for DP; his remarkable production work here can only heighten the anticipation of Dilateds next effort.,0
"Lyrically, Defari knows exactly how to complement the beats with a versatile and dexterous flow, rocking rhymes that blend only the best of Cali Hip-Hop  aggressive without the trite gangsta posturing, fun-loving but with an undeniable sense of responsibility.",1
"Even if Defari has long since abandoned teaching as a profession, his new album Odds and Evens proves that theres still much to learn from this man.",0
Who is Defari?,0
"Honestly, I don't know.",1
I only picked this one up based on tips from Madtheory and paulyoungotti.,0
Knowing that they are ber appreciators of quality hip-hop made the choice as easy as jumpin in my ride.,0
"My sources tell me that Odds and Evens is Defaris second full-length release, the first one being Focused Daily.",0
"Based on the dopeness of the former, I really want to snipe the latter.",0
It also seems as though he is intimately connected to Dre and his posse ( no surprise there coming from LA ).,1
The first thing that hit me about Odds and Evens was the tightness of the production ( mainly by E-Swift and Evidence of Dilated Peoples ).,0
I typically listen to music in my car.,0
My stereo is relatively bangin so it's a good place to test quality.,0
Good production in hip-hop usually equals how tightly the bass and beats come out the speakers at high volume.,0
"Often, bass starts to bleed, escaping the parameters of the speaker cone, creating distortion and even blowing speakers.",0
There's no bleeding hear.,1
The best example of this is on the track Xtra Thump featuring Tash.,0
"The tune is basically heavy and bumpin with lots of the lows, the same ones directly associated with that earthquake feeling you get when sitting at a red light next to one of those scary looking cars with the tinted windows, supa shiny rims, and wide-a** tires that seem way too small.",0
"Defari harkens back, reminding people that he can still kick-it with the best.",0
"The lows stay tight to the speakers, almost lifting the car with the volume cranked.",0
The adrenaline rush I got reminded me of high school when I used to crank Def Leppard and Accept.,0
Fun stuff!,0
Another thing that struck me about Odds and Evens was the variety of the lyrical content.,0
Defari comes across as a seasoned professional.,0
He brings up all kinds of subjects.,0
There is only one interlude and only one cut shorter than 2 minutes.,0
"The combination of Defaris mature west coast sound, tight lyrics, and smooth vocal style create a lethal dose of BANG.",0
"Although I like ALL of the tracks ( pretty impressive these days ), here are some of my standouts:",0
Inner City has one of coolest hooks kinda like lowbump-bump-bump-bump-bump-bump-bumpbumpbumpbump-lowbump over a straightforward beat that hits with precision and purpose.,0
"Very west coast, very Dre inspired, very tough and nasty.",0
Cold Pieces also has a hook that got stuck in my cranium long after the sound waves dissipated.,0
The theme and feel is again high west coast.,0
"Tribal, eerie, otherworldly, and tough.",0
The title refers to the wonderful women of LA.,0
"Clever, eh?",0
Take The Weight Of My Hand is smooth and relaxed.,0
Here Defari tells us a little about what makes him tick.,0
The syncopated bass line on the low mixes with the shrill pinning of keys on the high to create a tension that is only broken by Defaris smooth flow.,0
Lots of confidence and attitude in this one although not in-your-face.,1
Xtra Thump you already know how this goes.,0
Bang it loud!,0
Los Angelinos is a lovely orchestrated joint accented by a simply complex key hook that sets a mellow mood.,0
"With no apparent urgency, Defari gives props to his hometown.",1
"Its a great track to kick to on a sunny day in August ( the dog days ), cruising the street with one hand one the wheel just checkin things out.",0
"As I stated earlier, Odds and Evens doesn't contain a weak track.",1
There are 10 others that I did nt mention as favorites but that s just because people have short attention spans these days ( myself included ).,0
"I could, would, should give props to Spell My Name ( the video single ), the beautifully edgy Hooks, regal title track Odds and Evens, or even the bass and horns of the finale Stay Bubblin, etc.",0
Need I say more?,0
"Well, only that if you are a fan of west coast hip-hop, simply want a place to start your west coast experience, or have a pulse and a CD player, you should get down to your local music peddler and pick up Odds and Evens.",0
Defari is at the top of his game.,0
"Also, further props to E-Swift and Evidence of Dilated Peoples for their quality handling of the production duties.",0
Top shelf!,0
Louis Logic has only been around for a short time.,0
"He has released two CD-ROMs, Music to Drink By: A Collection of Loosies and Exclusives  and Debacle in a Bottle: a not album, two excellent releases that basically compile the whole of his discography in two goes, mainly composed of 12 singles, bootlegs, unreleased tracks and exclusives.",0
"The title Sin-A-Matic is itself a play on cinematic  in short Louis Logic decided to present the various sins  he likes to indulge in, in a various number of creative and cinematic ways.",0
"Its an intriguing idea on paper, but concepts are only worthy if you make them work...",0
"Ironically, the opening cuts of"" Sin-A-Matic"" are typical of many modern rap albums - something that's perhaps confusing at first. Louis Logic comes out swinging in his opening bars from the Sintro;"" My CD is diseased, please be cautious |Cause each queasy chorus will leave ya nauseous | Each verse is equipped with evil forces | For teachin' your kids how to be remorseless"".",0
It's a short freestyle introducing his album - a typical rap album feature - and it gives you a good idea of his skill as an emcee ( check the multi's ).,0
Louis then couples his braggadocio with blunt thoughts on the state of the rap game in the magnificent Street Smarts:  Whatcha think cause ya neck and ya wrist go bling | That ya sh!t don't stink?,0
Fa**ot asses doin' the Sisqo thing in a thong | Y'all ain't never had a inkling of thinkin' of bringin' it on | Take my advice shorty | Before I make your life story the sad sh*t RandB bit*hes sing in a song.,0
"This is one of the angriest songs on the album but most importantly it demonstrates his ridiculous flow and hard-hitting wordplay, coupled with a distinctive voice.",0
"Add the standout guest collaboration with Demigodz member Celph Titled on the fake emcee dismantling"" Diablos"" and the opening of the album is lyrically potent, if not all too disimilar from many others.",1
"But in an industry crammed full of imitation after imitation, Louis Logic does stand out.",0
"The conceptual inventiveness that is found throughout"" Sin-A-Matic"" is unique.",0
"Take  Freak Show, an indication of the rappers eccentric side, as he adjusts his vocal tone to a highly odd accent and vividly describes all kinds of societys weirdos, over a minimalist, bouncy fairground-inspired beat.",0
"His twisted, dark humour is literally on show here: he reminds me of Brotha Lynch Hung or the pre 2002 Eminem.",0
"Fair Weather Fan is one of my favourite songs, and it finds Louis presenting both the views of several fans and critics about his music and his own response to these resulting criticisms, over Memos wonderfully dark, computer-inspired beat.",0
The best and most controversial song is undoubtedly The Ugly Truth.,0
"Over another solemn, eerie beat this time crafted by The Record Collecter, Louis satirises the views of racist America by describing several minority races through mockery of standard racial stereotypes and rhetoric.",0
You have to hear it to see how well done it is but it demonstrates to the letter how creative Louis Logic is; I have never heard a song quite like this one.,1
"He's got one hell of an imagination; his storytelling is on a par with Nas or Ice Cube, and the worlds he constructs are fantastical and weird.",0
It follows that one of the main features of Louis Logics philosophy towards life is that he does nt really take too much seriously; you won't see much political or social commentary instead Louis uses the creative side of his brain.,1
"Coochie Coup  is an enjoyable song about one of his main passions, sex.",0
Spitting lines like You see as much as I love pu**y | you can't feed it to me because I don't eat anything that bleeds for a week and don't die and sporting ODB lines for the hook it s a funny way at looking at typical subject matter.,0
"And yes, even when he switches up the subject matter, he avoids any laziness and keeps the complexity of his rhymes.",0
"Dos Factuom is just a beautiful song, as Louis describes a wild night out when heavily inebriated  alcohol is his other main passion.",0
"Whats best about this song, however, is the magnificent production by J.J. Brown  were talking about lilting/JJ|VBG guitars and a dreamy horn sample creating a really surreal atmosphere.",0
"And that brings me nicely onto J.J Brown s considerable talent as a beatmaker; next to Madlib, Stoupe and R2JD this guy has to be one of the best underground producers around.",0
"Not one song on this album is below par beatswise, and he provides 90 % of them.",1
"Postal has a wonderful switching beat; starting off with cheeky trumpets and a cavernous bassline then changing to a bouncy piano-blessed instrumental, which is great backing to a hilariously inventive story of two halves from Louis Logic about a fed-up and bored office worker who eventually goes postal  a sly satire of a plague of modern American society.",0
"The best of the best, though, is the wonderful lead single Idiot Gear.",0
"Over one of the catchiest choruses and keyboard loops Ive heard for a long time  it s like a distant cousin of Gang Starrs Mass Appeal (yeah, THAT good )  Louis kicks fast flowing and charismatic lyrics about why you might not want to find out about an ex-girlfriends exploits with her past boyfriends.",1
"Its an unashamedly male song, and most blokes Im sure will be able to relate to it.",0
"Needless to say, the great production is simply only a continuation of J.J. Brown s work on the rest of the album.",0
Sin-A-Matic surprised me.,0
"I knew it was going to be good, but I did nt realise quite how good. Louis Logic conforms to no stereotypes or trends; he does his own thing; while his twisted humour might offend some it simply confirms to me that he is something different from much of the brainless crap that has invaded mainstream rap.",1
"Theres not a weak track, this is top three of 2003 material, check it out  especially if you are a big Underground Hip Hop fan.",1
"Many people who listen to hip-hop, even underground hip-hop, have absolutely no clue who the Demigodz are.",1
The Demigodz have been hailed as the new comical version of the Wu-Tang Clan.,0
"The Demigodz are a huge group, embedded deep within the underground, specifically the east coast underground scene.",0
"The extremely talented organization consists of a whopping 13 members, which includes 10 emcees and 13 producers / djs.",0
Its pretty interesting that they can compose an entire label with just these emcees.,0
"Each emcee has his own personality and style, but they honestly are all ill emcees who have competed and won a variety of battle competitions.",0
"The Demigodz are: the humorous Apathy, who has been hailed as the new Eminem, Celph Titled, Open Mic, Louis Logic, complex intelligent emcee Esoteric, Rise, El-Fudge, Spin 4th, One-Two, and Motive.",0
"The DJs are 7L, Chum the Skrilla Guerilla, and Franky Needles.",0
These 13 individuals make up the Demigodz.,0
"In 2002, they released an underground EP entitled The Godz Must Be Crazy, which is just a taste of what is in store from these emcees.",0

""" Intro"" is HILARIOUS from the start and puts a smile to my face.",0
"First of all, it is a sheer copy of the intro to Dr. Dre's The Chronic, even the very same G-Funk beat to start it.",0
"Apathy does his best Snoop Dogg impression, introducing the Demigodz in the same way that Dr. Dre's album began, with pure trash talk.",0
"Apathy claims that now its beyond battling, now they go to shows and fight people, in which he is claiming of the incident in New York a few months before where the Celph Titled went on stage during underground rapper Cage's performance, and got into a fist-fight with him because he refused to battle, which is all apart of the beef between the Eastern Conference All-Stars and the Demigodz... LONG STORY.. but now lets get to the album...",0
""" Science of the Bumrush"" kicks off the album.",0
"Apathy starts the song by hitting us with tight humorous storytelling lyricism similar to the way Eminem used to do, with very tight battle raps and stories.",0
"Its amazing how well these guys can write lyrics, and its shown on this track.",0
"Its funny, well-written, and very lyrical, with multi-syllable flows and multi-bar rhyme schemes.",0
These guys are on their way to being legends if they keep this up.,0
"The beat is also tight, featuring a hard assortment of trumpets and horns, and some low bass.",0
"The Demigodz continue with"" Captivate Deactivate"".",0
"Esoteric, Celph Titled, Open Mic, and Apathy give us another underground classic.",0
"All of these emcees drop awesome verses over some melancholy production, with synthesized drums, and fast violin.",0
"Celph lays a clever diss to Eve, calling her a crack-wh*re.",0
"Apathy lays down a tight verse against commercial rap, giving us some VERY VERY Clever rhymes:"" And y'all ain't basement, y'all are locked in the cellar / Ain't sayin sh*t like a Helen Keller acapella / And we originated"" Root Beers"" for ya frigid air / So emcees had to get day-jobs with Medicare"" Awesome...",0
"Apathy and Celph Titled trade verses on"" The Demigodz"", showcasing one of the most memorable punchlines ever:"" Rappers are gettin wrecked due to lack of respect / Cuz y'all couldn't get signed if you was the back of a check"".",0
I had to rewind that to hear it... so clever.,0
Both emcees drop humorous battle raps similar to how Eminem would do.,0
"The chorus is funny and memorable, dissing other emcees, and laying down some disses towards Eastern Conference All-Stars.",0
"Celph Titled comes off with some funny-a** sh*t on this track: I am the feature presentation, your rhymes are just a segment / A b*tch could just look at me, and get herself pregnant / I make bustin a gat look good cuz I hold it well / In second grade I brought a live grenade to class for show-and-tell""",0
"Louis Logic, Apathy, and Celph Titled come together on"" Off the Chrome"".",0
"Same idea as before, hilarious battle rhymes, aimed at the Eastern Conference All-Stars.",0
"In between the verses, we get an interlude about a crazed fan, as they kick tight freestyles, with the beat changing each time.",0
"The first is more of a laid-back style, and the second has some slamming bass, and the third sounds a little bit like both.",0
"This is a nice concept track, driven by amazing punchlines.",0
"Celph Titled sounds kinda disturbed on here by the way, so everybody knows.",0
"The same three emcees return on the head-bobbing"" Dont you even go there"".",0
The track features humorous punchlines over some funky productions.,0
The Godz Must be Crazy EP ends with the title track where every member of the Demigodz appears to drop verses.,0
"No catchy choruses, no special hooks, just pure lyricism.",1
"During the track, the beat is altered every once and a while a tiny bit, to make it sound fresh and not repetitive, which is a great idea by the Demigodz.",1
"These are some amazing, punchline driven battle raps which explains why these guys are so good as battling.",0
"In my personal opinion, Louis Logic, Apathy, Motive, and Rise drop the illest rhymes... check out this sample from Louis' verse:",0
"I'm a Demigod, what'd you expect?",0
From a man,0
"who met Mother Nature, looked under her dress and wasn't impressed",1
The same stupid son of a b*tch who doesn't respect,0
The Angel of Death's request when he comes to collect,0
"Run in and check, my cassette - it's a slight chance",0
"you might see, demons escapin from in the deck, and now that I...",0
""" Sweet Jesus, please see us through this",0
"I ain't tryna die over a beef with Louis!""",0
But when I increase the rudeness of my evil music,0
"It leaves the stupid, people skewered and leaks ya fluids",0
"into the streets and sewers, if by chance God sees me do it",0
Should shoot a big hole down to Hell and lead me to it,0
WOW!,0
The Demigodz win the award for Best New Hip-Hop Group with this EP.,0
The Godz Must be Crazy EP is one of those albums that should be owned by collectors and hard underground hip-hop heads.,0
"Its fresh, extremely well produced, and hilarious.",0
You will be rewinding the album more than once to hear those hilarious punchlines that they drop.,0
"When it comes to subject matter, they dont deviate from battle raps, which is sad, but good since its what they do best and of course, this is just the EP, the introduction of the Demigodz.",0
"This is more than deserving of 5 stars, but im going to give it 4 because of its shortness.",0
"But i highly reccomend buying this if youre in the mood to laugh and got some extra money lying around, cause they are right,"" The Gods MUST be crazy...""",0
"Cam has been around for a little while now, and has come from Sports, Drugs, and Entertainment to Confessions, now to his greatest solo album so far, COME HOME WITH ME.",0
"Cam Ron and the Diplomats being the new act on the juggernaut record company Roc-A-Fella records, has been the biggest signing in the east since the Yankees signed Jeter.",0
"This new Cam Ron shocks the world, and no person in their right mind would have thought it to be a hit.",1
"Cam Ron has come with more lyrics on this album, and he gets very deep on a couple songs.",0
One thing that sets Cam apart is his hooks and chorus'.,0
"He has three hit singles, which had every club on the western hemisphere bobbing their heads.",0
This is an album that wont disappoint if you were to purchase.,1
Cam Ron makes you respect his different style because he is filling a void in the industry.,0
"I mean he is doing it his way, which only takes one word to explain, PINK.",0
Most people dont respect his uniqueness in the industry and his style of rapping and doing things.,1
"This is a album that is out of the norm, and it leaves you with your mouth open, Cam is doing it big.",0
"There are only a couple negatives, the beats get boring towards the end of the CD, and he gets repetitive, but other than that it is a good CD.",0
Here Are A Few Reviews of Songs:,0
1 ) INTRO - Even the intro is good.,0
"He starts off with legendary DJ Kay Slay, and then goes into ripping the beat apart, from the intro you can tell he is coming with something hot on this CD.",0
Song Rating: 4 Microphones,0
"2 ) LOSING WEIGHT PART 2- Cam and the rest of the diplomats tears up this song, they discuss how they lose weight, as in drug weight, the lyrics are the hot on the track, and it is what I believe to be the grimiest beat on the album, they kept the lyrics Grimy too.",0
Song Rating: 4 Microphones,0
3 ) OH BOY- well this song sort of speaks for itself.,0
"Everybody knows this street anthem, and Cam even made a actual cologne named"" Oh Boy."" Oh boy is a song where the hook actually made the song.",0
There has even been rumors that they made the song in 20 minutes because they freesyled it.,0
"Well, you can tell, the lyrics arent to strong, and if more time would have been put in they could have done 10 times better.",1

"4 ) LIVE MY LIFE ( LEAVE ME ALONE) - This is the most gansta beat of all time coming from one of the greatest, 2pac, from his"" Ambition as a Rider"" hit.",0
"It very dangerous to sample one of the best beats of all time, Cam did the beat some justice though, he ripped it.",0
Song Rating: 4 1/2 Microphones,0
5 ) DAYDREAMING - This is an awful thug love song.,0
"He comes nowhere close to Jigga's"" Song Cry.""",0
"It has entirely too much singing and only a couple short verses, it definitely has no playtime in my player.",1
Song Rating: 1 1/2 Microphones,0
6 ) COME HOME WITH ME- This is a song where Cam shows off some of the skills of his Dip Set peeps.,0
"It is not a song that will knock you off your feet, but the lyrics was nt all that bad because they all had a couple of good punch lines, so it is not all that bad, but the beat is annoying.",1
Song Rating: 3 Microphones,0
"7 ) WELCOME TO NEW YORK CITY- Now Cam is getting the meat of the album, JAY-Z, good move by Cam to get label mate and legendary rapper Jay-Z on the track.",0
They are discussing their stomping grounds and I love it.,0
"It is definitely the best song on the album, and what I think should have been the first single, but Cam came hard with the lyrics, and Jay-z always does so in my estimation, this is a hit.",0
Song Rating: 5 Microphones,0
"8 ) HEY MA - We all know this as the second single off the album, but it is not that bad.",1
The beat is crazy and it fits perfectly with the mood of the song as a whole.,0
"The video is even better with one-legged Frankie with Gucci crutches throws a crutch away and starts c-walking, very creative and humorous.",0
The song has a good hook but the lyrics were a little too basic and nursery rymish.,0
Song Rating: 3 1/2 Microphones,0
"9 ) ON FIRE TONIGHT- Well, now we see a little bit of the Dip Sets hype man, Freaky Zekey in Action, the skit before the song where he talks about a female burning  him ( for you all who dont know what burning is, it is women having a STD, and a man having intercourse with her without a condom on ) and he makes it funny to get burnt.",1
Cam goes in and talks about that touchy situation.,0
Its Funny!,0
Song Rating: 4 Microphones,0
10 ) STOP CALLING - This a song that I believe to be even funnier.,0
"This is a song that starts off with a man callin Cam to ask him di he f*** his girl, and Cam plays with him and asks him whos your girl, then Cam starts rapping on the situation and all that he and his crew did to her, for example:",0
"Well, I'ma tell you straight up, homeboy cause it's a cold world",0
"Your wife, I call her"" Oh girl"" her head makes my toes curl",0
"And she awfully thick, help me get off these bricks",0
"Coffee kick, but after I bust, I be like"" Get the f**k off me b***h""",0
"If she front, bruise her in the ribs",0
"But you hugged her, you loved her, moved her in the crib",0
"Hit by cupid, stupid, why'd you do it?",0
Why be bother?,0
Why you holla?,0
"Three babies, three baby fathers",0
"Get wise kid, open your eyelids, cause that last abortion?",0

"Said you like to lay up dog, and play footies",0
"But she need a ni**a with timbs, gats and straight hoodies",0
Thats only the first verse of the song.,0
I believe that this is the best song lyrically on the album because of the crazy play with words.,0

Reasons to buy:,0
1. Originality,0
2. Personality of Cam,0
There are certain things that just can't be touched.,1
"One of those things just happens to be Da Brat's current album"" Unrestricted.""",0
"On this album she proves to be more talented and in touch with who she really is compared to"" Anutha Tantrum"" and"" Funkdafied.""",0
"Her singles have become more than just songs that one hears on the radio, but instruments that we wake up and sing, get crunk, or relate our everday lives to.",0
"It may not be suitable for those 14 years and under due to the explicit content, but with anthems such as"" That's What I'm Lookin For,"" Da Brat is bound for success.",1
Da Brat does have her PG-rated comments leaving her to restrict some of her audiences.,0
"With titles such as"" Whatchu Like,"" F**k You,"" and"" All My B*tches,"" it isn't surprising that some parents are forbidding their children from listening her songs in their homes.",1
"The fact that she has this PG-rated edge shows that she has matured since Funkdafied, thus, leaving her to gain a new audience ( the more mature ) to almost replace the younger.",0
Her album is pure evidence that female artists/rappers have their work cut out for them.,0
"Da Brat is, somewhat of, a genius with her beats and lyrics ( that everyone is""biting"" ) She is proving to be more competition than anyone ever perceived.",0
Jermaine Dupri ( CEO of SoSoDef Productions )definitely saw talent in her soul when he picked her up out of Chi-Town.,0
"Hopefully, Da Brat will continue on her journey of what she perceives as success, proving to J.D., her family, and her world of fans that she definitely is unrestricted.",0
Da Brat~one of the most original rap and RandB stars out there.,0
"She has the funky sass of a rap star, and the elegant class of a woman.",0
"Her new cd attracted me from the song"" That's What I'm Looking For.""",0
"It had an amazing beat, cool words, and the music video showed many sides of Da Brat.",0
"Her growing up from the young disobedient thug girl, to now a woman, is definitely showed throughout her album.",0
"With appearances by Tyrese, JD and Lil John, Ja Rule..and many other great performers, her cd is hard to not listen to repeatedly.",1
Her flows and technique is far different from her other albums.,0
"She has matured, as well as her music and lyrical talent.",0
She still holds it down as one of the strongest and outspoken ladies of the hip-hop world today.,0
"If CDs full of energy is""what you're looking for"", I would recommend artists such as Dr. Dre, Eminem, Ja Rule, and The Cash Money Crew, and Eve.",0
"If you liked her before, you'll like her now.",0
"So go out and by the CD, you won't regret it.",0
I'm a big fan of Panasonic.,0
Their products are well designed and well built.,0
That's probably why the KX-TG5100M 5.8 GHz phone system was a disappointment.,0
First problem: Sound quality.,0
"Memory chips are inexpensive, but Panasonic saved money by putting a small memory chip in this system.",0
"Compression technology is utilized to fit 15 minutes of recorded messages onto the chip, and you can tell -- sound quality is AWFUL.",0
"Ironically, the best sound quality comes from the old analog answering machines that still use cassette tapes.",0
( So much for technological advance. ),0
Second problem: The power pack consists of three cheap NiCd AA batteries encased in plastic.,0
"Even worse, they're very low capacity NiCds -- just 850 mAh.",0
( NiCd is the old technology for rechargeable batteries.,0
Cadmium is a nasty environmental toxin.,0
"NiCd batteries drain quickly, even when not in use, and they have a""memory effect"": If you don't drain the power completely before a recharge, they'll only charge up to the current level on the next charge. )",1
"The phone handset only works a few hours before recharging is needed, and storing it on the charger base will significantly reduce the life of the batteries.",0
"If Panasonic had opted for the current technology of 2200-mAh NmH ( nickel metal hydride ) batteries, the 4-hr usage time could have been boosted to 10 hrs or more, with no memory effect.",1
"Enough cost cutting, Panasonic.",0
"If you're going to charge people so much for a product, build it with quality components.",0
Third problem: You have to endure a goofy voice that tells you things that could be more efficiently conveyed through visual indicators.,0
"I suppose an electronic voice is Panasonic's way of adding a"" Gee-wow"" factor, but it's another example of how new technology makes our lives less efficient.",0
Older answering machines have an LCD display that tells you how many new messages you have.,0
"This machine has just a tiny red light, so if you call-screen a message and don't erase it, you have no idea whether other messages have been added (unless you start pushing buttons ).",1
You have to waste time pressing buttons and listening to the voice every time.,0
"Also, you have to press extra buttons like Mailbox 1 every time, even though you never use other message""mailboxes"" (used for password-protected messages that can be storage for other users of the system ).",1
More gripes: The antennas on the base unit are five inches high.,0
They get in the way.,0
"Also, you can't hear your own voice in the handset, as you can with other phones.",0
It takes a while to get used to that.,0
"Also, the handset is fairly bulky and heavy.",0
"On the plus side, the range of a 5.8 GHz phone is fairly good ( although quality does degrade with distance ).",0
"I still worry about zapping my brain with high-energy radio signals, but going cordless is nice.",0
"Wish list: In addition to fixing the above-mentioned gripes, it would be great if there were a way to speed through boring messages.",0
"My old digital answering machine allowed me to increase the talking speed 1.3x and 1.6x, in addition to jumping back in 5-second intervals and slowing down the recorded message ( all without changing the pitch, and all controlled by a simple, intuitive jog dial ).",1
"The Panasonic does allow you to slow down the message playback, but that's it.",0
I'm kind of disappointed this expensive phone system.,0
"I used to have a Siemen's phone system, but the sound started to degrade after a few years, so I switched to this more expensive Panasonic system.",0
The phone has a nice feeling to it.,0
I like that you can choose the line you want to dial out on.,0
This feature was missing from the Siemens phone.,0
The illuminated keypad works very well.,0
"The volume control is easy to use when talking, but I wish it went a bit louder.",0
Sometime it's just not enough volume.,1
Now for the down side.,0
"The directory is not connected to the caller-id like on my cell phone, and my Siemens phones.",1
"What I mean by this is if a name exists in my directory with a phone number, I want that directory name to display instead of the default caller-ID name.",0
"Sometimes the caller-ID name is"" Unknown Name"", like every time for cell phones.",0
That doesn't do me any good at all.,0
Transfering is difficult on this phone.,0
"You can't just yell across the house"" Pick up the phone"".",1
You have to transfer the call.,0
"This is not always easy, because you have to ask what number extension are you holding.",1
"There are no labels on the extensions, just numbers.",1
I don't like the fact that each phone acts like it's a stand alone phone.,1
The system does not act like a system.,1
You can't share directories.,1
"This is a big minus, because you have to type in the directory for each phone.",0
"I have about 75 numbers, and names for a system of 4 phones.",0
"You can't clear the"" Received Calls"" label for the system.",1
"What's the point of buying a system, when the phones don't share.",1
"There is no mute button on the base, or any of the handsets.",1
The speakerphone does work well though.,0
"We had central air installed in our house, and it seems that the blower is interfering with the sound quality of any handset that gets within 10 feet of it.",0
Upside again:,0
I do use the general mailbox.,0
"That works well, and I can access it from the road.",0
"You can have multiple mailboxes, but I just use the general box.",0
"the phone uses NiMH batteries, and that's good.",0
"No interference from my wireless video camera, wireless computer network, or microwave.",1
No audio chopping when I move to distant parts of the house - I did have these problems at 2.4 GHz.,1
"I first tried a Uniden DCT-5260, 2.4 GHz model with 2 handsets - I don't see that model on ePinions.",0
I like the orange backlight and lack of visible antenna.,0
I have nothing else good to say about it.,0
The function keys are atrocious.,0
"I can find the Talk button easily, but the End button is just one of 6 identical buttons that are equally spaced around the large talk button.",0
What were they thinking?!,0
"To work with the caller ID list you have to press a button on the left, then one of two buttons on the right to scroll, then down to the bottom to use two poorly labelled buttons: one to delete, the other to confirm?",0
Most other phones - including the DCT-5260 - will use soft keys.,0
What were they thinking?!,0
When the phone is taken out of the charging cradle the LCD blanks out.,0
"It does activate when a call comes in, but on the DCT-5260 it stays on ( but not lit ) so that you can glance at it and see if there are any new calls on the list.",1
With this phone you have to press a button to reactivate the screen.,0
"I don't get it, LCD with light off consumes very little power.",1
What were they thinking?!,0
The DCT-5260 used AA NiMH batteries.,0
What a GREAT IDEA!,0
But this newer model uses a proprietary and smaller set of NiMH.,0
What were they thinking?!,0
"Storing numbers from caller ID was not easy, especially because the function keys required are scattered all over.",1
"I know I could've read the manual, but try to do this common function on a Nokia cell phone and you'll NEVER need the manual.",1
Imagine my dismay when I realized that long distance caller ID numbers can NOT be redialed!,1
"Yes, they left off the leading 1 (one ) and there's no option to make it store numbers with a 1.",1
"Finally, although the handset looks OK, I despised the retro base station look, so I made sure to buy the basic model with no speakerphone or answering machine.",1
Uniden needs to put a 5.8 GHz phone in the DCT-5260 package.,0
Now that I've concluded this review I realize that I must return the phone.,0
Stupidity should not be rewarded,1
Pros: decent speaker phone,0
Cons: short battery life breaks easily paint scratches off sounds horrible,0
"I had one for 3 months, and I just threw it away.",0
"It had poor sound quality from day 1, and everyone was always complaining to me that they couldn't hear my voice.",0
"Later on, the phone shorted out and the only way it would work reliably is in speaker phone mode.",0
"Also, the fancy painted plastic quickly started looking really bad, as the silver paint scratched easily (especially around the ear area ) and left ugly black marks on the phone.",0
"Suddenly, the phone looks really really cheap.",0
"Battery life was about 2 hours of talk time, which is ok but you can do better with 2.4ghz or 900mhz phones.",0
"I'm back to an older generation 900mhz phone now, and the voice quality is much better.",0
Pros: Great unless you're more than 10 feet away.,0
"Cons: Interface not intuitive, reception horrible,",1
These phones were purchased to replace a similar Vtech set and there is no comparison between the 2 systems.,1
"The Uniden phone system all the same features I was looking for, but in comparison, the Uniden phones weren't at ALL intuitive, I was constantly referring to the manual and the reception was just simply horrible.",1
"As the headline states, I just unloaded my Unidens on E-Bay for about half of what I paid and replaced them with another, comparible Vtech set.",0
"By the way, if you are in the market for cordless units, you can't go wrong with the Vtech units.",1
"I would post a review touting my appreciation of my new Vtech units, but at this time they aren't listed on epinions.com.",1
"About 20 years ago I had purchased Uniden cordless phone and despite the extra long telescopic antenna, I couldn't get more than 10 ft from the base.",0
But that was 1982 and no cordless phone worked perfect.,1
Over the years I witnessed new phones showing up on the market.,0
"So when I noticed this technological marvel with 5.4GHz frequency and very attractive silver finish, I immediately assumed that it must be better phone than my worn out Panasonics.",0
"The claim printed right on the front of the package""introducing the most powerful phones ever built"" assured me that I'm buying a quality product.",0
The phone has great features.,0
I like the push to talk option and 2 handsets.,0
The phone looks really great but it just doesn't work well.,0
At about 60 ft from the base you can hear static and about 100 ft away from the house conversation becomes impossible.,0
"Per instructions, I relocated base away from any possible interference, but this little beauty just didn't work.",0
My 900 MHz Panasonic costing $ 29.99 has more than double the range and there is virtually no static 200 ft away.,1
My old 2.7GHz 4-line Panasonic also outperforms Uniden by far.,0
This great looking Uniden reminds me of the crappy phones from the 80's.,0
Don't waste your time calling Uniden cusomer service.,1
"The so called""technician"" will read from the book about microwave ovens, computers and fluorescent lighting interfering with your phone.",0
The guy is very rude and keep pausing for a minute at the time and than tells me that I have a bad phone line in my house.,0
All other phones work just fine from the same line and so does Uniden when you're 20 ft away from the base.,0
Don't waste your time and money on this inferior product.,1
Pros,0
"5.8Ghz, ringtones, lightweight",0
Cons,0
"Cuts out, battery doesn't seem to be completely efficient",1
The Bottom Line,0
I would be wary of this product unless you know someone who has one that has performed well.,0
Full Review,0
So I was looking for phones some time before Thanksgiving last year and settled on trying to find Uniden phones.,0
Mostly because they had what I was looking for and they were fairly stylish and cheap.,0
I ended up getting the Uniden TRU-5865 2 pack which has a main cordless phone with a usable speakerphone base ( that plugs into a wall outlet and phone jack ) and then a satellite base and cordless receiver which only plus into the wall outlet.,0
"Let it be known, that I purchased this product off of eBay and that it was a new, refurbished model.",0
I charged the phones up for the suggested time before we started using them.,0
Then I transfered the phone list from our old phones to the new phones ( manually of course ).,0
"We were pretty happy with the phones at first, just the initial excitement of having something new and different.",0
"However, it seemed as though the batteries were not holding charge very well.",1
Then we also started noticing that the phone would cut out.,0
You could still talk and the person on the other end could hear you but you could not hear them.,1
It is a good thing we kept our old 2.4Ghz phones because that is what we are currently using.,0
These two problems have caused me to get rid of the Uniden phones.,0
"The phones themselves were comfortable to hold, came with belt clips which were handy, and had different ringtones ( which we had wanted ).",0
"However, the inability to use the phone without knowing whether it was going to cutout or not caused all the pros of this product to diminish.",1
"It is fair enough to say this may have been a lemon that was supposed to have been repaired to great condition, although the cutting out did not occur for the first couple months.",1
"But even so, what does that say about the service and warranty work about Uniden products?",0
"So, when I purchase more phones I will most likely not be going with Uniden.",1
I have had good experience with Panasonic and while they are expensive I would like something that works and is reliable.,0
Here are some of the details regarding these Uniden phones:,0
- 5.8 Ghz DSS technology,0
"- Up to 2 cordless handsets on same""network""",0
#NAME?,1
#NAME?,0
- 10 speed dial numbers,0
- up to 100 phonebook numbers able to be stored,0
- battery is supposed to last up to 192 hours standby and 4 hours of talk time,0
- has a 1 year warranty except refurbished items only have 90 days,0
"- i believe there are 10 different ringtones/rings you can choose from... a few classical type song ringtones, we wish you a merry christmas, etc",0
"There you have it, now you have all the information regarding this phone.",0
I have not had any other contact with Uniden products and this admittedly leaves a bad taste in my mouth.,1
My brother just bought some new Uniden phones and I am looking forward to seeing what his experience is with them.,0
Happy hunting.,0
Pros: Easy to find Talk button.,0
Cons: Sound quality is bad.,0
I have tried this model of cordless phone by Uniden and have brought it back twice to the store because the sound does not work on one of the phones.,1
"The volume cuts out when you are talking to someone and then you have to hit it to get it to come back on, which didn't always work.",0
I would suggest getting another cordless phone besides this one because the volume problems with the handset,0
I have been using this telephone for 4 months in a home office and the quality is unacceptable.,0
"First, battery life has become increasingly short, despite the fact that I have always followed the instructions to let the phone discharge entirely before putting it back in the recharging cradle.",0
"When I first got the phone, I had to recharge it about every 5-7 days.",0
"While not great, this is in keeping with the table in the manual which says that battery life in use ( talking ) should be 4.5 hours and in standby should be 11 days.",1
"Now, I find that I must recharge the phone every 36-48 hours and it goes from fully charged ( by the battery indicator on the phone ) to unusable very quickly.",0
Twice in recent days I have lost connection during a call because the phone died.,0
It used to be that I would have several minutes when it began a warning beep to finish the call or change phones.,0
"Today, I had seconds.",0
I am also unhappy with how the three mailboxes work.,0
"Messages are put in box 1 by default, and you can set a code for boxes 2 and 3.",0
"For example, I want my business messages to go to box 1 and home messages to go to box 2. So, when the machine picks up on my home line, my message says to press # 2 to leave a message.",0
"Unfortunately, the machine doesn't always respond promptly so that sometimes people end up pressing # 2 repeatedly without getting into the second mailbox, or they press # 2 but the message goes to mailbox 1.",1
I plan to try to return this to Panasonic.,0
"I bought it at Staples, which accepts returns for only 30 days.",0
The battery on this phone does not last long.,1
I have had the phone replaced ( by Panasonic and I had to pay for the shipping ) and I was sent another battery from Panasonic.,0
It just does not last.,1
I have found that it lasts about 2 hours.,0
I am so sorry I purchased the phone,0
5.8 Ghz great!,0
NiCad?,0
"Hmm...? In this day and age with cell phones, cameras and everything else using NiMH or better for at least 5+ years now, using the environmentally unfriendly, memory laden, short life NiCad battery seems like a choice of the ignorant.",0
My guess is that Panasonic's choice to use a NiCad battery on a phone that has all the bells and whistles is a money making choice.,0
If you have to replace the Panasonic proprietary battery every 6-9 months at $ 15 a pop that's a hard thing to let go of.,0
On the other hand it was a good enough reason for me to let go of this phone on the store shelf.,0
Panasonic is a good brand and this model is well designed but it is stuck in the DARK AGES when it comes to the battery used.,0
"As for technology... where's the Bluetooth wireless headphone and data sync, color screen, video games, face plates and everything else the average cell phone has these days?",0
"When it comes to the bigger picture, even the bells and whistles on this phone are nothing to get excited about.",0
Pros: Hands-free handset,0
Cons: Everything else...particularly the battery life!!!!!,0
I have had this phone for less than 4 months and the batteries don't even last one phone call.,0
I will charge the phone overnight and all day.,0
When I get home from school I can only make one to two phone calls before the handset needs recharging.,0
This is the absolute worst phone that I have ever had.,0
I wish that I could return it!!!!!!!,0
I finally got the courage to try a Vtech after reading about how they seem to be putting out pretty good phone products.,0
The reason I purchased this model is because I bought a studio that only has one phone jack in a not so convenient location.,1
So I was thinking just put the base near the phone jack and put handsets around wherever I wanted.,0
The first phone I bought worked a whole day...,0
"When I came home, suddenly the handset could not find the base.",1
I exchanged it for another one.,0
"The second one lasted a couple weeks, but suddenly the handset base stopped working so I couldn't charge it anymore.",1
So that was it...,0
I returned it and did not buy another.,1
I think I will stick with Panasonic!,0
Some of the things I liked about the Vtech:,0
1. the speakerphone in the handset actually worked really well,0
2. 8 different ringtypes to choose from for both the base and handset,0
3. cool design,0
4. 5.8 Ghz won't interfere with my wireless network,1
Things I didn't like:,1
No programmable voicemail button to press and call your voicemail to check messages.,1
2. No visible blinking light to notify new calls in the caller ID log.,1
Light only blinks when you have messages.,0
"3. If the handset says you have 3 new calls and you check them with the handset, the base still says you have 3 new calls.",0
Panasonic communicates with the base and resets the blinking light if you've checked your caller ID log from the handset.,0
I bought this phone because it had all the features I was looking for ( i.e.,0
"caller ID, 2.4 GHz range, speakerphone, etc. ).",0
Plus I've owned Uniden phones in the past and haven't had a problem with them.,1
"However, this phone has extremely poor sound quality from the handset.",0
It's very hard to hear/understand the person on the other end of the line ( even with the volume on high ).,0
What makes matters worse is that when you talk into the phone it sounds as if there is an echo which is very annoying.,0
"The bottom line is, this phone is going back to the store today",0
"this phone offers lots of fetures, but the quality seems poor. it also has alot of static.",0
the price of the phone was cheap but the buttons also seem cheap because they seem small.,0
other then that and if you stand on one leg and hold your head against a window it seems to work great.,0
We bought this phone to replace a cordless phone we had for about 9 years.,0
The phone we replaced was very cheap but worked perfectly for us until I dropped it into a bucket of water.,0
We looked around quite a bit at all the choices now available.,0
We like Panasonic products so decided to give this phone a try.,0
I wish you could try the phone out at the store because we never would have bought it.,1
The sound quality wasn't good at all for us.,1
"While talking, the phone was very echoey...people sounded like they were a million miles away.",0
"Thinking it might be our phone line, we took it to a friend's house and the same thing happened.",0
We returned it and got another one ( same phone ) just to give it another try.,0
Same problem.,0
"So, we ended up returning it and finding another model.",0
I've had the 2431 for 3 years.,0
I may have gotten 3 hours use from it.,0
It works fine for the first 5 or 10 minutes and that's when the volume fades.,0
Then it returns and then it fades again and doesn't stop.,1
Calling support was the fastest way to get the run-around that I've ever seen.,0
No help at all but they are willing to let you call back.,1
Still no help.,1
I packaged and mailed it back and after many weeks was sent a brand new replacement.,0
Same problem.,0
"I eliminated all environmental possibilities such as disconnecting other phones, computer, VCR, etc.",0
The problem still existed.,0
I've learned a $ 130 lesson,0
I bought this because my old Panasonic KX-TCM526BXB which was about 4 years old bit the dust.,0
I started buying cordless phones starting with the cheapest( then returning them and upgrading ) to this one which is the most expensive and none has a range of more than 30 yards.,1
My old panasonic used to go at least 50 yards.,0
"Also, it should be clearer but it isn't as I found a lot of interference, especially if you move more than 5 yards away from the base.",1
The only thing good about the product is it looks pretty,0
Pros: Great phone while it worked!,0
Cons: Should last more than three year.,0
Have had same problem with other Panasonic phones also.,0
After three years display on handset died.,0
Cannot recommend for durability an longevity.,1
I have had the same problem with other Panasonic phone systems before.,0
"They use to make the best, I will look at other brands in the future.",0
I purchased this phone with one KX-TGA271V accessory handset and one KX-TGA272S ( with the built-in clock ).,0
The standard handsets have very poor battery life but oddly the bigger clock-handset has very good battery life.,0
"Unfortunately, this is not a particularly comfortable phone to use and the ones that are comfortable discharge in a matter of minutes.",1
I followed the instructions for re-charging the batteries carefully and have replaced the batteries to no avail.,1
The feature set is fine but the the phone dies before you can get a chance to enjoy them.,0
They die without warning and it is a real nuisance.,1
"I intend to try the Energizer ER-P511 recommended in the review by jvas2, Dec 18'03 but I would think Panasonic could provide a workable battery with their product.",0
Pros: looks nice,0
"Cons: poor sound, cheap feel, died after 8 months",0
"This phone is all show no go, it looked good in the store, but is cheaply builts and has very poor sound qualit",1
"After just one year, displays in both handsets died.",0
"For the price, I expected decent quality.",0
Don't leave the phone off the handset charger for any length of time either--they go dead within one day.,1
Very bad performance!!,0
I purchased this phone about a year ago.,0
All the features that this phone offered ( along with it's price ) is what attracted me to this particular phone.,0
"I couldn't find anything that compared, however...I'm highly dissapointed in this Panasonic product.",0
"I've called Panasonic service, they attempted to help, but my receipt is long gone....so I'm out of luck.",0
"Since purchasing this phone, I've had problems with loosing ( or should I say ) fading conversations and clicking noises in the phone.",0
"I originally thought I had a phone line problem, but that wasn't the case.",1
Finally I thought that the phone was perhaps a lemon and I would try it again.,0
I went out and purchased the exact same phone just last week.,0
"Since purchasing the new one, I'm starting to notice the same problems.",0
It goes back to the store for a refund tomorrow and I'll try my luck with another brand.,0
"Great features and low cost is attractive, but it's not worth me having to wonder if Panasonic just isn't up to par when it comes to cordless phone technology.",1
My goal was to replace a 900Mhz Vtech cordless phone that we've had for several years and an old tape-based answering machine with a single device.,0
"My old cordless still works, but won't hold a charge well, so I was able to use it for sound quality comparisons.",0
I saw this phone with the two handsets for a good price and gave it a try.,0
"My findings seem to indicate that you simply cannot get the voice clarity and sound quality from ANY digital cordless that you can from an analog phone, period.",1
"I came to this conclusion after trying three other 2.4Ghz digital phones ( including this phone, another Panasonic, and a Motorola ) and comparing to my still-working old 900 Mhz cordless.",0
I finally found a 900 Mhz cordless with an answering system and finally foud one that sounded as good as my old phone.,0
"By the way, you can still find both 900Mhz Analog cordless phones and some 2.4 GHz ones as well.",0
Vtech has quite a few ( check www.vtechphones.com ).,0
"None of them have as many features as the digital phones though, which must by why they are now far more popular, despite the sound problems associated with digital.",1
"I'll admit, I didn't try any of the newer 5.8 GHz phones.",1
Maybe they do a better job with digital and can match the clarity of an analog phone.,0
"Now, that said, if you're willing to let sound quality suffer ( hey, it's a PHONE for goodness sake, why let SOUND suffer? ) and are set on a 2.4Ghz Digital cordless, Panasonic has a pretty good offering.",0
Here's what I liked about this one:,0
*/SYM Speakerphone on each handset - cool!,0
*/SYM The size and weight of the handset feel pretty good.,0
It's thinner and ligher that other phones.,0
My wife noticed that immediately and liked it,0
*/SYM directional selector button for navigating menus - very easy.,0
Although the menu system on this model is not as intuitive as the Panasonic KX-TG2248S.,1
I seem to remember having to go to an odd place to add an entry to the phone book.,0
*/SYM 2 handsets are included and you can buy a third,0
*/SYM there's a built-in answering system on the base,0
What I didn't like about this phone:,0
*/SYM It sounds bad at BOTH ends of the conversation.,0
At times it almost sounds like a 1/2 duplex speaker phone does.,0
"When you first go off-hook, you hear a solid hiss.",0
"The hiss goes down, although it does not disapper once you start dialing.",0
"The person we were calling to test it said that this phone gave a""tinny"" sound to the voice.",0
"Switching to our old 900Mhz cordless mid-call resolved it, ans switching back would bring it back.",0
So we know it's the phone.,0
*/SYM The antenna is too long.,0
This is true of all Panasonic phones.,0
"If you like to sit back in the recliner or easy chair, you have to keep your head turned so the antenna doesn't poke the back of the chair.",0
I don't know why Panasonic went with that design.,0
I think it makes the phones look less modern too.,0
*/SYM There's no MEMO button on the answering machine!,1
We use that all the time.,0
"I didn't think anyone even made an answering machine without one, so I never thought to look.",1
"In fact, it's the lack of this feature that made me set this phone aside to try the KX-TG2248S even though it only has one handset included.",0
*/SYM There's no phone/speakerphone on the base,1
Go back to analog if you're actually concerned with how your phone sounds!,0
"I finally ended up with a Radio Shack 900 MHz cordless that came with 2 handsets and an answering system in the base -- on sale for $ 45! There's no speakerphone on the handset or fancy features, and only one can be used at once, but at least it sounds as good as the phone I'm replacing and gets rid of my old nasty sounding tape-based answering machine",1
"Well, I went for the panasonic name coz I understand they make ( or was it made? )",0
good phones.,0
"After i returned my KXTG1871 since it started acting funny, i bought this one.",0
"Well, went on fine for a few months.",0
Now it has started acting funny.,0
"From the beginning, there is no low battery indicator when you talk. the phone just disconnects!! hey, even a 10 buck phone has the decency to beep before cutting your conversation!",1
The advantages were the NiMH battery since NiCd is a pain after it dies out pretty soon.,0
"I bought this coz it had two handsets, a speaker phone, caller id, a phone book in each handset, an answering machine.",0
"That reminds me, the answering machine can be accessed remotely but you cannot delete the messages unless you are at the machine!! hey, if i go on vacation, my voice box is full and even if i check messages, most of them were from crappy sales people selling timeshares, i cannot delete them missing out on any important messages that someone may want to leave!",1
"For that matter, you cannot delete messages after checking them from the handset.",1
"yeah, come back to the damn base unit.",0
Recently i've noticed that the sound is very choppy.,0
this is a sure let down coz i paid 170 for the thing and its now 50 bucks cheaper but still not worth it.,1
"I had a SONY some years back that was the basic cordless phone/answering machine unit you get. it had such good features that except for the caller id, it had many things that this""advanced"" device doesn't have.",0
I am seriously thinking whether Panasonic are serious about their phones any longer since this was my third Panasonic in two years.,0
UPDATE:,0
"Since you are reading this review, I figure you want all the goodies that this phone suggest.",0
May I suggest look for these too in addition?,0
1. Ringer delay.,0
This one shows the CID after 2-3 rings,0
2. Talk time.,0
This one is unpredictable.,0
I charged it over night yesterday and in the morning it went **** though the battery indicator shows full.,0
3. 3-way calling using the Phone book.,0
"This is tricky, coz after you place one call, you want to use the phone book in the same handset to dial another number for a conference call.",0
"well, you are out of luck with this one coz the phone book is not accessible.",1
even my junk nokia cellphone is good.,0
"4. If you move from one area code to another, do you have to edit all phone entries that were local in the former area code or does it automatically add the area code to those numbers?",0
My $ 7 Bell equipment caller id i bought 5 years ago does that!,0
"Smart, eh?",0
"5. I'd love to have a phone that uses the AA size NiMH since you can charge them separately and if the battery is to die out, put the call on hold at the base probably and change the batteries not missing your conversation.",1
6. Would love to have a base battery backup instead of hooking my phone to my pc's UPS in case we have power blackouts like the last one ( god forbid!! ),0
7. the ringer volume setting is cool though i'd prefer a switch instead of menu driven.,0
"8. I'd prefer if i program my base unit to forward calls when i want it to, to some number i specify (either in person or from remote location.",0
I could do that in my SONY ) instead of paying the phone company every month for a feature i use once or twice a year.,0
"9. I'd like a""backlight"" button instead of having to press any button to see how long i am talking or walk upto some light source if i am outside under the nice starry sky talking either to someone interesting or pretty boring.",0
Some phones say they are 2.4GHz but require you to switch frequencies.,0
Atleast this one doesn't require you to do so.,1
The fidelity is very good.,0
This was a concern (kinda picky ).,0
The expansion capacity is also a plus.,0
"Range ( roughly 100 yards + ) is what I would expect, with very little static.",0
"Attractive base unit with large display, easy to use.",0
"Intuitive..., well made.",0
Sorry if the above review sounds a little... guarded.,0
I've purchased several of these devices with a lot of disappointment.,0
But this one is really great!,0
The base unit is corded and the handset sounds like a corded phone.,0
"There are mailboxes ( 3 ) and a lots of utility regarding privacy, conference, transferring, caller id, call waiting, paging, and even radio contact between several handsets.",0
"For those with really young kids, there is a""baby monitor"" mode!",0
"In short, this is a nicely designed phone system with a lot of expansion, sounds great and is priced well.",0
"The Panasonic TGA230B is not only a great phone as a single unit, but when purchased in a set as can be done at Sam's Club, the phone is perfect for the home.",1
"With the 230, you get a built in, easy to use, and VERY CLEAR speakerphone, all part of the light weight handset that has an add-on belt attachment for easily keeping your phone with you.",0
A simple push of a button returns you to handset use.,0
"All controls, from the four way rocker switch conveniently placed under the viewscreen, to all of the feature buttons, are intelligently placed with functions identified on the button or adjacent to it on the faceplate.",0
The included product documentation is excellent.,0
The built in display is clear and easy to read.,0
There's a contrast adjustment to allow for lighter or darker letters and digits.,0
"Among the features are multiple ring tones, again very handy if you have multiple units and want to identify one of them for the kids.",0
The ringer loudness control permits turning the ringer off.,0
"When purchased as part of a system, you've got a home intercom.",0
"Any unit can page any other, and there are kits that include a console unit that contains a charger and a multifaceted digital answering machine.",0
"Up to three phones and the console can be part of the intercom system, thereby giving you four units.",0
"The digital answerer has built in answer greetings or you can record your own, and it it's necessary to dissuade solicitors at mealtimes, the recorder can deliver its greeting and hang up.",0
Caller-id and call waiting caller-id work with all phones.,0
The answer machine console lets you monitor the incoming message before choosing to take the call.,0
Durable?,0
"I accidentally dropped a phone about three feet to a concrete floor; no damage, the battery door opened and the battery fell out, no damage to the case whatever.",1
Additional features include battery life indicator and a charging system that will not allow overcharging the battery.,1
There are many good 2.4 Ghz phones.,0
"Our family has always been happy with Panasonic products, looks like our new phones are no exception...",1
"I was looking for a full-featured, multi-handset phone system for my house.",0
"I tried the 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz Vtecs, and while they had the best features, looks, and form factor, they had poor quality sound.",0
"When I buy a phone, I don't want hiss.",1
The Panasonics are as clean as a wire-connected phone.,0
The range is excellent.,0
"I've heard other people complain about the battery life, but I've not found this to be a problem.",1
You can have up to 8 handsets with this unit.,0
The answering machine can be controlled from the handsets.,0
"I wish the base unit had more buttons for controlling the answering machine, but since I mostly check from the handsets, this is not much of an issue.",1
I do wish the answering machine had more memory - it fills up a lot faster than my old answering machine.,0
"However, it warns you far in advance when it is getting low.",0
The base unit does lack an audio indicator when you have new messages.,0
"My old panasonic answering machine had this, and I miss it.",0
"As far as looks and form-factor: It's a silver/blue space age look, which is a little over-the-top for my tastes.",0
I wish they had a basic black or white.,0
I also wish the size of the phone were more along the lines of a cell phone.,0
"However, my wife disagrees with me on this, and likes a'full size' phone.",0
The hands-free speakerphone for the handsets is great.,0
I use it a lot more than I expected.,0
"This phone has a lot of features, which you can look up at the panasonic web site.",0
I highly recommend this phone.,0
I have had this phone for about a month now.,0
So far it has been a great quality piece of equipment.,0
"It sounds good, has long range, includes tons of features and is Wi-Fi friendly.",0
First the phone sounds great.,0
"It is crisp and clear, even at long distances.",0
It has speakerphone both on the handset and the base station which is clear for both myself and the people I talk to.,0
The handset has a'booster' feature that you can flip on when you start going out of range.,0
"It uses more battery power, but helps to keep your signal strong when far away.",0
The main reason I avoided 2.4 GHZ phones for so long was the interference with my Wi-Fi network.,0
There have been numerous stories where people have invested a couple hundred in a nice phone and then have to return it or throw it away because it shuts down their Wi-Fi.,0
I got this phone from my parents as a gift and tried it out right next to my wireless Powerbook.,0
I was able to talk on the phone and surf the net with no problems.,1
The powerbook still maintained full signal.,0
"This phone also sports a lot of features, maybe too many for some.",0
I am a gadget geek so I am enjoying it.,0
My favorite feature is the 3 mailboxes ( so my roommate and I can have separate boxes ).,0
You can also transfer a caller to voicemail instead of taking a message for the other person!,0
No more pads of paper next to the phone.,1
The major con to this phone is the total dependency on the handset.,0
"There is no intuitive LCD on the base station, just a number readout for the messages received.",1
You have to have the handset to do all programming and adjustments to the phones features.,0
"If it isnt charged, your out of luck.",0
"The address book is also hard to get to, you have to click the down arrow, then side arrow, and then scroll through the names.",0
It should be a single button click to get to the address book.,0
"Intro- If you're a regular reader of my reviews, you might recall that I reviewed another Panasonic cordless not long ago.",1
That unit was the KX-TG2215B.,0
I initially liked that particular phone ( Which I selected based upon my very limited needs in a cordless unit ).,0
"However, Within a month or so, I began to notice that the battery seemed to be dying much faster than it should have.",0
"Before long, I'd have to charge it 12 hours just to get a few minutes worth of talk time.",0
"In spite of the fact that the phone was fine for my need otherwise, it ended up getting only a two star rating from me in the end.",0
A phone with a dead battery is utterly useless.,0
I eventually got rid of that one and just went back to using my old corded phone.,0
"Being someone who really hates a lot of wires, I tired of the old corded phone rather quickly.",0
I knew it wasn't going to be long before I purchased another cordless but I decided that I wasn't going to get burned twice in less than a year so I just kept my eyes open for good deals.,1
"I really very rarely ever talk to anyone over the phone so I can't justify spending any more than I have to in order to get a good, reliable cordless with the features I need.",0
My goal was to find a unit for less than $ 50.,0
"My criteria - For a cordless phone to be useful to me, I had a pretty good idea of the features I wanted.",0
"Other than the battery issue, I was very happy with the features and performance of the other Panasonic.",0
My must-have features were as follows:,0
*/SYM Powered by a high capacity Ni-MH battery pack,0
*/SYM 2.4GHz,0
*/SYM Backlit Caller ID,0
"*/SYM Digital security ( I'm not really sure how"" secure"" the digital security touted on some of today's cordless units is, but it's comforting to at least feel like you're protected from eavesdropping and other people placing calls through your line )",0
*/SYM Decent sound quality,0
*/SYM I used to have a phone with a backlit keypad and found it to be a very handy feature.,0
I always keep my phone by my bed and I like to know that I don't have to turn on the lights to place a call.,0
"Battery concerns - Once I noticed the battery problem in the old phone, I did some checking around on Epinions and elsewhere and found that most Panasonic cordless units that used the old Ni-cad battery packs had the same problem.",0
"Therefore, I decided that if I was going to go with another Panasonic, I was going to make sure the unit was powered by a NI-MH ( Nickel Metal Hydride ) battery pack.",0
"Ni-cad batteries were always plagued by what is known as the""memory"" effect.",0
"Basically, what this boils down to is the batteries needed to be almost fully drained before recharging.",0
Continuously topping off Ni-cad batteries can sometimes cause their capacity to gradually decrease more and more until they're totally useless.,0
"At any rate, this problem has been discussed enough on the Internet and in complaints to Panasonic that I figured any new Panasonic with a Ni-MH pack would probably be free of this particular problem.",0
"As you'll see, it seems I guessed correctly.",0
The newer Ni-MH batteries also aren't totally immune to this issue but they are much less likely to suffer from this memory effect.,0
"At any rate, I'm still amazed that with so many more advanced battery technologies around, cordless phone manufacturers continue to use Ni-cads.",0
The newer batteries are starting to appear in more and more phones recently though.,0
"Shopping- When it comes to me and wires, there's only so much I can take before I finally get tired of fighting with them.",0
Going back to a corded phone wasn't as easy a transition as I thought it'd be.,1
"Finally, about a week ago, I set out to buy a new cordless.",0
I looked at a lot of models in almost every store I could think of that sells them.,0
I couldn't seem to find all of the features I wanted for the price I was willing to pay.,0
"It seemed if the phone had a decent battery pack and caller ID, it was either not a 2.4 GHz phone or it was well overy the $ 50 mark.",1
"Yes, I saw plenty of cheap cordless units without caller ID.",1
"However, I've gotten so used to it that I don't know how I ever lived without it.",1
I finally ( somehow ) ended up at Wal-Mart.,0
I really very rarely shop there but it was a last ditch effort before giving up and going home.,0
It was there that I finally selected my new phone - The Panasonic KX-TG2214W.,0
"Yes, the"" W"" in the model number stands for white.",0
"In general, I like all of my electronics to be black.",0
It never seems to go out of fashion and it always blends in nicely with all of my other black gadgets.,1
I was a little disheartened to find that this model was only being sold in white but this particular model has a couple of features that really set it apart from the rest of the sub $ 50 phones.,0
"For starters, it has a high capacity ( 1500 mAh)Ni-MH battery pack.",0
The feature that sent it over the top was the lighted keypad.,0
It's almost unheard of for a phone with these features to be less than $ 50!,0
"Initial impressions - Ok, I've been through this before.",0
This phone looks and feels a lot like the older Panasonic that I bought just a few short months ago.,0
I was surprised to find that the white doesn't bother me as much as I thought it might.,0
"You'd probably expect any product made by such a reputable manufacturer as Panasonic would have a nice, solid look and feel and this unit is no exception.",1
It has absolutely no sloppy gaps anywhere that I can find.,1
"The layout of the keypad and caller ID is pretty nicely done, although I miss the old navigator key.",0
There's still a navigator key but it's not a four-way key like the one on the older units.,1
"Still, navigating through the menus and doing everything you need to do to set up the phone is all easy enough to learn once you read the manual ( And maybe even if you don't ).",0
"As it was with the older Panasonic, the Backlit caller ID has excellent contrast and is large enough to be read at a comfortable distance.",0
The keypad lights up whenever you hit buttons and when the phone rings.,0
"Oddly, there's no way to turn this feature off in the menu if you want to conserve power.",1
"I guess it's not a huge deal anyway, since the battery pack is listed a being good for over five hours of talk time and 14 days in standby.",1
Some of the features that are touted on this phone are:,0
*Voice Enhancer Technology- I haven't got a clue how this works but it does.,0
"As long as you don't turn the handset volume up to max, it has an overall pleasing effect.",0
Voices do sound more natural than on Panasonic's older 2.4 GHz units without this technology.,1
"Still, it's kind of gimmicky and you have to wonder why a company like Panasonic would need to""enhance"" the clarity of the call when last year's models were supposed to be so great ( According to their own packaging last year ).",0
"Backlit 3-line LCD - Frankly, I liked the display on the old phone slightly better.",0
"When this phone rings, if you have name and number caller ID service, it displays only the name first.",0
"This might seem a convenience but it doesn't help much when your caller ID service lists all cellular calls as"" Cellular call"".",1
"Of course, it eventually alternates and shows you the actual number but it takes a few seconds, valuable time when you're trying to decide whether or not to answer a call.",1
"The old phone, if I remember correctly, displayed both the name and the number in the same frame.",0
That's about the only gripe I have with the LCD.,0
"Otherwise, the text is clear and legible and as I mentioned, contrast is excellent ( and also adjustable if you don't like the default setting ).",1
This phone also has a 30 number memory for the caller ID and the ability to store 50 names and numbers ( Far more than I'll ever need ).,0
Ultra charge - It's nice to see that cordless manufacturers are finally taking notice of people's desperate pleas to shorten the length of time it takes to recharge the battery packs in their phones.,0
"On top of the incredible 14 day standby time for this battery pack, it will take a full charge in six hours.",0
This is a vast improvement but I guess these manufacturers expect us to forget that we're living in a world where you can charge your cell battery pack in three hours and keep a spare charged up and ready to go.,0
It's also the same world in which I can fully charge two AA Ni-MH cells for my digital camera in about an hour.,0
I guess it all boils down to cost.,0
Cordless phones already cost more than they should and I guess these companies are just happy that people buy them at all.,0
How does this phone sound?,0
"Well, I don't require audiophile sound from my telephones.",0
"If I can hear and understand what the person on the other end is saying and they can hear and understand me, I'm satisfied.",0
"Naturally, I'm not a big fan of static.",1
So far all of the calls I've made on this phone have been clear and relatively static free.,0
"It makes me wonder when I hear persistent complaints about static and""horrible audio quality"" with very similar phones in Panasonic's lineup.",0
"Maybe I'm just not as picky as some folks, who knows? ( Update: 12/04/03 ) As I've used the phone more in recent days, I have indeed noticed a slight""echo"" in the sound.",1
"Basically, you can kind of hear your own voice in a delayed sort of way after you speak.",0
It's not really bad though and doesn't really affect my overall impression or rating of the phone.,1
The only time when I noticed a really procounced form of this echo was when someone else in my house was on the other line at the same time.,0
The Speakerphone - Panasonic seems to be one of the few manufacturers that builds speakerphones into their handsets and sells them for a reasonable price.,0
The speakerphone on this one does what it's supposed to.,0
"I haven't used it much but when I have, it's given me the ability to talk hands free.",1
The sound comes out of the speaker on the rear of the handset loud and clear.,0
Is the battery issue resolved?,0
"Yes, I believe so.",0
I haven't encountered any of the problems that I had with the old phone in this unit.,1
"So far, both talk and standby times have been great!",0
Do I recommend this phone?,0
"Yes, with a slight reservation.",0
"If you demand absolute perfection in a cordless unit, you're almost certainly going to be spending far more than the $ 49.95 that I paid for this.",0
This unit isn't perfect and has some limitations.,0
I haven't tested the range but it works great in my apartment.,0
That's all the range I need.,0
"If you need more range, judging from some of the other reviews I've read about Panasonic's Gigarange line, you might want to look elsewhere.",0
My needs are very basic and this unit has features that I may not ever use.,1
"I haven't listed them all, as this review is already running long.",1
"We used to own a Siemens 2415, a predecessor to the 4215.",0
"The 2415 phone was great, but failed the drop and bounce test, we needed a new phone.",0
"We actually bought an ATandT 2.4Ghz phone first, assuming that the clarity of the calls we got with the 2415 was to do with the digital transmission on that frequency rather than something specific about the phone.",0
"That was a mistake, the ATandT calls were simply not that clear and the range of the phone was not as good as the 2415.",1
We returned the ATandT phone and bought a 4215 ( and another 4215 handset ).,0
This is a great phone.,0
For us the major issue with a phone more than features is the clarity of the calls and with the 4215 ( even in speakerphone mode ) it is exceptional.,0
"We did find you need to read the manual to learn how to use all of the features correctly, but the on-screen LCD prompts you for most things.",0
Range is great.,0
"With the base station at the rear of our house, we can use the phone with no loss of clarity outside at the front of our house, over 60 feet away.",1
I am sure it would go father but we do not have that need.,1
"In case anyway reading this is not aware, getting a 2.4Ghz or 5.8Ghz digital cordless is very different to getting an analog cordless phone.",1
Analog phone call quality is typically poorer and will degrade the further away from the base station you get.,0
You may also notice they have more visible antenna on both the base and the phone.,0
The other often missed difference is the security of your calls.,0
Its just too easy to receive analog telephone calls using something as cheap as a baby monitor!,0
You would not be able to listen into a digital cordless transmission as easily.,1
"The phone is packed with all the features you would expect, directory, caller id display and so on.",0
The answer machine does everything you could want including remote access.,0
"A small gripe would be that it comes with Ni-Cd rechargeable batteries and I would have preferred Ni-MH as these do not have the memory effect of Ni-Cd, however as the batteries are standard size AA rechargables you can replace them very easily with Ni-MH when the Ni-Cds give up.",1
One final cool feature is the voice activated dialing.,0
"Available on some cellular wireless phone for sometime now, the 4215 allows you to pick directory entries simply by speaking the persons name.",0
"As you can guess, I love this phone.",0
Pros: Easy set up/great features / understandable instructions / user friendly.,0
"Cons: Could have made the handset with a more comfortable, less irritating design for ear area.",0
Instructions are clear and the phone is easy to set up.,0
The features are incredible.,0
The fact that you can have extension phones all over the house is amazing.,0
"The phone book, once set up in any unit can be copied to all other phones.",0
"You can use the phone to page another phone, transfer a call, conference, or use like an intercom.",0
"It has a room monitoring feature, like for a baby's room, or if you were caring for someone who was really sick.",0
The distance from home with good reception is about 1000 feet.,0
There is a booster feature available but I have not tried it all the way to the hunting shack ( reason I chose 5.8 gh ).,1
"You don't have to use the""answering machine"".",0
"If you don't press the"" Answer On"" button, which is indicated by a red light, you will have a plain old regular phone.",1
I am a little dismayed that the answering machine will only hold 15 minutes of calls.,0
I'll have to remember to clear it more often.,0
The phone works great once you make adjustments in the setting up of the phone.,0
It's fun to use.,0
"We needed more cordless handsets, and add caller ID to our phone functionality.",0
"We are extremely happy with the sound clarity, reception, functionality, expandability, and value of this system.",0
We already own another 2.4GHz Panasonic cordless phone and we love it so we decided to stick with Panasonic and the 2.4GHz line:,0
http://www.epinions.com/elec-review-7DE9-27970EB-394FC57C-prod2,0
"While at Fry's ( to my surprise ), a sales associate actually helped us.",0
"I told her what I was looking at ( I was already holding a single Panasonic 2.4GHz unit ) when she ( to her credit ) showed us this model; which is the same technology, but has 2 handsets with one single basestation.",0
"That means that there is only one unit to plug to the phone jack, which both the handsets utilize.",0
The other minibase is just a charging station.,0
This allows you to put the other unit's minibase anywhere in the house near a power outlet ( much more common than a phone jack ).,0
"Plus, in the future we can add a 3rd handset and all 3 would still utilize the single main basestation.",0
"Each unit can intercom to each other, and all have caller ID using the crystal clear clarity of Panasonic's 2.4GHz.",0
All of this for under $ 100.,0
PHYSICAL FEATURES,0
The base station is reasonably small and has a telephone jack and wall-wort AC adaptor for power.,0
It is approximately 2 handsets in size and it allows you to place one handset (either one ) either face down or face up ( latter allows you to see caller ID without picking it up first ).,1
There are 3 intercom buttons which allow you to locate and intercom to any of the handset units.,0
A single antenna is used to transmit/receive with the handsets.,0
It's all enclosed in a clean white plastic casing.,0
The handsets are like long bars of soap and are easy to hold.,0
A rigid 3 inch antenna sticks out at the top and for the most part doesn't manage to get in the way.,1
An optional belt clip can be attached the the back of the phone and there is an mic/earphone jack for hands-free headsets ( which works well ).,0
"The buttons are reasonably laid out, but they are a little small for aging eyes ( over 60 ) to see.",0
"The OFF and CALL buttons, the most commonly pressed buttons ( think END and SEND on your cell phone ) are curiously smaller than the number pad, which makes it a short hunt for people unfamiliar with the unit to find... ie guests.",0
The screen is green back lit LCD display which is easy to read.,0
RECEPTION,0
"I was a little concerned that the basestation only has 1 antenna, compared to our older Panasonic 2.4GHz unit which has 2 antenna for diversity ( more immune to""pockets"" of bad reception ).",0
"However, in practice I have found that these units have extremely good reception and have yet to experience the pockets of bad reception anywhere in the house or garage.",0
The range easily covers our entire home property.,0
"I should also mention that in addition to our other 2.4GHz phone, we also have a 802.11b wireless network in our house ( which also uses the 2.4GHz spectrum ).",0
"We have never experienced any interference on the phone by the other devices, and we haven't noticed interference with our network.",1
CALLER ID AND OPERATION,0
"The phones are easy to use and bring a more""cell phone like"" functionality to the home phone.",0
"As calls come in, the phone performs caller ID.",0
"It takes till the 2nd ring to figure out the number, but I think this is typical.",0
"If you have previously saved the number and labelled it, then that text label will also show up with the number.",0
"Because the display has 2 lines, it's really nice to see both the number and the label at the same time.",0
"You can either push the CALL button for a dial tone and dial the desired number as a regular phone, or you can predial the number ( which means you can also backspace if you err ) and then press CALL ( like a cell phone ).",0
"All the standard functions like redial, flash, and constant button tones are all there.",0
"As mentioned above, there is a phone number directory which allows you to enter or save caller ID numbers with labels ( ie"" Grandma"" ) to a phone directory.",0
Manipulating the menu can be a little confusing and counter intuitive; this part could stand for improvement.,0
"However, the most annoying thing is that each hand set maintains it's own directory, which means you have to enter each entry twice; once for each phone, for both phones to have it.",0
There is no directory synchronization feature.,1
Panasonic should really consider adding this functionality.,0
It's not convenient to spontaneously add the caller ID received phone call to both directories.,1
"Not a show stopper, but it's something to be improved in future models.",1
"Each handset also has speaker phone capability, a wonderful feature for a handset.",0
An extra speaker on the back of the phone serves as the loud speaker.,0
Battery is a rechargeable NiCd which easily last several days.,0
SUMMARY,0
"Combine the clarity of 2.4GHz, the ease of a single basestation and remote charging station, caller ID, speaker phone, good battery life, and quality construction; these phones are easily the most used phones in our home.",0
"Set at a very reasonable price point ( for quality ), I can recommend this set to any body without hesitation.",1
Our Sony phones died after 7 years...which I don't think is too bad for a cordless phone.,1
"We wanted something less bulky, clear sound and easy to operate.",0
"My husband hates talking on the phone, so I had to find something light-weight and comfortable.",0
This phone has it all!,0
"2.4G is great for the country, and no problems near the microwave.",1
Lighted key pad helps in low light times.,0
"You can choose from 6 different ring tones, but it had no""regular"" phone ring, these are all very electronic sounding.",1
The intercom comes in handy when I'm upstairs and he is downstairs.,0
"And, having an extra handset with no need for a phone jack saved us some""renovations""",1
I have had the Panasonic 2 line system since last November and I really enjoy its feautres.,0
Even some companies fail to offer the features of this phone.,0
Here is my own review from personal everyday use.,0
I won't explain the answering machine in detail as it is a straight forward easy to use machine with 5 greetings and ring selections (2-7 ).,1
Answering Machine secret: There is a secret that I found out when I was playing around with the system seeing which settings I like.,0
On the answering system you can set up the main message and direct callers to different voicemail extensions.,0
It works like the automated attendant system so I don't see why Panasonic added this feature to the system.,1
Any idea?,0
Automated Attendant System:,0
This system has 5 greetings on two lines.,0
You can program the same greeting on both lines.,0
"For the pre-recorded greeting it is a bland lady saying"" Automated Attendent System please enter the extension you wish to reach"".",0
Change this before you play around with the settings.,0
"I love being able to call my house and press the extension number followed by the pound sign and it says"" Please wait a moment"".",0
"It can also say"" Sorry this line is busy"" when someone is on their extension and it lets you leave a message following the incomplete call handilng menu which is simple to use.",0
"It can even say"" Sorry there is no space for recording"" when your mailbox is full.",1
It will let you loop-back to the main greeting by pressing 2. No more hang-ups.,1
Now let me tell you you can not program the greetings for the time of day.,1
So lets say you are working at a company the receptionist will have to manually change the greetings.,0
It also has no dial-by-name directory found on PBX only systems.,1
Voicemail:If you want your phone to go into voicemail after 2 rings it can.,0
This feature is called forward no answer like on company phones if you don't pick up after 2 rings it will go right into your voicemail and your personal greeting will play.,1
If you have this feature turned off in the menu on your handset then it will ring 5 times and play the generic greeting which is ok but don't you want your own greeting?,0
You have the option of 50 minutes or 100 minutes of recording time including the Automated Attendant greetings.,0
I have never used up all the time even with all the messsages our household gets.,1
You can easily access your messages while you are away from your desk by calling in the main number and pressing */SYM then your 4 digit passcode.,0
Another Voicemail secret:,0
If you need to check the receptionist mailbox( Reffered to as The General Delivery Mailbox ) you can press 4 then after the messages are heard then press 4 again and it will get you back to your mailbox.,0
Everything is a single call operation on this system.,0
Voicemail/system cons: I don't like that the General Delivery Mailbox only has the generic greeting.,0
I like to be able to say ( Were sorry there is no receptionist available please leave a message.,1
Also there is no quick messaging by pressing ** twice and having it say enter the destination for your message.,1
This can only be done if you are logged into your mailbox.,0
Also having to press # /# to get an extension is a minor con.,0
There is no automatic transfer to the receptionist if no action is taken.,1
"At some companies it will say"" Invalid entry transferring to an attendant one moment please"".",0
Operator Counsle: The main unit with the operator rings 5 times you got that right then it plays a generic greeting.,0
Also if you are on a rotary dial phone you have to wait for the main greeting to play 3 times it is good for tone users and bad for other rotary users.,0
No Dial By Name Directory:,1
This needs to be added because it is easier for people to get into extensions.,0
For instance it could say to dial by name press 411 then the caller would be insturcted from there.,0
Handset Registration:,0
Oh my!,0
You have to buy a handset for each extension.,0
"There is no way of saving money by just having a""guest mailbox"" where it goes right to voicemail wihtout rining the extension.",1
Oh well.,0
Name Directory:,0
You can store a lot of your friends names and numbers in the phonebook directory.,0
A good feature for all of us.,0
Caller ID:,0
I don't use this feature but the manual says that it will tell how many times a caller called.,0
I can go on and on on this phone system.,0
If you want to discuss this system please email me at vipclub@msn.com.,0
"If there is any professionals out there I would like to discuss voicemail systems( Nortel, Toshiba Panasonic etc ) as this is my hobby and a possible career.",0
Our 15 year old cassette-tape answering machine died.,0
Our upstairs cordless phone was near death.,0
Time to go phone shopping.,0
I was attracted to idea of the new expandable cordless phone systems... the kind with a single base station and the ability to add several handsets.,0
The many benefits of such systems include the ability to use the handset and base stations as intercoms and the ability to transfer calls from one handset to another.,0
Those items are just the beginning of the long list of cool features of the Panasonic KX-TG5110M.,0
There are two ways you can buy this phone system.,0
The first is as a package with the base station and one handset ( Model KX-TG5100M).,0
This sells for around $ 200.,0
"You can also buy a package that contains the base station and TWO handsets ( Model KX-TG5110M), which you can usually find for around $ 265.",0
"This is a good deal, because the individual handsets sell for $ 79-89 each.",0
"If you know you need more than one handset, definitely try to find the two-handset package, and save yourself a few bucks.",0
"When I was buying, neither Circuit City nor Best Buy carried the two-handset package.",1
Sears and Amazon.com,0
did.,0
I bought mine from Amazon.com.,0
THE TECHNICAL STUFF,0
This phone system works in the new 5.8 GHz frequency range.,0
The advantage of this over the more common 2.4 GHz phones is that the latter is more prone to interference from microwave ovens.,0
"Also, if you have an 802.11b wireless computer network in your house or building, that works on the 2.4 GHz frequency range, it could cause interference with that kind of phone system.",0
"This Panasonic system uses digital spread-spectrum technology, which constantly and automatically searches for the clearest channels in the band to give interference-free performance.",0
"In my experience, it works flawlessly...",0
This phone really sounds exactly like a good corded phone.,0
"At my house, the range is about the same as what I got with my previous 900 MHz phone.",0
"I can go outside on the front porch, but if I venture about 30 feet down the driveway, the reception goes away quickly.",0
"Inside the house, there are no dead spots, and reception is flawless, both upstairs and downstairs.",1
THE BASE STATION,0
"The base station is a sleek, attractive compact unit with a large LCD screen that displays its many functions.",0
"Unlike Panasonic's 2.4 GHz models, which come in gaudy shades of purple and silver, these phones have an attractive, businesslike platinum color.",0
"The LCD screen displays caller ID info, your phone book, which can store up to 50 numbers, the interface for the digital answering system, and the menus that you use to set up the phone's features.",0
"The display is backlit, large, with nice big readable text.",0
"There is a large circular, 4-way rocking navigation control which allows you to scroll through your phone book, caller ID list, as well as menus.",0
It also acts as the base station's volume control.,0
The base station can be used stand-alone as a speakerphone if there is no handset handy.,1
HANDSETS,0
The KX-TG5110M system can handle up to eight handsets.,0
"Each handset has a small LCD screen, with 3 soft key buttons that perform various functions, labeled on the screen.",0
"Even though the screen is smaller, and the handset contains fewer buttons, you can perform nearly all of the functions on the handset that you can on the base station.",0
"Most of the buttons on the handset are backlit, and light up when you touch any button.",0
"MINOR GRIPE # 1: For some reason, Panasonic did not backlight the four most important buttons ( Talk, Speakerphone, Off, and Hold ).",1
"The handsets are solidly built, and feel good in your hand.",0
"They are a little larger than those on some of the competing phones, but I'm not bothered by that.",1
"The buttons have good feel, and a quiet beep gives you good feedback with each press.",0
"The center of the handset has a rocking joystick-like navigation control, which performs the same functions as the big one on the base station.",0
"In fact, the really nice thing about this system is that the handsets operate like minature versions of the base station.",0
"MINOR GRIPE # 2: For some reason Panasonic labeled some of the buttons with slightly different names... for example on the base station there is a button labeled"" Hold/Clear"".",0
"There is an equivalent button on the handset, but it's called"" Erase"".",0
"They both do the same thing, but they have different names.",0
Needless confusion.,0
Handsets come with their own speakerphones.,0
The speaker is in the back of the handset.,0
"It is not really loud, but it does work, and it beats holding the phone to your ear while you're on hold for 45 minutes.",1
"Headset fans can plug in to a jack on the side, and use the included belt clip.",0
Each handset is an intercom that can call any or all of the other handsets or the base station.,0
"If you answer an outside call, and you want to transfer the call to another handset, it's really easy to do so.",0
"The base station has a handset locator button, so you can find that handset that got buried under the dirty laundry.",0
It is possible to use up to 4 handsets and the base station simultaneously in a conference call.,0
"A handset can also be used as a baby monitor, but I would guess that that would eat up your battery pretty quickly.",0
One really cool feature is that you can transfer an entire phone book list or an individual phone book entry from any handset or the base station to any other handset.,0
"MAJOR COMPLAINT # 1: Panasonic decided to use NiCad handset batteries with this phone, instead of the much superior NiMH batteries.",0
"Many reviewers had complaints about poor battery life, and charging memory problems with Panasonic's 2.4GHz line, and this new model was an opportunity for them to fix that by using better batteries.",0
"I've seen reviews elsewhere that say that the batteries do work better on these phones, but time will tell.",0
"The handset also has a signal booster mode, which you can turn on when reception becomes iffy.",0
"It give you a little more range, but it also cuts down on your battery life.",0
THE ANSWERING SYSTEM,0
"The base station contains a digital answering system that supports an outgoing message of up to 3 minutes, and 15 minutes of message recording time, all digitally recorded.",0
"The sound quality isn't as good as your CD player, but it's not bad.",1
"The system has three separate voice-mail boxes ( which is perfect at our house, because there are three of us ).",0
"You can use your outgoing message to instruct callers to hit pound-1 to talk to Dad, pound-2 to talk to Mom, etc..",0
"If you don't need separate voicemail boxes, you are not forced to use them.",1
Messages for any of the mailboxes can be retrieved at the base station or on any of the handsets.,0
A flashing indicator on the LCD lets you know which mailboxes contain fresh messages.,0
All messages have a time/date stamp.,0
There is an option for slowing down the playback of messages.,0
"The system uses flash memory, so if the power goes out, you don't lose your messages.",1
"The answering system works just the way you'd expect it to, and it's very intuitive to use.",0
CONCLUSIONS,0
I thought long and hard before spending this kind of dough on a phone.,0
"But when you balance that high price against the long list of great features that you can use every day, along with excellent build quality, great sound, good looks, ease of use, the Panasonic KX-TG5110M becomes a solid choice.",0
"I compared it to the even more expensive Siemens systems, and found it to be a better choice.",0
"After using it for a few weeks, I don't regret the purchase at all.",1
"Now, I've just got to keep filling the swearing jar, so I can get a few more handsets for around the house.",0
I recently had to replace my office phone system to eliminate a barely functional Siemens multi-line phone.,0
I also needed a new answering system.,0
Our office has gone through a number of answering systems over the years.,0
All have left something to desire.,0
After reading reviews here at Epinions we decided to change to the Panasonic KX-TG2000B.,0
"The base unit is well constructed and has a very large and useful LCD display, which is a nice change of pace from the Lilliputian LC D's found on most phones.",0
The base unit has a corded handset and offers a jack for headset use.,0
"A very nice addition is a"" Headset"" button, which is used to answer calls when then headset is in use.",0
Finally a manufacture understands how a headset is actually used.,0
The headset can be programmed with both speed dial and directory listings.,0
One draw back here is that the handsets do not share the base station directories.,1
You must program the handsets individually.,0
Setup of the base unit is simple and is achieved by a few well marked buttons in conjunction with the LCD display.,0
"The answering system and"" Auto Attendant"" functions are a little confusing.",0
The answering machine function can be turned on to answer calls on either phone line and offers one general voice mail delivery box.,0
"The"" Auto Attendant"" feature however can route calls to individual handsets on answering the phone.",0
This function offers a separate voice mail box for each handset used.,0
This is a draw back as you can not use multiple mailboxes in the answer mode.,1
We would have liked to use several mailboxes to announce address and appointment information.,0
This is however not possible.,1
"We do not use the""auto Attendant"" feature, but it may be useful in a larger office with no receptionist to field calls.",1
The answering system is efficient and fast.,0
The electronic voice is a pleasant female voice which announces mailbox activity.,0
New messages are easily spotted as the voice mail button is a large clear button which flashes a red icon when a new message is taken.,0
The voice is fast and does not slow down the user.,1
A pleasant treat for anyone who has labored to listen to the slow banter of other voice mail systems.,0
The handsets are well constructed and have a solid heavy feel.,0
Buttons are well marked and the LCD display and keypad light up on use.,0
Sound quality is exceptional with little discernable difference between the handsets and a corded phone.,0
Truly first class sound.,0
Transferring calls from one phone to the next is a bit of a task.,0
We have placed small notes on the phones with instructions on how to transfer.,0
After a few more weeks we will have learned the system and then be able to remove the notes.,0
I feel that the KX-TG2000B has given us a far more reliable phone and answering solution.,0
There is a serious lack of high quality phones and answering systems on the market.,0
The Panasonic KX-TG2000B is thankfully not one of these poor quality contenders.,1
It is a first class product with few weaknesses.,0
For the price it is a steal.,0
I wish I had bought one long ago!,0
I have been looking for a good business phone that has enough features and with good sound quality.,0
This model is an excellent home-office tool.,0
Perhaps I am not using it as most people would use it.,1
I have a second line wired to my office only so expanding it elsewhere in the house won't be necessary.,0
I may add a cordless unit for downstairs in case I'm there or when I have small meetings in my living room.,0
Then I'll treat it as an extension line.,0
But the fact that I have the ability to walk in and around the house with the 2.4GHz phone and never miss a call is great.,1
"Every other phone in the house is a regular 900Mhz or a corded phone, so nobody can mistakenly answer my business line.",0
The unit is rich with features and is easy to setup with the LDC screen.,0
The voice-mail system is very good too.,0
"The digitized voice is pleasant to hear, an upgrade from Panasonic's previous answering machines with robot-sounding prompts.",0
"I don't use the answering system for the business line, however.",1
"I subscribe to PacBell's message center so that in case I am on the phone, the line could still take a message.",0
Otherwise it would ring and ring with call waiting.,0
I also like the slanted look of the phone.,0
There's the psychological effect of using the base unit with the attached headset- sort of a power trip...,0
But Panasonic overlooked a big feature: The Mute Button.,0
"On conference calls I have to remain pretty quiet, or use the conferecing system's own mute feature.",0
This is one of the biggest flaws I see on the unit.,0
"I'm going to Radio Shack to see if I could find some kind of""muteable"" headset adapter.",0
"If that exists, problem solved.",0
I would highly recommend this phone.,0
"Panasonic, in my opinion makes the best phones out there.",0
I've virtually owned almost every other cordless unit out there.,0
This one is a keeper.,0
It seems that every year I buy 3-4 cordless phones because the last years begin to die.,0
"So, this time I decided that I needed to buy better phones.",0
"I tried the Siemens Gigaset phone, but it wasn't so good ( see my opinion on that... )",0
The Panasonic is pretty neat - I have 3 cordless handsets in addition to the base station ( base comes with one cordless ).,0
The individual phones were a problem for me because I would regularly put the phone in the wrong base station; some of the cordless phones out there aren't real tolerant of that.,0
"The Panasonic just has chargers, which is great!",0
"I now have phones on every floor of the house, all tied together.",0
"It also has an auto-attendant and up to 8 voicemail boxes, which is really nice for small businesses.",0
I would recommend getting the second line if you don't have one yet.,1
I'm still using it with a single line.,0
"The voice quality is wonderful, even at a good distance ( 100 ft or more ), through walls, etc.",0
Even the speakerphone ( in the base station ) works well.,0
"My one complaint ( which I think applies to all 2.4Ghz phones ) is that when I use my microwave, it garbles the reception on the phone.",0
"Mostly, it sounds like you're under water.",0
"Oh - one last thing - once a call is answered by a handset, you can't just turn on another handset and join in.",0
"It works like a PBX system, where the handsets have their own extension number ( they can all answer incoming calls, though ).",0
"So, to have more than one handset on the same line at the same time, you have to""intercom"" to the other handset, and"" conference"" the call.",0
"Again, good for businesses, not so great for my home use.",1
"It's liveable, though.",0
"I have a home office and three kids ( 11, 13 and 15 years old ) and this phone system is awesome!",0
We've been using it for about 9 months now.,0
The kids phones are set to not ring when the business line rings so they don't answer my business calls.,1
I also have my business line set for a different sound when it rings.,0
The kids cannot pick up my business line while I am on it.,1
"I have programmed all of my handsets to NOT answer when the phone is lifted out of the charger, I can pick up the phone to see who is calling and decide whether or not to answer the call.",1
"We can all communicate with eachother throughout the house with the phones, which is great when the kids are sick.",0
"It only took a couple of days to get used to which phone is in which room ( ie phone # 1 is in the office, phone # 2 is in the family room etc. )",0
"It is so easy to transfer calls to eachother, we do it all the time.",0
"It doesn't have a mute button but it does have a hold button, which is even better.",0
When a call comes in you can save the caller ID info directly into your phone.,0
You can edit your Directory List info if necessary.,0
The kids had no trouble learning how to use it.,1
They each have their own friends' numbers saved in their own phones and I have mine.,0
The caller ID and the Directory List are so easy to use.,0
"The battery lasts for days, for those times when we forget to put them back in the charger at night.",0
I purchased a headset and we have all used it at different times and are very happy with it.,0
"I wasn't sure this phone system would work the way that I had hoped, it was expensive, but I took a chance and it does everything ( and more ) that I had hoped!",0
"I hope they come out with a 2-line version, but that would be a different review.",0
I had my doubts about getting this phone.,0
You'll find several negative reviews from other consumers.,0
Most of them complain about poor range or clarity.,0
I'm glad to say that I haven't experienced either of these issues.,1
"In fact, the phone is so clear that people on the other end of the line don't know I'm using a cordless phone.",1
"As far as range goes, I live in a decent size house on a 1/4 acre lot.",0
"So long as I can make it to the mailbox or yard while on the phone, I'm happy.",0
"Yes, I've gone further.",0
"No, I haven't test the limits.",1
"Anyway, this phone's base and handset transmit on the 5.8 ghz band, unlike other 5.8 phones with handsets that return a 2.4 ghz signal.",0
I'm on a wireless network and use VPN secured access when working.,0
"I had to get this phone, because my older 2.4 ghz phone kept causing my secure link to hiccup ( which it doesn't like ), forcing me to continually log on with my secureid pin.",1
Damn telemarketers!,0
This phone has all of the features you'd expect from a high end phone.,0
The cake topper is the speakerphone built into each handset.,0
Then there's the ability to transfer calls.,0
"Let's say your in the garage and you answer the phone, but it's actually for your wife.",0
No problem.,1
Just hit the transfer button and the 2nd unit rings until she picks it up.,0
"As far as simplicity goes, the menu/button structure isn't terribly difficult to figure out.",0
"If you can store a number on your cell phone, this will be a breeze.",0
Final note: These are expensive phones.,0
"If you have a wireless network and don't want t flip the bill for 5.8, there's always good ole 900 mhz.",1
"Wanted a 5.8 ghz phone to replace a 900 mhz model, skipped 2.4 ghz range to avoid interference with in home wi-fi set up.",0
Also wanted Caller ID but did not need digital answering feature since we have SBC Voice mail.,1
This was a second choice which I selected after buying and returning Vtech 5831 ( see separate review ).,0
Now that I have this phone I can recommend it.,0
The phone has a nice amber backlit LCD.,0
Not as many pixels as the Vtech model but quite readable.,1
Large talk button with smaller function buttons arrayed around it requires a little practice but a well written manual comes with the package and we've quickly learned to use it.,0
Sound quality is excellent and it is true 5.8 ghz both ways between base unit and handsets.,0
The package comes with 2 handsets -- and 2 chargers -- a real plus.,0
All the other packages provide one handset and want to sell you additional handsets.,0
"I am not sure if you can add more handsets to this setup, but having 2 out of the box is a very good deal.",1
"C'mon, unless you live in a mansion, how many handsets do you really need?",0
The only thing that I don't like about this product is that each handset is an island unto itself; there is no way to synchronize the address books between handsets.,1
So you have to create each address book separately.,0
"To be fair, I am not sure that any other cordless phone offers the kind of""address book synchronization"" I am complaining about, so this may be more of a personal gripe.",0
"Still, my wife and I beam address book data between our PDA's, so this is not exactly a cutting edge technology.",1
Maybe someday they will include IR beaming between the handsets.,0
"Until that day comes, this is still a very good buy.",0
"The phone works, sounds great, is true 5.8 ghz, is easy to program, and you get 2 handsets in the box.",0
Highly recommended.,0
I do not review the answering machine feature because we have voice mail through our Telco and do not need it.,1
This phone is totally solid on all of the features it touts.,0
Sound Quality- Great!,0
I haven't had any problems with interference like phizzes or pops.,0
Most useful features:,0
Speakerphone in handsets as well as base.,0
I use it all the time for checking our voicemail.,0
"Phone Book sharing: Add all your contacts into one handset, then"" copy"" them to all the other handsets/base.",0
Ability to be using all the handsets at the same time: Do not be fooled by other 5.8 Ghz phones.,1
Some of them ( Uniden ) do not actually allow both handsets to be used simultaneously.,1
This one does.,0
"But, it also allows you to set a""privacy"" feature before you place a call so that the other handset cannot be used to hear your call.",1
Intercom feature: Allows you to talk to the other handset or base while offline ( not on a telephone call ).,1
"Plus, you can choose to call a specific handset ( like an extension ) or all of them at once.",0
Key Navigation: I was very pleased with the layout of the keys which allowed for easy navigation and addition of contacts.,0
"Battery Strength indicator: This seems like a no-brainer for all cordless phones, but this is the first one I have seen that actually has it!",0
Thank you Panasonic!,0
"Previous phones made me dash to a corded phone when the beeps went off, indicating that it was dying....NOW.",0
The selectable ring tones are nice.,0
You can choose from JARRING to sooothing.,0
And in between of course.,0
Ergonomics: Good.,0
"Nothing gets in the way ( like chin next to the""off"" button ) Easy to hold.",0
Belt clips were sort of a struggle to install though.,0
"Other features it has, but I haven't really used:",0
Room Monitor: we already have a baby monitor and I don't care to snoop on guests so...,1
Digital Answering System: I sent an email to Panasonic asking if they were going to make a system without it and the answer was no.,1
"So, we bit the bullet and found that you can turn it off and it doesn't at all get in the way if you use your Telco company's voice mail system.",1
Which is the way to go if you can ( but that is another review ).,0
"On the other hand, it doesn't have any features which let you know that you have voicemail like other phones, but you still have the stuttered dial tone and we also have external Caller ID boxes which indicate voicemail.",0
One minor gripe:,0
Caller ID and Multiple Local Area codes: So far the weakest link on this system.,0
"Instead of just plugging in say 3 area codes to indicate that they are local calls, you have to click this'edit' button on the handset for calls which have come in to change them from; 1-756-222-2222 to 756-222-2222, then call the number.",0
"Once you have done this, it will remember that any number with that area code is local.",0
The manual says it will do this for up to 4 area codes.,0
Another stickler is that this setting is saved individually on each handset.,0
Bought this phone 2 weeks ago and so far I am very pleased.,0
I am a professional in the business telecommunications field specializing in Key and PBX system design.,0
"I am currently using the KXTG5110 at my home however, I have tested it via analog connection to my office Key system.",0
This makes for a creative solution in that any analog phone may be deployed through an available analog port on a business phones system.,0
The KXTG5110 becomes an extension in itself but now you get the ability to conference multiple Panasonic handsets behind the key system while on an intercom OR an outside line.,0
This can be very cost effective as it economizes on analog ports on the phone system.,0
"For the rest of us though, it will be a great phone for the household.",0
I have found no issues regarding battery life as long as you FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE USER GUIDE.,1
Don't recharge the handset until the display message directs you to do so.,1
The Panasonic headset work seamlessly and provides an inline volume and mute control.,0
Mailboxes are able to each have their own greeting and you can set the time limit for incoming messages but only on a global basis.,0
"1,2,or 3 minutes.",0
I have mine set at 2 minutes.Audio quality is excellent and range if fair and depends on your environment.,0
I also use a 2.4Ghz wireless computer network and experience no interference. I enjoy the different ring tones ( 6 total )and each handset as well as the base can be set to the same or different tones.,1
"If you're looking to buy a really nice and an honestly good 5.8GHz system with some very nice features, then seriously consider this one if you don't mind the price.",1
Bought the system a few weeks ago with 2 extra hand sets for a total of 4 hand sets.,0
Although our home is not big we do enjoy having the option of several hand sets.,1
One feature which I really love is the built-in speaker phone in the hand sets.,0
"Its one of those""why didn't anyone think of this before"" options.",0
"This system replaced another one that we bought at a local discount club, which was horrible and much hated from the moment it was connected.",0
Should have know better since the price was $ 60 for three a hand set system.,0
A good example of you get what you pay for.,0
Before deciding on this system I seriously was looking at the Seimens system and came'oh-so-close' to buying it.,0
But something told me to look a little further and then I found this system.,0
"The Seimens system looks really sleek but all the reviews are either neutral or negative, and in some cases very negative.",0
"This gives me no interference what so ever with the wireless network in the house, which was a major gripe with the older 900 MHz system we had.",1
If your home is huge this will use up to eight hand sets.,0
If you home requires more then you have enough money to install a professional system.,0
"So far I love the system, my wife on the other hand keeps saying""its a guy thing"".",0
Absolutely.,0
I've had the phone for about a week and so far I'm very impressed.,0
"Initially, I had a lot of interference on the phone, but then I realized that I had it set up near a wall that had a lot of wiring in it ( right behind my house's main electrical panel! ).",0
I moved the base station to a different room and it's been great!,0
Sound quality is vastly improved over my 2.4 Ghz Panasonic and there's absolutely no interference with my wireless network.,1
My favorite feature so far is the built-in speaker phone in the handset.,0
That's a life saver when sitting on hold waiting for tech support people.,0
"Again, so far, so good.",0
I'd recommend it - especially for people with wireless 802.11b networks.,0
We LOVE this phone!,0
With the help of Consumer Reports and Epinions.com,0
reviewers we went out and bought this phone.,0
We had already gone through 2 cordless phones.,0
"One we loved most things about, but the handset was uncomfortable and tiny as well as the sound quality being very poor.",0
SOOO we were looking for THE BEST this time.,0
We feel we found what we were looking for in this phone.,0
The sound is GREAT on both sets and all the features make it very convenient!,0
Pros: Range/Reception; Expansion Capability; Ability to talk on more than 1 handset at a time,0
"Cons: Deleting Caller ID on each handset, Message Light quits flashing if you've listened to messages",0
Purchased this product this past year after months of research ( my wife thought I was nuts - but now she is glad I did - see below ).,0
The Internet was the most helpful and convenient way to do this.,0
We wanted a system that had a corded handset w/digital answering machine for our kitchen and the capability to have at least two other handsets ( 1 for upstairs 1 for downstairs ).,0
"We decided to purchase the""kx-tga 273s"" additional handset ( bedroom phone/alarm clock/radio ).",0
Cleaned up our nightstand tremendously - thank god.,0
I could go into all the numerous features this system offers - but that would take forever.,0
We use the majority of them ( the manual explained them in easy to learn terms ).,0
"All in all, like the title says"" we couldn't be happier"" with our purchase and the cons I described are not really cons, just minor inconveniences.",1
I bought this phone in June and reserved judgment until I used it for a while.,0
My choices were limited due to the features I wanted.,0
"I wanted a digital, 3 mailbox voicemail, a cordless handset, and my wife wanted a corded handset.",0
I tease her about being a Luddite but she has small hands and the large cordless handsets are uncomfortable.,0
I was forced to apologize to her during the blackout in August because it was the only phone in the house that worked.,0
As a rule I like Panasonic gear.,0
This phone didn't let me down.,0
"The sound is good, the range is great, and I like the separate charger stand for the cordless.",0
I would have preferred a manual channel selector as it interferes with my 802.11g router on some channels.,0
That was fixed at the router end though.,0
The only other complaint I have is that I can't transfer a message from one mailbox to another.,1
"After researching, this system jumped out.",0
"Having a home office, I used a Uniden cordless system.",0
The handset inevitably ran out of power at the wrong times and I was without a phone.,1
"Panasonic smartly provides a base unit and remote, each with a dialing pad.",0
"It is an attractive, high quality device I would recommend highly.",0
"There are too many features to list including speakerphone ( also from remote)conferencing, ring tones, etc.",0
I couldn't be more satisfied...and I can add more hand sets.,0
