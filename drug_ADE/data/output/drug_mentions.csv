7710,0rxtati9,0rxtati997710,Comparison of two hypothetical scenarios: one with large zoonotic spillover and one with small zoonotic spillover,"To date, as at 22 January, official information has not been sufficient to determine the source of infection and risk of human-to-human transmission for the newly emerged 2019-nCoV. Two competing hypotheses are therefore proposed and compared as potential explanations for the characteristics of the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV infections within and outside mainland China."

31151,ju35nyir,ju35nyir1031151,Conclusions and Future Directions,"Niclosamide has traditionally been used to treat tapeworm infections for many years, and it
is inexpensive and well tolerated in vivo with an extremely high acute oral
LD50 value of >5000 mg/kg in rats (niclosamide ethanolamine salt).10 In human medicines, single oral doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 g of niclosamide are
recommended for children under 2 years, children between 2 and 6 years, and children older
than 6 years and adults, respectively, to treat infections with Taenia
solium, T. saginata, and Diphyllobothrium
latum.10 Human infections with rat tapeworm
Hymenolepis diminuta were eliminated by 5–7 daily doses of 2 g of

in ulcerative colitis, prostate carcinoma, and colorectal cancer in the ClinicalTrails.gov
clinical trials registry.56 Of note, niclosamide has several weaknesses
such as unneglectable cytotoxicity and limited aqueous solubility as well as relatively low
absorption and oral bioavailability (F = 10%), which may hamper its
extensive clinical development as an antiviral agent.57 Our group has
made substantial efforts in medicinal chemistry based on niclosamide as a lead compound and
discovered a series of O-alkylamino-tethered derivatives as potent and
orally bioavailable anticancer agents with improved aqueous solubility16
and diversified salicylamide derivatives as potent anti-HAdV inhibitors with increased
potency (submicromolar IC50s) and significantly decreased cytotoxicity likely by
targeting different steps in the HAdV life cycle.58"

1025,161zm74f,161zm74f171025,Results and Discussion,It has been reported that mannose with ethanolamine linker spotted onto glass slides with the amine-reactive linker can be well used for detect E.coli strains [24] .
1026,161zm74f,161zm74f171026,Results and Discussion,"Similarly, we have found that mannose with ethanolamine linker exhibited stronger binding affinity to Salmonella strains than mannose with aromatic amine linker by microarray, although mannosides with an aromatic aglycon have been reported to bind with FimH protein in a better manner and thus be significant inhibitors of Type 1 fimbriaemediated bacterial adhesion [27, [29] [30] The linker containing phenyl structure may have lower rigidity and thus change the spatial arrangement of the glycan ligands on the surface."

1037,161zm74f,161zm74f211037,Results and Discussion,"The binding between the immobilized mannose and FimH protein may be interfered when the linker is too long, which could result unsuitable stereo-direction of the glycans on the glass slides surface."

1051,161zm74f,161zm74f241051,Results and Discussion,"The weak binding of other serovars with this mannose microarray ([S/N] <= 5) are probably due to the low binding affinity between the Salmonella serovar and monomannose residue on the surface, for example, FimH adhesin of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium bind strongly to high-mannose oligosaccharides [46] Furthermore, the isolates of the same Salmonella serovar exhibited different binding affinity with the microarray, since the same serovar also contain high-and low-adhesive allelic variants of FimH adhesin, such as S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis [47] ."

8473,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux2808473,title,Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2
8474,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux2808474,abstract,We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country.
8476,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux2808476,abstract,For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers.
8480,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux2808480,abstract,In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation.
8505,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux28178505,Results,"Similarly, we estimate that in the absence of syndromic air traveller screening, traveller sensitisation can delay the outbreak by 29 days (75%: 12 days, 97.5% 3 days) early in the epidemic with 1 infected traveller per week but delays reduce to 3 days (75%: 1 day, 97.5%: less than 1 day) for 10 infected travellers per week."
8532,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux28238532,Discussion,Syndromic screening of air travellers at departure and/or arrival is unlikely to prevent a sufficient proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected travellers from entering a yet unaffected country and thereby prevent a local outbreak.
8543,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux28248543,Discussion,"These results are sensitive to a number of key assumptions: with increasing R 0 , less heterogeneous R 0 or less effect of traveller sensitisation the estimated achievable delay quickly becomes negligible We find a potential role for interventions targeting air-passengers to delay major outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in previously unaffected regions as long as implemented when there are only a few infected travellers per week."
8548,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux28258548,Discussion,"While our findings may encourage implementation of both syndromic screening on entry and traveller sensitisation in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is important to note that these findings are highly sensitive to the underlying base-case assumptions and do not consider the economic implications of large scale air passenger screening and contact tracing."
8550,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux28258550,Discussion,"While all of our assumptions include the best knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 to date, there is considerable uncertainty associated with all of these assumptions."
8567,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux28288567,Discussion,"This may suggest that indeed the UK and some parts of Europe are still in a situation where air-traveller targeted interventions may substantially delay major local outbreaks, however, under-reporting of cases is likely and with quickly rising case numbers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Korea and now Iran and Italy as well this situation may change rapidly in the coming days and weeks."
8569,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux28298569,Discussion,"In our work, we did not investigate such a drastic interruption of air travel."
8572,y7d3ux28,y7d3ux28308572,Discussion,"In summary, we find that targeting air-travellers with syndromic screening at exit or entry and sensitisation for signs of symptoms following their arrival may delay a major outbreak in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak."

19181,8prn86g6,8prn86g6019181,abstract,"We demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymerase inhibitors, 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate, 3'-azido-3'deoxythymidine triphosphate and Tenofovir diphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine, AZT and TAF, respectively) to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp"
19192,8prn86g6,8prn86g6119192,Introduction,"10 Using polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrated that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir was incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp, and blocked further incorporation."
19194,8prn86g6,8prn86g6119194,Introduction,"Alovudine and AZT share a similar backbone structure (base and ribose) to Sofosbuvir, but have fewer modification sites and less steric hindrance."
19198,8prn86g6,8prn86g6119198,Introduction,"Using structure-activity based molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate form of Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, Vemlidy, an acyclic adenosine nucleotide) ( Fig. 1 c) , which is an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, for evaluation as a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor."

19205,8prn86g6,8prn86g6119205,Introduction,"16 In view of the fact that the active triphosphate form of TAF, Tenofovir diphosphate, is much smaller than natural nucleoside triphosphates, we expect that it can easily fit within the active site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp."
19208,8prn86g6,8prn86g6219208,Results and Discussion,"We thus assessed the ability of 2'-F,Me-UTP, 3'-F-dTTP, TFV-DP, and 3'-N 3 -dTTP (the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, TAF and AZT, respectively), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp into an RNA primer and terminate the polymerase reaction."
19217,8prn86g6,8prn86g6319217,Results and Discussion,"Because the two A's in the template are followed by 4 U's, in the case of the TFV-DP/UTP mixture, two UTP's should be incorporated prior to the incorporation and termination by TFV-DP, which has an adenosine base."

21772,ptnmtvzj,ptnmtvzj4621772,DISCUSSION,"There were however important safety signals identified in the included studies, particularly the possible development of anemia and altered liver function in patients receiving ribavirin treatment."
21774,ptnmtvzj,ptnmtvzj4621774,DISCUSSION,This review does show however that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards studies of ribavirin which has shown no particular efficacy in treating coronavirus and may in fact cause harmful adverse effects.

8881,q96nsa22,q96nsa22238881,Estimating number of airplane passengers from 18 Chinese cities to international destinations,The sharp decline in air-travel volume after 23 January 2020 is a result of the travel restrictions and flight cancellations that occurred starting late January; the number of flight departures 23 January 2020 to 28 February 2020 is approximately 60% less than that of the same time period in 2019.
8903,q96nsa22,q96nsa22288903,Model application: Predicting exported case counts to subset of African countries,The relatively low number of mean cases estimated to be imported to each of the African countries in our analysis during the total epidemic period may in part be due to the sharp reduction in air-travel volume starting late January to these countries (Supplementary Figure 3) .
8914,q96nsa22,q96nsa2258914,Data,We define three groups of locations for our analyses: 1) Chinese cities as likely sources of exported cases; 2) international locations with high surveillance capacity and high air travel connectivity to Wuhan (used for model calibration); and 3) African locations as destinations (used for model prediction).

8921,q96nsa22,q96nsa2278921,Data,"Historical air-travel volume data are likely not representative of the epidemic time period for two reasons : 1) Lunar New Year was earlier than in preceding years (25 January 2020), and 2) large-scale travel bans and flight cancellations took place in late January 2020."
8922,q96nsa22,q96nsa2278922,Data,"We therefore combined monthly historical air-travel volume data with recent daily flight departure data to estimate daily air-travel volume out of cities in China to our destinations of interest during the total epidemic period, as described in the Supplement."

14396,if7av1x8,if7av1x81814396,2-2. Empirical Strategy,"As both city and week fixed effects are included in the regression, the coefficient 2 estimates the difference in air pollution between the treated (locked-down) cities and the control cities before and after the enforcement of the lockdown policy."
14397,if7av1x8,if7av1x81814397,2-2. Empirical Strategy,"We expect the coefficient 2 to be negative, as the industrial and business activities were restricted in the locked-down cities, and thus their air pollution levels should significantly decrease."
14403,if7av1x8,if7av1x82014403,2-2. Empirical Strategy,"We include leads of the treatment dummy in the equation, testing whether the treatment affects the air pollution levels before the launch of the policy."

14405,if7av1x8,if7av1x82014405,2-2. Empirical Strategy,"We expect lockdown would improve air quality with 2 $ being negative when , ≥ 0."

14413,if7av1x8,if7av1x8714413,2-1. Data,The core of our empirical analysis uses a comprehensive air quality data in China.

14442,if7av1x8,if7av1x83814442,3-2. Heterogeneity,"The difference could be driven by the fact that colder cities consumed more coals for heating, and lockdown reduces such consumption in offices, plants, and schools, which eventually led to a greater improvement in air quality."
14454,if7av1x8,if7av1x84014454,3-2. Heterogeneity,"To summarize, the impact of city lockdown on air quality is more considerable in colder, larger, richer, and more industrialized cities."
14455,if7av1x8,if7av1x84014455,3-2. Heterogeneity,"This finding implies that coal consumption, industrial activities, and transportation all contribute substantially to air pollution in China."

14459,if7av1x8,if7av1x84314459,Potential Benefits from Improved Air Quality,"First, we focus on quasi-experimental studies that investigate how exogenous changes in air quality affects health outcomes."
14460,if7av1x8,if7av1x84314460,Potential Benefits from Improved Air Quality,"As the air pollution variation could be confounded by factors that also affect population health, the estimates from these studies are generally recognized as being more credible than those based on associational models (e.g., Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2013; Dominici et al., 2014) ."

14569,if7av1x8,if7av1x8314569,Introduction,"Second, China also suffers greatly from severe air pollution problems, with some estimates suggesting that air pollution is associated with an annual loss of nearly 25 million healthy life years (Kassebaum et al., 2014) ."
14570,if7av1x8,if7av1x8314570,Introduction,"If city lockdown indeed significantly improved the air quality in China, the implied health benefits would be an order of magnitude larger than in countries with lower initial pollution levels."
14572,if7av1x8,if7av1x8414572,Introduction,We thus estimate a set of differencein-differences (DiD) models to quantify the impact of city lockdown on air pollution.
14573,if7av1x8,if7av1x8414573,Introduction,"Using air quality data from more than 1,600 monitoring stations in China, we find that city lockdown indeed improved the air quality: compared to cities without formal lockdown policies, the weekly Air Quality Index (AQI) and PM2.5 concentration in the locked-down cities declined respectively by 19.4 points (18%) and 13.9 µg/m 3 (17%)."
14574,if7av1x8,if7av1x8414574,Introduction,"3 To further address the concern that cities without formal lockdown policies might also be affected by the diseases preventative measures (e.g., all cities extended the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, required social distancing and urged people to stay at home), we estimate another set of DiD 3 The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a comprehensive measure of air pollution in China and also widely used around the world."

14583,if7av1x8,if7av1x8614583,Introduction,"A back-of-envelope calculation shows that the improved air quality induced the counter-COVID-19 measures could avert 24,000 to 36,000 premature deaths on a monthly basis."
14584,if7av1x8,if7av1x8614584,Introduction,"As air pollution also affects morbidity, productivity, and people's defensive expenditure (e.g., air filters), the implied benefits could be even greater if such improvement could sustain (e.g., Deschênes et al., 2017; Barwick et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Ito and Zhang, 2020) ."
14585,if7av1x8,if7av1x8614585,Introduction,"Second, our findings show that traffic, industrial, and business activities are indeed important sources of air pollution."
14587,if7av1x8,if7av1x8614587,Introduction,"Finally, while the air quality improvement during this period was unprecedented, the baseline air pollution level after city lockdown remained high."
14589,if7av1x8,if7av1x8614589,Introduction,"This finding suggests that other sources of air pollution continue to contribute significantly: in particular, the coal-fired winter heating system could be the primary polluting source during our study period"

14617,if7av1x8,if7av1x84814617,Conclusion,"Using a timely and comprehensive dataset, we investigate the effect of city lockdown on air quality in China, which could bring about massive social benefits and partially offset the costs of the COVID-19 epidemic."
14618,if7av1x8,if7av1x84814618,Conclusion,We find such drastic preventive measures have a significant impact on air quality.
14619,if7av1x8,if7av1x84814619,Conclusion,"We estimated that after its implementation, air quality declined by around 25% (28.2 points for AQI, and 22.3µg/m 3 for PM2.5) relative to the same season in 2019."

14622,if7av1x8,if7av1x84914622,Conclusion,The remarkable improvement in air quality could lead to substantial health benefits.
14624,if7av1x8,if7av1x84914624,Conclusion,"However, these studies are less relevant to our research contest as they use data at least a decade ago and focus on coarse measures of air pollution, such as total suspended particles (TSP"
14627,if7av1x8,if7av1x85014627,Conclusion,"1101 Based on the previous estimates on the relationship between air pollution and mortality, we show that averted premature deaths per month could be around 24,000 to 36,000, which is an order of magnitude larger than the number of deaths caused directly by COVID-19 in China (WHO, 2020)."
14628,if7av1x8,if7av1x85014628,Conclusion,"As air pollution also has significant impacts on morbidity, productivity, and defensive investment, our estimates should be interpreted as the lower-bound of the benefits that can be derived from the air quality improvement."
14632,if7av1x8,if7av1x85114632,Conclusion,"As cities may recover their production after the lockdown, the short-term improvement in air quality could be offset in the longer term."
14633,if7av1x8,if7av1x85214633,Conclusion,"Second, we examine the effect of city shutdown on outdoor air quality and do not account for indoor air quality in our benefit calculation."
14635,if7av1x8,if7av1x85214635,Conclusion,"If indoor air quality is worse than outdoor air quality (e.g., some areas rely heavily on inefficient coal-fired stoves for heating), the beneficial effects from better outdoor air quality could be reduced."
14641,if7av1x8,if7av1x85214641,Conclusion,"In comparison, COVID-19 may have raised individuals' awareness 9 For example, the morbidity cost of air pollution is found to be around two-thirds of mortality costs in China (Barwick et al., 2018) , All rights reserved."

21203,7edmbp1o,7edmbp1o3821203,Discussion,"In addition, in these areas of low air quality, the virus kills more often than elsewhere."
21205,7edmbp1o,7edmbp1o3921205,Discussion,"However, it is remarkable that we obtained consistent significant correlations between air pollution variables and risk factors for COVID-19, despite varying population densities within and between the countries."
21206,7edmbp1o,7edmbp1o3921206,Discussion,"By controlling for the number of infections per 100,000 habitants, we found statistically significant, positive correlations between COVID-19 infections and low air quality in each of the three assessed countries."

823,662pfa61,662pfa6111823,Results and Discussion,"Since SI of tipranavir was less than that of nelfinavir (5.76 vs. 21.52), nelfinavir seems better than tipranavir."

17756,eksi9yia,eksi9yia3617756,Discussion,This observation is notable because the capacity of tetherin to form cysteine-linked dimers is required for the restriction of HIV-1 viral particles (46) which we chose as the VLPs against which bat tetherin proteins were functionally validated for inhibiting viral particle release.

27360,tw7wgpsi,tw7wgpsi027360,Introduction,"Although it may not be feasible or desirable for isolation purposes to perform a chest radiograph (CXR), we should acknowledge that pragmatically patients with a respiratory complaint are likely to present via any number of routes (primary care, emergency departments [EDs] or outpatient clinics) having already had a CXR, other than to isolation pods outside a hospital, and work-up of a respiratory complaint would usually include a CXR in such settings."

Dies führte vielerorts zu Lieferengpässen, da die Bevölkerung sich für alle Fälle eindecken wollte. Aktuelle Untersuchungen in Italien zeigen, dass bis zu 75% der Infektionen mit SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus-2) asymptomatisch ablaufen oder nur sehr leichte Symptome aufweisen.

Fieber kann im Krankheitsverlauf eine Reihe von Vorteilen haben, die genutzt werden sollten. Fieber kann einerseits als prognostisches Kriterium im Rahmen einer Infektionserkrankung betrachtet werden, das mit einer höheren Heilungsrate assoziiert ist. Es hemmt die Reproduktion von Bakterien und die Replikation von Viren. Hitzeschockproteine, die bei Fieber freigesetzt werden, können Zellläsionen verhindern. Aufgrund der aktuellen Evidenz ist es nicht begründet, Medikamente wie Ibuprofen oder Paracetamol zur routinemäßigen Behandlung von akuten respiratorischen Infektionen einschließlich Covid-19 einzusetzen. Dies gilt insbesondere bei milden Verläufen. Ein bewährtes alternatives Medikament bei hohem Fieber, das auf andere Maßnahmen nicht anspricht, ist Novaminsulfon."

ASS hat eine ausgeprägte thrombozytenaggregationshemmende Wirkung.Bei Ibuprofen dagegen ist dieser Effekt auf die Blutgerinnung kaum relevant.Paracetamol ist in der Schmerztherapie kaum wirksam. Es kann jedoch ggf. zur leichten Fiebersenkung erwogen werden.NSAR wie Ibuprofen, ASS und Diclofenac haben zusätzlich eine antiinflammatorische Wirkung.

The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity.

20710,4vfnjlr9,4vfnjlr9020710,abstract,"The dose of chloroquine ranged between 100-500 mg/day, except in one patient, the seizure was after taking 1000 mg."
20712,4vfnjlr9,4vfnjlr9020712,abstract,The only clinical trial that evaluated seizure risk with chloroquine failed to find any significant relation.
20714,4vfnjlr9,4vfnjlr9020714,abstract,The only randomized clinical study revealed that seizures were not associated with an increased blood level of chloroquine or its metabolite.
20715,4vfnjlr9,4vfnjlr9020715,abstract,"The present systematic review should provide reassurance to busy clinicians and persons with epilepsy that chloroquine, if prescribed to treat COVID-19, lacks any substantial evidence to suggest that the medication increases the risk of seizure."

Abstract: On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Hubei Province of China first unveiled a group of unexplained cases of pneumonia, which WHO subsequently defined as the new coronavirus of 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 has presented rapid person-to-person transmission and is currently a global pandemic. In the largest number of cases described to date of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease (2019-nCoViD), 26% required care in an intensive care unit (ICU). This pandemic is causing an unprecedented mobilization of the scientific community, which has been Page 2 of 42 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f associated with an exponentially growing number of publications in relation to it.

La ventilación en decúbito prono no contraindica la nutrición vía enteral. En un estudio prospectivo no encontraron mayor incidencia de complicaciones digestivas ni respiratorias respecto a la posición supina y recomendaron la elevación del cabecero a 25º durante la VMI en decúbito prono (80). En otro estudio prospectivo en pacientes ventilados en decúbito prono con relajación, concluyen que la NE es factible, segura y no se asocia a mayor riesgo de complicaciones gastrointestinales ni de neumonía por broncoaspiración siempre que se realice una estrecha monitorización de la tolerancia a la NE. En ambos estudios la NE se administró a través de sonda nasogástrica (81) . Las complicaciones gastrointestinales de la NE, como aumento del residuo gástrico, estreñimiento, diarrea asociada a NE, vómitos, regurgitación, dolor o distensión abdominal y broncoaspiración, son causa de hiponutrición, por lo que se deben identificar y tener protocolos de manejo (82, 83) . La diarrea es frecuente en el paciente crítico, pero sólo un 10-18% de los casos es secundaria a la NE, siendo mayoritariamente multifactorial (84) . Revisar la polimedicación que reciben estos enfermos e incluso investigar posibles causas infecciosas, permite descartar que la dieta enteral sea responsable de la diarrea y evitar la suspensión de la misma de forma innecesaria."

Evitar tocarse los ojos, la nariz y la boca antes de lavarse las manos. 2. Debe realizarse la limpieza habitual de las superficies de la casa regularmente. Limpie y desinfecte objetos y superficies que se toquen con frecuencia. 3. Evite el contacto o mantenga una distancia de al menos 2 m con personas que padecen síntomas de infección respiratoria (fiebre, tos, dolores musculares generalizados, dolor de garganta o dificultad respiratoria), y no comparta con ellas las pertenencias personales. 4. Durante el estado de alarma, se debe permanecer en el domicilio salvo las excepciones estipuladas, según las normas establecidas por las autoridades políticas y sanitarias. Avise telefónicamente a la consulta de trasplante renal de su centro de referencia o a los teléfonos habilitados por las autoridades sanitarias. 5. Trate de seguir una correcta alimentación. Evite el consumo de tabaco y alcohol. Además de ser perjudiciales para la salud, estas sustancias debilitan el sistema inmunológico, por lo que el organismo es más vulnerable ante enfermedades infecciosas. 6. Evite compartir comida y utensilios (cubiertos, vasos, servilletas, pañuelos, etc y otros objetos sin limpiarlos debidamente. 7. Los centros para la prevención y control de enfermedades (CDC, del inglés Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) no recomiendan en población general que las personas que estén bien usen una máscara facial para protegerse de las enfermedades respiratorias, incluido el COVID-19. A día de hoy, la población trasplantada renal debe cumplir las medidas de protección recomendadas en la población general, especialmente si están asintomáticas en su domicilio. No obstante, los facultativos responsables recomendarán de manera individualizada el empleo de mascarilla, principalmente en los casos donde el paciente acuda a un centro sanitario u otro lugar de aglomeración. Las personas que muestran síntomas de estar infectadas por el SARS-CoV-2 deben usar mascarillas para ayudar a prevenir la propagación de la enfermedad a otras personas. 8.

4857,9f2kv1so,9f2kv1so04857,abstract,"After two weeks of lockdown, urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants."
4866,9f2kv1so,9f2kv1so94866,Discussion,"As it could be expected, the lockdown, including restricted social contact, closing of restaurants, shops, and a large number of companies and administrative centers, temporarily reduced levels of specific air pollutants, mostly the primary dominated ones."
4873,9f2kv1so,9f2kv1so94873,Discussion,"Thus, a relevant proportion of PM10 has a regional background-origin, mostly of secondary PM, and regional air mass transport might have influenced PM10 to the point of reducing the effects of local emission abatement."

4886,9f2kv1so,9f2kv1so154886,Discussion,"In conclusion, we expect that air quality will keep improving for PM10, PM2.5, BC, and NO 2 down to minimal levels during forthcoming weeks because of the more restrictive actions to reduce the population's mobility and shut down of a large number of industries."
4887,9f2kv1so,9f2kv1so154887,Discussion,The air pollution effects of the lockdown will be a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of the reduction of different emission sources and to assess further air quality policies.
4888,9f2kv1so,9f2kv1so154888,Discussion,"However, we should clearly state that air quality policy is a long-distance race and that the effects of past emergencies (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis) for further air quality and climate policies have always been adverse."

16041,zcxsg7ok,zcxsg7ok216041,To the Editor,"In particular, fine particles, such as PM2.5, tend to stay longer in the air than heavier particles and their minute size increases the chances to let them penetrate deep into the lungs, bypassing the nose and throat."
16042,zcxsg7ok,zcxsg7ok216042,To the Editor,This leads to progressive and chronic inflammation of the respiratory airways with excessive mucus production and decreased ciliary activity with subjects chronically exposed to air pollutants more prone to develop severe respiratory diseases after viral infections.

34865,iaktm72a,iaktm72a2834865,Synthesis and characterization of Ag@cur-P(MEO2MA) core-doped shell nanohybrids ::: Results and Discussion,"This behavior is attributed to the high nucleation of the nanoparticles due to the high concentration of citrate that causes a greater ion exchange and increases the total ionic strength in the solution, promoting the formation of particle agglomerates in some cases."

34882,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4034882,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,"The position of the emission maxima of curcumin is strongly dependent on the solvent; so by increasing the polarity from chloroform to water, the emission maximum is red-shifted and broadened from 497 nm to 550 nm42."
34883,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4034883,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,Both the QY values and the emission maxima position for the present cur-G nanogels seem to indicate that curcumin is well protected by the hydrophobic environment provided by the polymer.
34884,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4134884,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,"With respect to the QY values, two facts have been observed: first, the QY value increases with the decrease of curcumin concentration in the nanogels (Fig. 6A and Table 3); and, second, an amazing fluorescence enhancement is noticed by the temperature increase (Fig. 6B)."
34885,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4234885,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,"The effect of curcumin concentration could be related to the protection that hydrophobic domains of the polymer offer to curcumin, which is enhanced at low curcumin/polymer ratio."
34886,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4234886,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,The increase of luminescence with increasing temperature should be associated to the water expelled out of the nanogels when temperature rises above VPTT.
34887,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4234887,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,"Indeed, at lower curcumin ratio (Fig. 6B), the remarkable increase in absorbance at 50 °C can be attributed to the higher polymer contribution."
34891,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4334891,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,"On the other hand, for both series of Ag@cur-G hybrid NPs, an increase of luminescence with increasing of curcumin concentration is detected, in opposite to what happened in cur-G nanogels (Table 3 and Fig. 6A)."
34893,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4334893,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,Note that this absorption band reflects the additive contribution from the overlapped silver and curcumin SPR bands.
34894,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4334894,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,"Then, on the basis of these considerations, at lower curcumin concentration, the real curcumin contribution to the final absorbance will be lower."
34898,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4434898,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,"This experimental evidence suggests a change on the curcumin-polymer interaction due to the silver presence, or in this specific case, that the interaction of curcumin with silver played a major role, since the specific silver-nucleation strategy causes that certain amount of curcumin be confined at the metal surface."
34899,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4534899,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,The fluorescence diminution that accompanies the temperature decrease may find its origin in the hydrophilicity-gain experienced by the thermoresponsive polymer shell and the subsequent quenching of curcumin emission induced by water.
34900,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4534900,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,"Whereas, when increasing temperature, the polymer increases its hydrophobic balance, which should contribute to protect curcumin against water; nevertheless this positive effect could be overcome by the fact that after polymer collapse, curcumin can get too close to the metal surface and this effect should lead to a further emission quenching."
34901,iaktm72a,iaktm72a4534901,Luminescent Properties ::: Results and Discussion,"Similar observation was reported on the strong curcumin emission-quenching for other silver NP-based hybrid systems by other authors19,20."

13646,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4513646,WATER QUALITY,These generally describe obvious conditions of water.
13650,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4513650,WATER QUALITY,"A comprehensive quantitative water analysis, obviously, has higher precision compared to qualitative analysis (Osmonics, 1997) ."
13651,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s513651,WATER IN FOOD PRODUCTION,"In a very broad sense, there are four major uses of water in food production: (1) primary production, (2) cleaning and sanitation, (3) processing operations, and (4) as food ingredient."
13652,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7013652,Electrochemically Activated Water,Treatment with electrochemically activated water has recently become increasingly popular.
13653,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7013653,Electrochemically Activated Water,An electrochemical cell generates a highly oxidized fluid (An electrochemical cell generates a highly oxidized fluid) and a reduced fluid (cathode) using just water and salt.
13655,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7013655,Electrochemically Activated Water,"The oxidized water has higher oxidation-reduction-potential (ORP) of up to 11300 mV, whereas, chlorine-based solutions have up to 1800 mV. The solution is meta-stable for up to a couple of weeks and like chlorine-dioxide generated onsite."
13657,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7013657,Electrochemically Activated Water,Small quantities of these will be dosed into the water system.
13658,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7013658,Electrochemically Activated Water,Several manufacturers claim that this is a chemical-free method for water treatment.
13662,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4813662,Biological Contaminants,The resistance/susceptibility of these organisms to commonly used water treatments and the way of transmission need to be considered to ensure water quality.
13663,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4813663,Biological Contaminants,Most of the pathogens do not grow in water.
13664,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4813664,Biological Contaminants,These pathogens are introduced into the water by animal and/or human sewage.
13665,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4813665,Biological Contaminants,"However, some are environmental pathogens that can normally grow in water."
13667,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4813667,Biological Contaminants,"The risks related to Legionella have to be considered with respect to personnel safety (showers/washrooms), and as well to the wider environment of the plant, such as cooling towers that are used from where water can spread into the wider surrounding (Castilla et al., 2008) ."
13669,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4813669,Biological Contaminants,"The European guidelines also provide information with respect to effective treatments/disinfection of water systems (EU-OSHA, 2005) ."
13670,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4913670,Biological Contaminants,Food industries must have a system in place to ensure that they are continuously using safe/potable water in food production and processing.
13671,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4913671,Biological Contaminants,"The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) periodically reminds industries to follow water safety requirements for food production, processing, and handling, and maintain an action plan in the event of a major accident/water safety alert (CFIA"
13675,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s5013675,Biological Contaminants,Some common biological contaminants of water encountered in food industries are shown in Table 9 .4.
13676,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s013676,Introduction 219,Resources of Water 220
13677,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s613677,Water in Primary Production,Food and agriculture sectors are the largest consumers of water.
13678,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s613678,Water in Primary Production,The largest use of water is in primary food production.
13679,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s613679,Water in Primary Production,"In agriculture, water is predominantly used for crop irrigation purposes."
13680,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s613680,Water in Primary Production,"In livestock farming, large volumes of water are used for livestock watering along with maintenance of general hygiene of the animals and equipment."
13681,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s713681,Water in Primary Production,The demand of water for agriculture is one hundred times more than it is used for personal needs.
13682,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s713682,Water in Primary Production,Global distribution of water is shown in Fig. 9 .1.
13684,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s713684,Water in Primary Production,"The industrial sector uses 19%, while a small fraction of only 12% of the water withdrawals are destined for households and municipal use."
13688,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s713688,Water in Primary Production,"The majority, up to 90% of the water withdrawn for domestic use, is returned to rivers and aquifers as wastewater."
13693,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s813693,Water in Primary Production,"Food production from the livestock sector has diversity such as meat (beef, pork, poultry, and others), dairy products, and fishes, aquatic or sea food."
13694,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s813694,Water in Primary Production,"As the population keeps increasing, more food and livestock feed has to be produced in the future, and obviously more water is required for this purpose."
13695,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s813695,Water in Primary Production,"Thus, agriculture has to claim larger quantities of water to produce the food required to feed the world."
13696,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s913696,Water in Primary Production,The pattern of global agricultural water withdrawal is uneven ( Fig. 9 .2).
13698,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s913698,Water in Primary Production,There is reverse trend in water withdrawal for industrial use.
13700,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s913700,Water in Primary Production,"Asian countries use the highest total volume of water for agriculture in the world (2556 km 3 /year), and the least is in the Oceania countries (25 km 3 /year), which include Australia, New Zealand, and other Pacific Islands (Aquastat, 2014) ."
13701,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1013701,Water in Primary Production,"The concept of ""water footprint"" provides an appropriate framework for analysis to find the link between the consumption of animal products and the use of the global water resources."
13702,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1013702,Water in Primary Production,"The water footprint is defined as ""the total volume of freshwater that is used to produce the goods and services consumed by an individual or community."
13703,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1013703,Water in Primary Production,""" It is baffling but true that the water footprint of any animal product is larger than the water footprint of a wisely chosen crop product with equivalent nutritional value."
13704,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1013704,Water in Primary Production,"The most logical reason lies in the fact that animals are secondary consumers in the food chain; therefore, in the calculation of water footprint of animals always adds up inherent increments of primary consumers."
13705,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1013705,Water in Primary Production,Twenty-nine percent of the total water footprint of the agricultural products in the world is related to the generation of animal products.
13706,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1013706,Water in Primary Production,"One third of the global water footprint of animal production is related to beef cattle (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2010) ."
13709,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1113709,Water in Primary Production,This intensification of animal production systems will result in increasing blue and gray water footprints per unit of animal product due to the larger dependence on concentrate feed in industrial systems.
13710,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1113710,Water in Primary Production,"The pressure on the global freshwater resources will therefore increase both because of the increasing meat consumption and the increasing blue and gray water footprint per unit of meat consumed (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2010) ."
13711,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1213711,Water in Primary Production,Plants require water in adequate quantities and at the right time for vegetative growth and development.
13712,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1213712,Water in Primary Production,"Crops have very specific water requirements, and these vary depending on local climate conditions."
13713,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1213713,Water in Primary Production,The production of meat requires between 6 and 20 times more water than for cereals.
13714,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1213714,Water in Primary Production,"An overview of the water consumption in food and agriculture is given in Table 9 .1, which shows examples of water required per unit of major food products, including livestock that consume the most water per unit."
13715,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1213715,Water in Primary Production,"Cereals, oil crops, and pulses, roots, and tubers consume far less water (FAO, 2003) ."
13716,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1313716,Water in Primary Production,"Virtual water concept emerged in the 1990s to draw increasing focus of people concerned with water management, and in particular with water related to food production."
13717,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1313717,Water in Primary Production,"Virtual water is defined as the water embedded in a product, that is, the water consumed during its process of production."
13719,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1313719,Water in Primary Production,"On an average, it takes 2À4 L/day to satisfy the biological needs of drinking water of a human being."
13720,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1313720,Water in Primary Production,This may be around 1000 times as much water as required to produce the food for normal person.
13721,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1313721,Water in Primary Production,"Therefore, the concept of virtual water is so important when discussing food production and consumption."
13722,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1313722,Water in Primary Production,"In other words, when a country imports 1 million tons of wheat, it is also enlarging its water resource by 1 billion m 3 of water."
13723,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1313723,Water in Primary Production,"Specific values for the water equivalent of a selection of food products are variable, and it is highest for animal food."
13725,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1313725,Water in Primary Production,"At a global level, the importance of virtual water is likely to dramatically increase as projections show that food trade will increase rapidly."
13727,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1313727,Water in Primary Production,"Hence, the transfer of virtual water embedded in the food which is traded is becoming an important component of water management on a global as well as regional level, especially in the water scarce regions (Renault, 2002) ."
13738,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4713738,Physical Contaminants,"Physical contaminants are derived from incoming water that is not usually controlled by filtration, and it can be monitored by turbidity measurements."
13740,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4713740,Physical Contaminants,"Chemical hazards include organic compounds, inorganic elements (e.g., heavy metals), and complex chemicals (e.g., pesticides), which are mentioned in detail in the EU drinking water directive and the WHO guidelines (WHO, 2017a)."
13741,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4713741,Physical Contaminants,"Chemical contaminants occur due to a variety of ways, such as environmental contamination or from a chemical spill, or due to incorrect use of pesticides or because of cross-contamination of the water supply with sewage and/or industrial waste."
13742,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s5913742,WATER TREATMENT,The choice of the most suitable water treatment technique depends on the water source and the intended application of the water.
13744,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s5913744,WATER TREATMENT,"Variable solids and chemical and microbial contents occur in water due to various factors like rainfall events, seasonal weather patterns, distribution system issues, and other factors."
13745,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6013745,WATER TREATMENT,The hygienic design of the water distribution and storage systems are the effective microbiological controls.
13751,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6113751,WATER TREATMENT,All vents should preferably be equipped with an air filter to achieve air filter class F7.
13754,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6113754,WATER TREATMENT,The entire system should be designed such that the maximum stay time of the water does not exceed 24 hours.
13755,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6213755,WATER TREATMENT,The water storage and distribution system design should allow for easy cleaning and disinfection.
13757,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6213757,WATER TREATMENT,"So typically, the water is treated at the entry point into food manufacturing units and the quality is maintained and monitored within the factory."
13758,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6213758,WATER TREATMENT,"The microbiological quality of water is monitored at various points in the plant, including last points of pipes, and appropriate treatments are applied."
13760,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6313760,WATER TREATMENT,"Ideally, water treatment processes should remove pathogens and impurities that may otherwise be harmful to human health or esthetically unpleasant."
13761,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6313761,WATER TREATMENT,Water treatment processes may vary depending on the source water.
13762,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6313762,WATER TREATMENT,"Typically, an adsorbent material is added to the water to bind dirt and form heavy particles, which settle down after sometime to the bottom of a water storage tank for easy separation."
13763,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6313763,WATER TREATMENT,The water is then filtered to remove even smaller particles.
13765,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6413765,WATER TREATMENT,It should be noted that the treatment of water used by the food industry is the obligatory responsibility of the concerned food business using a private water supply.
13766,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6413766,WATER TREATMENT,"Typically, private water supplies require treatment and ongoing monitoring of water quality verification following treatment."
13768,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6413768,WATER TREATMENT,A summary of the most common water treatment techniques in relation to the hazards that need to be controlled is given in Table 9 .5.
13769,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6513769,WATER TREATMENT,"Hardness is generally due to calcium and magnesium ions in water that may deposit in pipes, valves, and process equipment surfaces."
13770,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6513770,WATER TREATMENT,Some food products may not dissolve well in hard water.
13771,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6513771,WATER TREATMENT,"In addition, hardness may affect flavor, aroma, and palatability of foods."
13772,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6613772,WATER TREATMENT,A water softener should be used to decrease hardness.
13774,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6613774,WATER TREATMENT,"If bacteria are suspected, then a disinfection step such as ozone, chlorine, or ultraviolet treatment becomes necessary in the water treatment protocol."
13775,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6613775,WATER TREATMENT,Filtration is recommended in all cases for all potable water use.
13777,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2913777,Water as an Ingredient or Component of Food,It is a very important safety concern when one considers water as part of the food.
13779,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2913779,Water as an Ingredient or Component of Food,"Fruit juices, jams, jellies, pickles, soups, and many more such consumed forms of food products have water as an ingredient."
13780,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3013780,Water as an Ingredient or Component of Food,"It is fundamental that when water is used as a component of food or as an ingredient of the food component, it must be free from undesirable color, odor, taste, and impurities that are harmful to consumers and result in low-quality products."
13781,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3013781,Water as an Ingredient or Component of Food,Ordinary tap water that meets the criteria of the safe drinking water standard may not necessarily achieve these qualifications.
13783,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3013783,Water as an Ingredient or Component of Food,"Activated carbon particles have a massive surface area that adsorbs substances like yeast, chlorine, and those that affect odor and taste, and nonpolar materials such as mineral oil and polyaromatic hydrocarbons."
13790,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8313790,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,"This genetic technology, if carefully regulated and tested, should have much-desired beneficial effects in terms of water conservation."
13791,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8313791,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,"The most logical approach in the genetic modification, for example, should be the selection of the traits to increase the rate of photosynthesis, depth of root structure, as well as a decrease the transpiration rate at which water is lost."
13792,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8313792,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,This strategy should increase the nutrients yield of the crop and at the same time decrease the water requirement of the staple cereal crops.
13793,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8313793,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,These changes have the great positive potential to lower pressures on the amount of global water resources required in food production.
13794,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8313794,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,"The enormous potential and the promising possibilities of genetic engineering and biotechnology research and development have the better future solutions to the current problems of water conservation, specifically in primary food production."
13795,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8313795,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,"Therefore, more precise and highly controlled and targeted genetic modifications should be very helpful in wheat, rice, and maize to increase their water efficiency and drought resistance."
13796,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8313796,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,This approach will work more effectively by implementing genetically altered crops into the advanced and water efficient agricultural system.
13797,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8413797,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,Rice is well known as a very water-intensive food crop.
13798,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8413798,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,"The gene Arabidopsis HARDY is identified to have increased water efficiency of rice by increasing the rate of photosynthesis and decreasing the amount of water loss through transpiration (Karaba et al., 2007) ."
13801,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8513801,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,Genetic modifications of the staple foods like the wheat plant are very much needed for water deficient countries.
13803,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8513803,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,"Deeper root systems facilitate more water uptake, which means the plants require less irrigation and perform better under drought conditions."
13804,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8513804,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,"One example of drought tolerant wheat is SeriM82, also known as ""stay-green wheat."
13806,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8513806,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,This new variety has deeper root systems that lead to greater water uptake.
13807,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8513807,WATER AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD,"It has been shown that this increased water uptake during drought periods gives 14.5% increase in yield compared to the traditional variety (Manschadi et al., 2006) ."
13823,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s113823,INTRODUCTION,"In general, water is often taken lightly in most food preparation and processing operations."
13827,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s113827,INTRODUCTION,The fundamental importance of water quality in food production is often underestimated.
13828,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s113828,INTRODUCTION,"This underestimation generally becomes the underlying cause for several problems, such as mismanagement of water, equipment operation, and maintenance issues; loss of revenue; food safety; and product quality."
13836,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s213836,INTRODUCTION,"Food production also covers chemical, microbiological, and microphysical aspects of water and food safety."
13838,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s213838,INTRODUCTION,"Any pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and microorganisms may produce toxins, which act as possible contaminants of water used in food production and that therefore affect food safety."
13839,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s213839,INTRODUCTION,"At times, microphysical particles such as glass and metal, when present in water, can be hazardous and cause serious harm to consumers."
13841,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s213841,INTRODUCTION,This second type of rain water is called green water.
13842,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s213842,INTRODUCTION,"The proportion of green water, out of the total available freshwater supply, varies between 55% and 80%, depending on the local wood density as well as on the region of the world."
13843,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s213843,INTRODUCTION,"Storing of more green water in soil and plants, as well as storage as blue water, is the biggest opportunity and challenge for future water management."
13844,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s313844,INTRODUCTION,"Out of the total freshwater, over 60% of rain water is green water, which evaporates above savannah grazing land, forests, and agricultural land."
13845,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s313845,INTRODUCTION,"About 40% of rain water (43,000 km 3 ) present in rivers, lakes, groundwater, and glaciers constitutes blue water, which then ultimately flows back into the oceans."
13846,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s313846,INTRODUCTION,Blue water withdrawals by humans are about 9% (or 3900 km 3 ) of total blue water resources.
13847,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s313847,INTRODUCTION,"Of these, 70% is being used for irrigation (2700 km 3 ) and the remaining 1200 km 3 is used for industry and households, while only a very small part of this water cycle serves as drinking water (Aquastat, 2014) ."
13848,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s413848,INTRODUCTION,"The water used in food production is potable water (i.e., drinking water)."
13849,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s413849,INTRODUCTION,"It may come from a variety of possible sources including surface water such as streams, rivers, lakes, groundwater (e.g., underground natural springs, wells), rainwater, and seawater (after desalination)."
13850,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s413850,INTRODUCTION,The quality of water is essentially dependant on the source of water.
13851,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s413851,INTRODUCTION,"Adequate treatment of the water is necessary to ensure that it meets a drinking water standard which is safe to be used in food production (i.e., safe for human consumption)."
13852,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s413852,INTRODUCTION,The food industry is supplied drinking water primarily in two ways.
13854,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s413854,INTRODUCTION,"In European countries, the majority of drinking water supplied to the food industry comes from public distribution system by government authorities."
13855,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6813855,Chlorination,The most common chemical oxidizing method used for disinfection of water systems is chlorination.
13856,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6813856,Chlorination,It is used as hypochlorite solution (liquid bleach) and chloride dioxide.
13861,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6813861,Chlorination,Automated systems for continuous water chlorination are available.
13862,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6813862,Chlorination,"The main disadvantages of hypochlorite are that it is highly corrosive in its undiluted form, may form unwanted by-products (chloramines, chlorophenol), and will be used up easily by organic matters."
13864,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6913864,Chlorination,It has some advantages over hypochlorite such as being less corrosive.
13865,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6913865,Chlorination,The effectiveness to tackle biofilms is higher compared to hypochlorite and thus this is the preferred method for chlorination.
13866,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3113866,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,The role of water in food storage and preservation is an important consideration from the point of food safety and stability.
13867,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3113867,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,"In general, it is the water activity of food, abbreviated as a w , and not the water content, which determines the lower limit of water for microbial growth (Sandulachi, 2012) ."
13870,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3113870,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,"It is well known that, throughout history, several methods of food preservation like drying and the addition of sugar or salt were prevalent, and they are commonly used even today."
13871,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3113871,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,"These methods have one common principle, which is to keep low water activity."
13873,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3213873,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,"Water activity is defined as ""the ratio of the partial vapor pressure of water in equilibrium with a food to the partial saturation vapor pressure of water vapor in air at the same temperature"" (Fontana, 2000) ."
13874,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3213874,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,This is equivalent to the relative humidity of the air that is in equilibrium with the food.
13876,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3213876,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,"The a w of a food denotes the energy state of water in the food, and therefore it delineates the potential of this water to act as a solvent and participate in chemical/biochemical reactions and growth of microorganisms."
13878,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3213878,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,Water activity values are used by food designers to use water activity to formulate shelf-stable food.
13879,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3213879,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,Mold growth is inhibited if a product is kept below a certain water activity.
13881,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3313881,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,"In food products made with different ingredients, the water activity values can also help to limit moisture migration within a food product."
13882,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3313882,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,"For instance, if raisins of a higher a w are packaged with bran flakes of a lower a w , the water from the raisins migrates to the bran flakes over time, making the raisins hard and the bran flakes soggy."
13883,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3313883,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,Food formulators generally use the water activity principle to predict how much moisture migration affects their product.
13884,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3413884,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,"Colligative effects of dissolved species such as salt or sugar interact with water through dipoleÀdipole, ionic, and hydrogen bonds."
13885,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3413885,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,"Surface interactions in which water interacts directly with chemical groups on undissolved ingredients like starches and proteins are, through dipoleÀdipole forces, ionic bonds (H 3 O or OH 2 ), Van der Waals forces, hydrophobic bonds, and hydrogen bonds."
13886,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3413886,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,"The permutations and combinations of these interactions, in addition to the factors in a food product, lower the energy of the water and consequently decrease the relative humidity as compared to pure water (Fontana, 2001) ."
13889,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s3513889,WATER IN FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION,"The a w for mold and yeast growth inhibition is about 0.61, whereas the lower limit for growth of mycotoxigenic molds is at 0.78 ( Fig. 9 .3)."

13966,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2513966,Water in Processing Operations,"In food processing, there are broad range of possibilities with regard to water management, including increased promotion with increased efficiency of water reuse."
13967,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2513967,Water in Processing Operations,This water reuse efficiency can be enhanced by tailoring the water quality requirements for a specific process.
13968,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2513968,Water in Processing Operations,"The major demand for water arises during diverse food processing operations such as transport of products, dissolving ingredients, treatment of products (e.g., alteration, separation), maintenance of appropriate water content in the final product, cooling processes, steam generation, and abnormal incidents (e.g., fire protection)."
13969,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2613969,Water in Processing Operations,"In general, there are two main types of water reuse that can be identified."
13970,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2613970,Water in Processing Operations,This is relating to whether water comes into direct contact with food product(s) or not.
13971,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2613971,Water in Processing Operations,"Typical reuse applications, where water usually has no such contact, include its use in cooling and for the generation of steam."
13972,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2613972,Water in Processing Operations,"The other category is where water that does have contact with food could be at the raw product stage (e.g., washing or transport), at intermediate stages (e.g., cleaning of equipment), or in the final product itself, which is residual water (ILSI, 2008) ."
13973,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2713973,Water in Processing Operations,The reuse of water by recycling has become an increasingly vital component of food processing operations.
13974,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2713974,Water in Processing Operations,"It is a very essential way to conserve water, reduce costs, and provide security of water supplies."
13975,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2713975,Water in Processing Operations,"Under current legislation in several countries, recycled water can be used in food processing operations or as an ingredient of food, provided that it should be of the same standards as drinking water."
13977,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2813977,Water in Processing Operations,"In some circumstances, nonpotable water is used by the food industry for operations such as for fire control, steam generation, and others."
13978,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2813978,Water in Processing Operations,"In such applications, the water must be clearly identified as nonpotable water and it should not be connected or mixed with the drinking water supply or used directly in food production."
13979,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6713979,Filtration,"Depending upon the contamination risk, the incoming water might be required to pass through a filter that retains solids (e.g., for well-water)."
13981,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6713981,Filtration,The risk of microbiological growth needs to be considered when filters do not constantly receive water.
13982,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s6713982,Filtration,"Therefore, a continuous recirculation of the water is recommended, if no water is consumed."
13983,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2213983,HOT WATER,"In general, hot water sanitization process is commonly used."
13985,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2213985,HOT WATER,The time required for sanitization is determined by the temperature of the water.
13986,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2213986,HOT WATER,The standards of hot water use in dishwashing and utensil sanitizing applications are specified by regulatory authorities in various countries.

13992,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2313992,HOT WATER,There are several advantages of hot-water sanitization.
13994,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2313994,HOT WATER,The disadvantage of hot-water sanitization could be a slow process that requires gradual warm-up and cool-down time.
13997,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4613997,WATER-BORNE FOOD CONTAMINANTS,"In production of safe and ultimately secure food, safety of water assumes fundamental importance."
13998,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4613998,WATER-BORNE FOOD CONTAMINANTS,The safety of water can be discussed by considering the possible hazards to human health.
13999,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4613999,WATER-BORNE FOOD CONTAMINANTS,"The presence of infectious agents, toxic chemicals, and radiological hazards can compromise water quality."
14000,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4614000,WATER-BORNE FOOD CONTAMINANTS,These hazards may arise due to poor quality of water used directly or indirectly in the food production.
14001,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s4614001,WATER-BORNE FOOD CONTAMINANTS,"Therefore, great attention is necessary to learn various health hazards of water such as biological, chemical, or physical pollutants that jeopardize human health."
14003,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7714003,Organic Chemicals,A wide and diverse type of organic chemicals that are released into the air and water consequently end up in the soil.
14007,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7714007,Organic Chemicals,"The excessive and indiscriminate uses of herbicides, insecticides, and nematicides result in soil and water pollution."
14021,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2014021,Thermal Sanitization,"When sanitization involves the use of hot water or steam for a specified temperature and contact time, it is called thermal sanitization."
14024,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7514024,SOIL AND WATER QUALITY,Soils have significant influence on human health due to the amazing ability to remove contaminants from water.
14025,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7514025,SOIL AND WATER QUALITY,This power of water purification of soil is due to the removal of contaminants by physical capture as the water moves through micropore spaces in soil particles.
14027,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7514027,SOIL AND WATER QUALITY,Soils that have desirable properties such as well-developed structure and sufficient organic matter act as efficient filters and purify the surface water as it percolates to lower strata.
14030,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7514030,SOIL AND WATER QUALITY,"Soil and water pollution have historically impacted on food safety, and have serious important threats to human health."

14035,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7514035,SOIL AND WATER QUALITY,"It may directly affect health through drinking water or indirectly through food that accumulate the pollutants such as heavy metals, organic chemicals, or soil pathogens."
14036,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2414036,Water Conditioners,"When mineral content of water increases, particularly calcium and magnesium, the hardness of water also increases, rendering the water unfit for cleaning."
14037,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2414037,Water Conditioners,"In such situations, minerals are deposited in the form of film or scales on the hard surfaces which are in contact with such water for a long time."
14038,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2414038,Water Conditioners,"To prevent the buildup of various such mineral deposits, water conditioners are used."
14041,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s2414041,Water Conditioners,"Examples of some common water softeners are sodium tri-polyphosphate, tetra-potassium pyrophosphate, organo-phosphates, and polyelectrolytes."

14067,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8114067,Soil Pathogens,"In many countries, food safety policies are not integrated with soil and water pollution management policies (Lu et al., 2015) ."
14068,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8114068,Soil Pathogens,"Therefore, it is very essential that a comprehensive map of both soil and water pollution threats to food safety should be prepared together with implementation of integrated policies addressing soil and water pollution."
14077,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s7114077,Ozone Treatment,"Due to its good water solubility, it is very suitable for the disinfection of water systems maintaining a concentration of 0.4 mg/L for 5 minutes (in the presence of spores 2 mg/L)."
14082,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8914082,CONCLUSION,"In food production processes, water quality and its impact on products and operations are generally underestimated."
14083,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8914083,CONCLUSION,"Such underestimation often leads to mismanagement of water, equipment operation and maintenance issues, loss of income, food product quality, and safety."
14084,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8914084,CONCLUSION,"The agricultural sector is the largest consumer of water, compared to any other sector."
14085,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8914085,CONCLUSION,The water footprint of any animal food product is larger than the water footprint of a plant product with equivalent nutritional value.
14086,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8914086,CONCLUSION,"In the world, 29% of the total water footprint of the agricultural sector is related to the production of animal products."
14087,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8914087,CONCLUSION,"The production of meat requires between 6 and 20 times more water as compared to cereals, vegetables, or fruits."
14090,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8914090,CONCLUSION,"Due to the larger dependence on concentrate feed in industrial systems, intensification of animal production systems will result in increasing blue and gray water footprints per unit of animal product."
14091,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8914091,CONCLUSION,The pressure on the global freshwater resources will therefore increase both due to the increasing meat consumption together with the increasing blue and gray water footprint per unit of meat consumed.
14092,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s8914092,CONCLUSION,"Therefore, the biggest opportunity and challenge for future water management for us is to store more green water in soil and plants, as well as to increase the storage as blue water."
14093,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9014093,CONCLUSION,"The ""water activity"" is a key parameter in food storage and preservation."
14095,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9014095,CONCLUSION,Food designers ingeniously use water activity values to formulate shelf-stable food.
14096,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9014096,CONCLUSION,"If a product is kept below a certain value of water activity, mold growth is inhibited."
14098,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9114098,CONCLUSION,The quality of water is the fundamental consideration in any food production process.
14099,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9114099,CONCLUSION,The quality depends on the source of water and the actual application in food production.
14100,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9114100,CONCLUSION,The pollution of water occurs at any stage in various ways.
14102,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9114102,CONCLUSION,Contaminations of water by several pathological microorganisms create major challenges in food safety and jeopardize human and animal health.
14103,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9114103,CONCLUSION,"Water must be free from undesirable taste, odor, color, and impurities including pathogenic organisms that could be harmful to consumers and product quality, when water is used as an ingredient in food."
14104,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9114104,CONCLUSION,The quality of water must adhere to the safe drinking water standard.
14105,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9214105,CONCLUSION,The quality of the water is greatly dependant of the source.
14106,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9214106,CONCLUSION,It is the source of water that generally determines quality.

14111,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9214111,CONCLUSION,Various techniques and methods of water treatments should be used to purify water as per the guidelines of government authorities to improve food safety.
14113,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9314113,CONCLUSION,These hazards may arise due to poor quality of water used directly or indirectly in the food production.
14114,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9314114,CONCLUSION,The majority of water-borne diseases by pathogenic microorganisms are transmitted through contaminated freshwater.
14118,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9314118,CONCLUSION,"Therefore, great attention is necessary to learn various health hazards such as biological, chemical, or physical pollutants in water that jeopardize human health."
14122,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9414122,CONCLUSION,Soil has multiple roles in deciding water quality.
14123,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9414123,CONCLUSION,"Good quality of soil has better ability to remove all types of contaminants of water, whereas deteriorated soil becomes a source of heavy metals, organic chemicals, and soil pathogens in water contamination."
14124,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9414124,CONCLUSION,Water quality controls should start at the source and should also include the review of incoming/used municipal water supplies.
14125,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9414125,CONCLUSION,"It is very essential to build a comprehensive map of both soil and water pollution threats to food safety together with implementation of integrated policies addressing soil and water pollution, which should be an ideal holistic approach in achieving food safety."
14129,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9514129,CONCLUSION,"Thus, there are several challenges in using water for the production of safe and secure food."
14130,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s9514130,CONCLUSION,One must keep a wide vision and rigid policies for use of proper water in food production for safety of human life.
14133,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1414133,Water in Sanitization,"When used in the context of food handling, it implies the complete removal of food soil and associated nonfood visible components using water and detergent chemicals by appropriate methods or processes, under recommended conditions."
14134,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1414134,Water in Sanitization,The most important first step is flushing with water to remove visible soil.
14136,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1414136,Water in Sanitization,"In all practical purposes, the quality of water used for cleaning and washing should be similar to potable water."
14144,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1514144,Water in Sanitization,"In chemical sanitization, water is used as medium or vehicle for more effective and efficient cleaning and sanitization."
14145,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1514145,Water in Sanitization,It is imperative to understand basic water chemistry and microbiology before selecting a cleaning compound.
14149,8s1lw59s,8s1lw59s1514149,Water in Sanitization,"The recommended microbiological guidelines for water destined for final cleaned water must have total plate count ,500 mL À1 , coliform ,1 mL À1 , and psychotrophs ,10 mL À1 (ILSI, 2008) ."

22142,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm1722142,Safety ::: Results,There were 4 serious gastrointestinal adverse events in the lopinavir–ritonavir group but none in the standard-care group; all 4 events were judged by the investigators to be related to the trial medication.
22145,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm1822145,Discussion,This randomized trial found that lopinavir–ritonavir treatment added to standard supportive care was not associated with clinical improvement or mortality in seriously ill patients with Covid-19 different from that associated with standard care alone.
22149,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm1922149,Discussion,"In a post hoc subgroup analysis, the difference in mortality between the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group was observed to be numerically greater among patients treated within 12 days after the onset of symptoms than among those treated later."
22150,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm1922150,Discussion,The question of whether earlier lopinavir–ritonavir treatment in Covid-19 could have clinical benefit is an important one that requires further study.
22151,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm1922151,Discussion,"The finding is consistent with studies showing that patients with SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia have progression in the second week of illness1 and with the time-to-treatment effects observed in previous antiviral studies in SARS20 and severe influenza.21-23 In addition, we found that the numbers of lopinavir–ritonavir recipients who had serious complications (acute kidney injury and secondary infections) or requiring noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure were fewer than in those not receiving treatment."
22152,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm1922152,Discussion,These observations are hypothesis-generating and require additional studies to determine whether lopinavir–ritonavir treatment given at a certain stage of illness can reduce some complications in Covid-19.
22153,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2022153,Discussion,We did not find that adding lopinavir–ritonavir treatment reduced viral RNA loads or duration of viral RNA detectability as compared with standard supportive care alone.
22154,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2022154,Discussion,SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still detected in 40.7% of the patients in the lopinavir–ritonavir group at end of the trial (day 28).
22155,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2022155,Discussion,A recent report showed that the median duration of viral shedding in Covid-19 was 20 days in patients with severe illness and could be as long as 37 days.24 Neither that study nor the current one found evidence that lopinavir–ritonavir exerted a significant antiviral effect.
22159,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2022159,Discussion,"Of note, depending on cell type used, the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of lopinavir in vitro for SARS-CoV has ranged from 4.0 to 10.7 μg per milliliter,5,6,8 although other studies reported that lopinavir was inactive26 or that higher concentrations (25 μg per milliliter) were required for inhibition.7 For MERS-CoV, the EC50 values have ranged from 5 to approximately 7 μg per milliliter).1,8,13 Both the mean peak (9.6 μg per milliliter) and trough (5.5 μg per milliliter) serum concentrations of lopinavir in adults just approach these concentrations."
22160,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2022160,Discussion,Whether the EC50 value is an adequate threshold and whether unbound lopinavir concentrations in human plasma are sufficient for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 are questionable.1
22161,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2122161,Discussion,Nearly 14% of lopinavir–ritonavir recipients were unable to complete the full 14-day course of administration.
22165,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2122165,Discussion,The side-effect profile observed in the current trial arouses concern about the use of higher or more prolonged lopinavir–ritonavir dose regimens in efforts to improve outcomes.
22169,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2222169,Discussion,"The characteristics of the patients at baseline were generally balanced across the two groups, but the somewhat higher throat viral loads in the lopinavir–ritonavir group raise the possibility that this group had more viral replication."
22171,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2222171,Discussion,"In addition, approximately 45% and 40% of the patients in lopinavir–ritonavir group had positive RNA detection by throat swabs on day 14 and day 28, respectively, but we do not know if infectious virus was still present, since we did not attempt virus isolation or assess the possible emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir."
22172,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2222172,Discussion,"Finally, we do not have data on the lopinavir exposure levels in these seriously and often critically ill patients."
22173,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2322173,Discussion,"In conclusion, we found that lopinavir–ritonavir treatment did not significantly accelerate clinical improvement, reduce mortality, or diminish throat viral RNA detectability in patients with serious Covid-19."
22175,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm2322175,Discussion,"Whether combining lopinavir–ritonavir with other antiviral agents, as has been done in SARS5,20 and is being studied in MERS-CoV,15 might enhance antiviral effects and improve clinical outcomes remains to be determined."
22177,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm022177,Patients ::: Methods,"Male and nonpregnant female patients 18 years of age or older were eligible if they had a diagnostic specimen that was positive on RT-PCR, had pneumonia confirmed by chest imaging, and had an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2)"

22187,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm1522187,Virology ::: Results,The mean (±SD) baseline viral RNA loads in the throat swabs taken after consent were slightly higher in the lopinavir–ritonavir group than in the standard-care group at randomization (4.4±2.0 log10 copies per milliliter vs. 3.7±2.1) (Table 2).
22188,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm1522188,Virology ::: Results,"The viral RNA loads over time did not differ between the lopinavir–ritonavir recipients and those receiving standard care (Figure 3), including analysis according to duration of illness (Fig. S6)."
22189,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm1622189,Virology ::: Results,"The percentage of patients with detectable viral RNA for SARS-CoV-2 was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group on any sampling day (day 5, 34.5% vs. 32.9%; day 10, 50.0% vs. 48.6%; day 14, 55.2% vs. 57.1%; day 21, 58.6% vs. 58.6%; and day 28, 60.3% vs. 58.6%) (Table S2)."
22196,h4cu63cm,h4cu63cm1322196,Secondary Outcomes ::: Results,"The 28-day mortality was numerically lower in the lopinavir–ritonavir group than in the standard-care group for either the intention-to-treat population (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, −5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −17.3 to 5.7) or the modified intention-to treat population (16.7% vs. 25.0%; difference, −8.3 percentage points; 95% CI, −19.6 to 3.0) (Table 3)."

Le traitement adjuvant recommandé et débuté idéalement dans les quatre semaines après la chirurgie est : pour les cancers triples négatifs pT1N0 et en l'absence de contre-indication en évaluant le rapport bénéfice/risque : quatre cycles de docétaxel (75 mg/m 2 ) et cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m 2 ) avec facteurs de croissance de la lignée blanche. Pour les cancers HER2 positifs pT1N0 et en l'absence de contreindication en évaluant le rapport bénéfice/risque : quatre cycles de paclitaxel hebdomadaire (80 mg/m 2 ) avec trastuzumab (idéalement par voie sous-cutanée) toutes les trois semaines, puis trastuzumab pour un an. En l'absence de réactions allergiques après les deux premières injections de paclitaxel, l'administration de corticoïdes peut être suspendue [18] . Dans les autres cas, en situation néoadjuvante et adjuvante, les indications restent identiques. Cependant, nous rappelons plusieurs adaptations fortement recommandées : en cas de doute sur le bénéfice de la chimiothérapie adjuvante pour les cancers hormonodépendants, l'utilisation des signatures transcriptomiques pour la désescalade raisonnée de chimiothérapie aide à la prise de décision. En cas d'indication de chimiothérapie pour cette population, elle peut être différée jusqu'à six semaines après la chirurgie ; en cas d'indication de chimiothérapie, la pose d'un PAC® n'est pas contre-indiquée, mais ceux-ci étant souvent posés par des anesthésistes réanimateurs. Il est important d'anticiper leur pose dans le contexte d'une recrudescence des activités de réanimation liées à la pandémie ; privilégier l'administration à domicile des traitements de maintenance anti-HER2 ; éviter l'administration de corticoïdes à visée antiémétique ; utiliser des facteurs de croissance de la lignée blanche dès le risque intermédiaire de neutropénie [19] ; utiliser préférentiellement des schémas permettant de réduire le nombre de passages dans les hôpitaux (schémas toutes les trois semaines plutôt qu'hebdomadaires). Si un schéma par paclitaxel hebdomadaire est privilégié, en l'absence de réactions allergiques après les deux premières injections de paclitaxel, l'administration de corticoïdes peut être suspendue [17] ; une durée totale du traitement de chimiothérapie de 18 semaines doit être privilégiée (six cycles/trois semaines) ; l'utilisation d'un schéma dose-dense n'est pas contreindiquée ; l'utilisation de la capécitabine ou de T-DM1 en situation adjuvante en l'absence de pCR respectivement pour la population triple négative ou HER2 positive n'est pas contre-indiquée. "
6323,uyk160ay,uyk160ay36323,Diagnostic,"En ce qui concerne la technique diagnostique, l'OMS recommande de prélever des échantillons à la fois dans les voies respiratoires supérieures (échantillons naso-et oropharyngés) et dans les voies respiratoires inférieures telles que les expectorations, l'aspiration endotrachéale ou le lavage bronchoalvéolaire. La collecte des échantillons de lavage broncho-alvéolaire ne doit normalement être effectuée que chez les patients ventilés mécaniquement, car les échantillons des voies respiratoires inférieures semblent rester positifs pendant une période plus longue. Les échantillons nécessitent un stockage à quatre degrés Celsius. En laboratoire, l'amplification du matériel génétique extrait de l'échantillon de salive ou de mucus se fait par une réaction en chaîne par polymérase inverse (RT-PCR). Si le résultat du test est positif, il est recommandé de répéter le test pour vérification. Chez les patients dont le diagnostic de COVID-19 a été confirmé, l'évaluation en laboratoire peut être répétée pour évaluer la clairance virale. Le diagnostic positif peut également être fortement évoqué par scanner sans injection. Les images scannographiques thoraciques de COVID-19 sont assez caractéristiques et différenciantes des autres pneumonies virales classiques ou d'atteintes pulmonaires liées à d'autres causes. Il s'agit d'une distribution périphérique, avec opacités en verre dépoli, opacités réticulaires fines et des épaississements vasculaires, avec peu d'extension centrale, absence d'épanchement pleural et de lymphadénopathie [5] . En ce qui concerne la population à tester, les avis divergent selon les différents stades de la maladie, les politiques de santé des pays confrontés à cette pandémie et la disponibilité des tests. En France, les recommandations sont disponibles sur un site dédié [6] ."
6324,uyk160ay,uyk160ay26324,Transmission,"Étant donné que les premiers cas de la maladie CoVID-19 étaient liés à une exposition directe au marché de gros de Huanan Seafood à Wuhan, la transmission de l'animal à l'homme était présumée être le principal mécanisme. Néanmoins, les cas ultérieurs n'étaient pas associés à ce mécanisme d'exposition et il a été conclu que le virus pouvait être transmis d'humain à humain. Comme pour les autres pathogènes respiratoires, dont la grippe et les rhinovirus, la transmission se produit par le biais de gouttelettes respiratoires provenant de la toux et des éternuements. La transmission d'aérosols est également possible en cas d'exposition prolongée à des concentrations élevées d'aérosols dans des espaces clos. L'analyse des données relatives à la propagation du SARS-CoV-2 en Chine semble indiquer qu'un contact étroit entre les individus est nécessaire. En fait, la propagation est principalement limitée aux membres de la famille, aux professionnels de la santé et à d'autres contacts étroits. Ces données suggèrent que l'utilisation de l'isolement est le meilleur moyen de contenir cette épidémie. Par ailleurs, comme les autres CoV, SARS-CoV-2 est sensible aux rayons ultraviolets, à la chaleur et peut être efficacement inactivé par des solvants lipidiques, comme l'éther (75 %), l'éthanol, les désinfectants contenant du chlore, l'acide peroxyacétique et le chloroforme, à l'exception de la chlorhexidine [3] . Toutefois, certaines études rapportent la possibilité d'une persistance de la présence de SARS-CoV-2 jusqu'à trois heures dans l'air et troisjours sur certaines surfaces (plastiques et métaux) expliquant peut-être le degré de contagiosité élevé du virus [4] ."

8696,jwivka1t,jwivka1t28696,Evidence on the Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,"These biases include protopathic bias, where ibuprofen is used to relieve symptoms of a viral infection, including COVID-19, making it seem like ibuprofen is the culprit."
8698,jwivka1t,jwivka1t28698,Evidence on the Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,Patients with more severe viral infections including influenza or COVID-19 are more likely to use a stronger antiinflammatory drug such as ibuprofen than acetaminophen.
8699,jwivka1t,jwivka1t28699,Evidence on the Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,"Therefore, a potential harmful outcome is more likely to be caused by a more severe infection for which ibuprofen is prescribed, rather than the drug."
8702,jwivka1t,jwivka1t48702,Evidence on the Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,"However, having the ideal data source might be a challenge for this study because it needs to adequately address confounding, especially confounding by disease severity and measurement error (also referred to as misclassification of exposure), because many people use ibuprofen over the counter in addition to prescription medication."
8703,jwivka1t,jwivka1t58703,Evidence on the Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,"In summary, the current epidemiologic evidence is not strong enough to infer a causal link of a harmful effect of ibuprofen in patients with COVID-19."
8704,jwivka1t,jwivka1t58704,Evidence on the Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,Evidence from mechanistic studies alone should not be used to make strong statements against use of ibuprofen.
8705,jwivka1t,jwivka1t58705,Evidence on the Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,"Given the current strength of the evidence on this topic, we advise that patients use acetaminophen monotherapy for fever reduction in a patient with COVID-19, as per the WHO recommendations."
8706,jwivka1t,jwivka1t58706,Evidence on the Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,"3 If acetaminophen alone cannot achieve its antipyretic effect, the current evidence is not sufficient to advise against coadministration of ibuprofen with acetaminophen; however, risk of adding ibuprofen should still be assessed against its benefits."
8708,jwivka1t,jwivka1t08708,Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,"As the number of cases of COVD-19 continues to rise, the mainstay therapy for those with mild-to-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 remains to be supportive therapy, which includes use of analgesics such as ibuprofen."
8709,jwivka1t,jwivka1t18709,Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,Recent reports of a potential harm with ibuprofen in patients with COVID-19 has received significant international media coverage.
8710,jwivka1t,jwivka1t18710,Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,The news started when an infectious disease specialist in France anecdotally reported four cases of children who took ibuprofen and experienced worsening symptoms of COVID-19 infection in her clinic.
8712,jwivka1t,jwivka1t18712,Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19,"1,2 Other professional entities including the National Health Services and the British Pharmacological Society have taken a more balanced tone suggesting that patients use acetaminophen as the first drug of choice until more evidence is collected."

9219,jb4nxjnp,jb4nxjnp29219,Clozapine prescription in the wake of the coronavirus (SARS CoV -2) outbreak: what measures?

L'inhalation de l'excès de salive induit par la clozapine est responsable de pneumonies, dites d'aspiration (5) qui représentent une part importante de ces infections pulmonaires. D'autres pneumonies communautaires, iatrogènes ou non spécifiques, également plus fréquentes chez les patients sous clozapine (3), soulèvent la question d'une action immunosuppressive de cette molécule."
9220,jb4nxjnp,jb4nxjnp39220,Clozapine prescription in the wake of the coronavirus (SARS CoV -2) outbreak: what measures? Why?,"Cette action passe en partie par une réduction des taux circulants des immunoglobulines (Ig) des trois classes (6) . L'hypogammaglobulinémie observée concerne également les Ig G spécifiques antihaemophilus influenza et pneumocoques, pathogènes communs du tractus respiratoire. L'ampleur de l'action immunosuppressive de la clozapine est comparable à celle de l'association rituximabmethotrexate (7) . Elle est d'autant plus marquée que la durée de traitement par la clozapine est longue et ne semble pas être dose dépendante (6, 7) . Il est toutefois important de souligner les nombreux rapports de cas, associant dose élevée de clozapine et infection sévère (8) . La survenue de ces infections se complique en retour d'une élévation des concentrations plasmatiques de la clozapine par inhibition des cytochromes 1A2 et 3A4 par les médiateurs de l'inflammation (TNFα, IL-6 et CRP) entraînant hypersédation et confusion mentale (9) ."

Los malos resultados globales en términos de respuesta clínica y mortalidad condujeron en pocas horas a una ola de pesimismo inusitado en los grupos de profesionales encargados de tomar las decisiones en muchos hospitales. Esto se reflejo en acaloradas discusiones vía WhatsApp y otros foros, condicionando la abrupta retirada de lopinavir/ritonavir de los protocolos terapéuticos de varios grandes centros de nuestro país."

Los propios autores reconocen estos aspectos en la discusión. La asignación de pacientes no fue ciega y no se pudo establecer el deseable control con placebo para los pacientes que no recibieron el fármaco en dicho estudio.

Asumiendo las mismas premisas que para la variable principal, se hubieran necesitado entre 200 y 860 pacientes en cada brazo para demostrar diferencias. Además, aunque globalmente el beneficio queda diluido, una lectura atenta permite observar como el uso de lopinavir/ritonavir podría apuntar una tendencia a la reducción de la mortalidad si se utiliza en los primeros 12 días. En los pacientes tratados más precozmente sí se consigue el objetivo primario, siendo la mortalidad respectiva del 15 versus el 27 % en cada rama. Aún más, los otros objetivos secundarios como la estancia en cuidados intensivos (5 días de diferencia) y el porcentaje de desarrollo de SDRA (12 versus 24%) también salen favorecidos."

Por ello, aunque no se alcanza el objetivo primario, los resultados apuntan a que el grupo tratado podría evolucionar mejor. Por tanto, queda por determinar si la utilización de lopinavir/ritonavir en fases más precoces y/o en combinación con otros fármacos potencialmente activos supone o no supone un beneficio para los pacientes."

3270,owbv8ua4,owbv8ua413270,Introduction,"Although a study conducted by Sima (http://www.simaonlus.it/w, 2020) has showed that pollution has played a key role in the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 there is no evidence about if pollution may have had an impact on communities exposed to toxic air in terms of worsening of initial health status in order to be considered an additional cofactor of SARS-CoV-2 lethality."
3272,owbv8ua4,owbv8ua423272,Introduction,"A team of researchers at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute by using data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA's Aura satellite, revealed that Northern Italy is one of Europe's most polluted areas in terms of smog and air pollution also due to its climatic and geographic conditions, which cause the stagnation of pollutants (Earth Observatory."
3274,owbv8ua4,owbv8ua423274,Introduction,"The European Environment Agency (EEA) has recently introduced an aggregated index named as Air Quality Index (AQI), index reflecting the potential impact of air quality on health, driven by the pollutants in geographical regions."
3275,owbv8ua4,owbv8ua423275,Introduction,"It is calculated hourly for more than two thousand air quality monitoring stations across Europe, using upto-date data reported by EEA member countries (European Air Quality Inde)."
3279,owbv8ua4,owbv8ua473279,Conclusions,"Moreover, as we previously pointed out, a prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory stimulus, even in young and healthy subjects."
3280,owbv8ua4,owbv8ua483280,Conclusions,"This, in our opinion, may partly explain a higher prevalence and lethality of a novel, very contagious, viral agent such as SARS-CoV-2, among a population living in areas with a higher level of air pollution, particularly if we consider the relatively high average age of this population."
3281,owbv8ua4,owbv8ua483281,Conclusions,"Among elderly living in such a region and affected by other comorbidities, the cilia and upper airways defenses could have been weakened both by age and chronic exposure to air pollution, which, in turn, could facilitate virus invasion by allowing virus reaching lower airways."
3282,owbv8ua4,owbv8ua483282,Conclusions,"Subsequently, a dysregulated, weak immune system, triggered by chronic air pollution exposure may lead to ARDS and eventually death, particularly in case of severe respiratory and cardiovascular comorbidities."
3283,owbv8ua4,owbv8ua483283,Conclusions,"Moreover, since the prolonged exposure to atmospheric pollution could induce persistent modifications of the immune system (Tsai et al., 2019) , short-term changes in the air quality may not be sufficient to break this vicious circle."
3284,owbv8ua4,owbv8ua483284,Conclusions,"This might be supported by the persistent high fatality rate, despite the dramatical reduction of air pollution levels in Lombardy since the start of the outbreak."
3286,owbv8ua4,owbv8ua483286,Conclusions,"Important factors such as the age structure of the affected population, the wide differences among Italian regional health systems, capacity of the intensive care units in the region, and the prevention policies taken by the Government have had a paramount role in the spreading of SARS-CoV-2, presumably more than the air pollution itself."

24594,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap9324594,Biological Defense and Bio-threat Applications,"For example, pathogen-based bio-threat situations typically involve the overt or covert introduction of an exogenous pathogen into either the food or water supply or environments which with humans closely interact (Cirino et al. 2004; Mirski et al. 2014; Shah and Wilkins 2003) ."
24599,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap9524599,Biological Defense and Bio-threat Applications,"While pathogen-based bio-threats may be introduced to the water and food supply, the detection of pathogen-based bio-threats in air is critical to biowarfare defense, as they may be introduced into the battlefield in the form of aerosols."
24600,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap9524600,Biological Defense and Bio-threat Applications,"Further, the dispersal of pathogen-based bio-threats by air in facilities (e.g., via air-handling systems) represents a significant domestic bioterrorism concern."

24665,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap124665,Introduction,"In cases of limited antibody availability, need for highly sensitive results, or infections that do not generate a significant level of antibody production in the organism although the pathogen is present, DNA-based assays are also commonly employed, particularly in water safety applications."
24679,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap424679,Introduction,"To date, electrochemical biosensors have enabled sample preparation-free detection of pathogens in various sample matrices, in situ detection of pathogens on the surfaces of objects, rapid pathogen detection using low-cost biosensors, multiplexed detection of pathogens in practical sample matrices, and detection of pathogens via wireless actuation and data acquisition formats."
24680,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap424680,Introduction,"As a result, electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection have been widely examined for food and water safety, medical diagnostic, environmental monitoring, and bio-threat applications (Amiri et al. 2018; Duffy and Moore 2017; Felix and Angnes 2018; Furst and Francis 2019; Mishra et al. 2018; Monzó et al. 2015; Rastogi and Singh 2019) ."
24777,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap10424777,"Low-cost, Single-Use Portable Biosensors",The need for water safety and medical diagnostics in remote and under-developed regions has led to the demand for low-cost portable biosensing platforms.
24802,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap3824802,Phages,"In that study, they found that bacteriophages improved the water stability of the sensor and increased the sensitivity by approximately a factor of four relative to the response obtained with antibodies based on EIS measurements (Mejri et al. 2010) ."
24804,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap3824804,Phages,These results suggest that bacteriophages are potentially attractive biorecognition elements for water safety and environmental monitoring applications that require chronic monitoring of liquids.
24808,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap6424808,Linear Sweep and Cyclic Voltammetry,Hong et al. used sweep voltammetry to detect norovirus in a sample solution with Fe(CN) 6 3-/4extracted from lettuce (Hong et al. 2015) .
24901,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8524901,Environmental Monitoring and Infection Control Applications,"However, here we choose to distinguish environmental monitoring applications, which require pathogen detection in the environment (e.g., air or surfaces of objects), from medical diagnostics applications, which require detection in body fluids."
24903,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8524903,Environmental Monitoring and Infection Control Applications,"Similar to food and water safety applications, which require biosensors capable of analyzing pathogencontaining complex matrices, such as a water or food matrix, environmental pathogens are present in multiple types of matrices."
24904,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8524904,Environmental Monitoring and Infection Control Applications,"While environmental pathogens can enter the body through the consumption of food or water, they can also be transmitted through aerosols or interaction with other organisms that serve as vectors for the infectious agent, such as mosquitos in the case of Plasmodium falciparum (the infectious agent associated with malaria)."
24905,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8524905,Environmental Monitoring and Infection Control Applications,"Thus, the detection of environmental pathogens often requires analysis of matrices, such as air and liquids, and objects, such as the surfaces of biomedical devices or objects within healthcare facilities, that are present in the human environment (Lai et al. 2009 )."
24916,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8824916,Environmental Monitoring and Infection Control Applications,"However, they also require assays for the detection of pathogens in air and aerosols."
24917,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8824917,Environmental Monitoring and Infection Control Applications,"In addition to transmission via air and water, environmental pathogens also travel by direct surface contact (similar to foodborne pathogens), which is known as a significant mode of transmission in healthcare settings (e.g., of healthcare-acquired infections)."
24924,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8824924,Environmental Monitoring and Infection Control Applications,"Toxin-producing algae, such as cyanobacteria and sulphatereducing bacteria, are also important targets for electrochemical biosensors associated with the prevention of water-based diseases."
24930,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap1724930,As shown in,"For example, Chartuprayoon et al. used Au microelectrode arrays modified with polypyrrole nanoribbons to detect cucumber mosaic virus (Chartuprayoon et al. 2013) ."
24943,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap2124943,As shown in,"For example, Hong et al. fabricated a nanostructured Au electrode via electrochemical deposition of gold (III) chloride hydrates for the detection of norovirus in lettuce extracts (Hong et al. 2015) ."
24958,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap5124958,Sample Handling Formats,"As discussed in further detail in the following sections, pathogens are present in liquid and solid matrices (e.g., food and water) and on the surface of objects (e.g., biomedical devices)."
24966,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap5224966,Sample Handling Formats,"For example, commerciallyavailable blood glucose meters use a droplet-based assay format (Vashist et al. 2011 )."
24969,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap5324969,Sample Handling Formats,"One of the most critical considerations associated with application of droplet-based formats to pathogen detection is sampling, specifically if sufficient sampling has been performed on the system for which bioanalytical information is desired (e.g., a human, a food source, or source of drinking water)."
24973,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap5324973,Sample Handling Formats,"Thus, the sampling approach should be considered when examining droplet-based formats for food and water safety applications."
24996,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap5724996,Sample Handling Formats,"For example, droplet-based low-cost disposable biosensors for water safety are typically single-use, while biosensors for process monitoring applications can be recalibrated to characterize multiple samples and provide continuous monitoring."
25004,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8125004,Food and Water Safety Applications,Foodborne and waterborne pathogens originate from a variety of sources and matrices and typically infect humans through the consumption of contaminated food and water.
25007,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8225007,Food and Water Safety Applications,"While biosensors for pathogen detection are critical to water and food safety in developed regions, biosensors are particularly important aspects of public healthcare in remote and underdeveloped regions due to relatively reduced infrastructure and resources for food and water quality analysis."
25008,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8225008,Food and Water Safety Applications,"For example, in 2014, a cholera outbreak linked to V. cholerae in Ghana, which has been associated with poor environmental water management and sanitation issues, infected over 20,000 individuals (Ohene-Adjei et al. 2017) ."
25009,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8225009,Food and Water Safety Applications,The selective detection of pathogens in food and water remains a global healthcare challenge.
25010,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8225010,Food and Water Safety Applications,Several comprehensive reviews have been written on biosensors for food and water safety (Baeumner 2003; Bozal-Palabiyik et al. 2018; Leonard et al. 2003; Ye et al. 2018) .
25015,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8325015,Food and Water Safety Applications,"Given the extensive use of immunoassays in food and water safety, such as ELISA, it is possible to obtain commercially-available monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for a large number of foodborne and waterborne pathogens."
25017,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8425017,Food and Water Safety Applications,"Alternatively, those for water safety applications in under-developed regions may require alternative biosensor designs and measurement formats that facilitate field use, such as sample preparation-free protocols."
25018,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8425018,Food and Water Safety Applications,"Pathogens can also enter food and water through processing, packaging, distribution, and storage processes (e.g., via workers and pests) (Beuchat et al. 2013; Mehrotra 2016; Ye et al. 2018) ."
25019,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8425019,Food and Water Safety Applications,"As a result, biosensors for food and water safety applications should facilitate pathogen detection in various stages of the food and water processing systems."
25020,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8425020,Food and Water Safety Applications,"Recent advances in electrochemical biosensors for food and water safety applications have established new low-cost sensor designs, portable measurement formats, and flexible form-factors and are discussed further in the following sections."
25022,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap10025022,Detection of Plant Pathogens,"For example, crop yield losses associated with plant pathogens range from 8.1 to 41.1% based on global production of wheat, rice, maize, potato, and soybean (Savary et al. 2019) ."
25067,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap7825067,Secondary Binding Approaches,Xu et al. used glucose oxidase and monoclonal anti-S. typhimurium to functionalize magnetic bead labels for separation and detection of S. typhimurium on an Au IDAM using EIS and glucose to catalyze the reaction that exhibited a linear working range of 10 2 to 10 6 CFU/mL (Xu et al. 2016b ).
25083,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap10225083,Saturation-free Continuous Monitoring Formats,"This can be accomplished through acid-base mediated regeneration, detergents, glycine, and urea as well as achieved by thermal regeneration, plasma cleaning, or even direct electrochemical desorption (Goode et al. 2015; Huang et al. 2010; Zelada-Guillen et al. 2010) ."
25084,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap10225084,Saturation-free Continuous Monitoring Formats,"For example, Dweik et al. used a combination of organic (acetone) and plasma cleaning protocols to regenerate an Au interdigitated microelectrode array after detection of E. coli to use devices five times each (Dweik et al. 2012 )."
25107,cxa2ugap,cxa2ugap8025107,Applications to Pathogen Detection,"We next review applications of electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection in food and water safety, environmental monitoring and infection control, medical diagnostics, and bio-threat defense."

Cette épidémie impose des bouleversements dans nos organisations en établissements de santé qui ne doivent pas occulter l'importance du soin nutritionnel pour tous les patients qui le nécessitent. Le diagnostic nutritionnel et la prise en charge nutritionnelle précoce des patients infectés Covid-19 doivent être intégrés dans la stratégie thérapeutique globale, comme pour toute situation aiguë d'agression métabolique. Ce document a été élaboré par la Société Francophone de Nutrition Clinique et Métabolisme (SFNCM) dans l'urgence de la crise sanitaire par un groupe d'experts, en se basant sur les recommandations nationales et internationales disponibles dans le domaine de la dénutrition, des états d'agression métaboliques aigus et de la réanimation à la date du 23 mars 2020. Nous espérons qu'il apportera aux professionnels de santé, surtout non spécialisés en nutrition, des repères utiles pour la prise en charge des patients hospitalisés, infectés ou non par le Covid-19, en cette période d'épidémie et de confinement intra-hospitalier. La prise en charge nutritionnelle est adaptée de façon graduée et personnalisée en fonction de la sévérité de la dénutrition, en accord avec l'arbre décisionnel du soin nutritionnel ( Figure   1 ) [5] : principalement, alimentation enrichie avec ou sans compléments nutritionnels oraux, ou nutrition entérale par sonde naso-gastrique. Les protocoles de traitement nutritionnel en vigueur dans l'établissement restent inchangés, mais leurs modalités pratiques peuvent se voir modifier durant la période d'épidémie: exemple : limitation des possibilités de consultation physique des équipes diététiques ou de l'unité transversale de nutrition, nécessitant de recourir à des consultations téléphoniques y compris en intra-établissement.

Il complète le document général de la SFNCM sur l'adaptation de la prise en charge des patients hospitalisés (COVID-19 et autres) en date du 23 mars 2020 (2). (5) Le ministère a demandé aux prestataires de soinsdistributeurs de matériel (PSDM) de limiter leurs visites, tant dans nos établissements qu'au domicile des patients. Cela implique que : -si les évaluations des patients se font à distance, le poids est déclaratif ; -dans ces conditions, il faut que le PSDM demande au patient de se peser (seul ou avec l'aide de l'infirmier libéral (IDEL ; -pour les enfants et surtout les nourrissons sans balance ou pèse-bébé à domicile, la mesure par le PSDM doit se poursuivre ; -les PSDM de petite taille risquent d'avoir des difficultés à fonctionner ; le prescripteur de la NAD doit donc le vérifier avec le PSDM ; -il faut également vérifier que les procédures et liens de contact (patient-centre prescripteur ou patient-PSDM-centre prescripteur) fonctionnent, en particulier en prévision d'un besoin non programmé ou d'une urgence ; -Le PSDM pourra être amené, à la demande du prescripteur ou du patient, à intervenir au domicile du patient ; -En cas de venue dans l'établissement d'un patient, aidant ou personnel de PSDM, le port d'un masque est indispensable. point avec les PSDM.

Enfin, l'effet des traitements hormonaux et du trastuzumab sur la progression tumorale est bien démontré et pourrait annuler le facteur prolifératif dans nos équations. Un autre paramètre à prendre en compte est le délai entre la chirurgie et le début de la radiothérapie ; là encore, les données sont discordantes. Classiquement, il doit être inférieur à 12 semaines [21] . Cependant ces données sont anciennes, et ne prenaient pas en compte la biologie de la tumeur et la qualité des marges chirurgicales (très probablement inférieures à celles réclamée aujourd'hui). Il est important de savoir que même si la radiothérapie a été retardée de plusieurs mois, elle améliore la survie, que ce soit après une mastectomie ou un traitement conservateur [22] .

19302,9vrny92m,9vrny92m1819302,Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine,Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are widely used anti-malarial drugs with well-known immunomodulatory properties that have extended their use to several immuno-rheumatological diseases including RA [83] .
19303,9vrny92m,9vrny92m1819303,Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine,The ability of chloroquine to produce an anti-viral effect has been known since the late 1960s [84] .

19325,9vrny92m,9vrny92m1419325,tsDMARDs,"Data from tofacitinib pooled population enrolled in RCTs showed an HZV incidence rate of 4.0 per 100 patient-years (with greater incidence in geographic area with high HZV endemicity), doubling the rates of RA patients not receiving JAKis [67] ."
19326,9vrny92m,9vrny92m1419326,tsDMARDs,"A similar picture has also been observed in the overall development program of baricitinib, with an incidence rate of 3.2 cases per patient-years [68] ."
19327,9vrny92m,9vrny92m1419327,tsDMARDs,"The subsequent real-life experience from US claim databases revealed that the risk of HZV was higher in patients receiving tofacitinib compared to those treated with abatacept (aHR 2.01 (95% CI 1.40; 2.88) [69] , and the risk of serious hospitalized HZV infection is 2fold higher versus all bDMARDs [70] ."
19328,9vrny92m,9vrny92m1419328,tsDMARDs,"Older age, female sex, prednisone > 7.5 mg/day, prior infection, and greater number of hospitalizations were associated with increased HZV risk, whereas vaccination was associated with a lower risk [71] ."
19329,9vrny92m,9vrny92m1419329,tsDMARDs,"More recent reports from RCTs conducted with novel JAK-1 selective inhibitors upadacitinib and filgotinib have basically confirmed the same trend, suggesting that the increase in HZV infections can be considered as a class effect of JAKis [72, 73] ."
